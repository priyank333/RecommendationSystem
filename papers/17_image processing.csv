Health informatics is important as it provides quick predictions on diseases based on nearness of symptoms. Modelling solutions for the same on cloud using deep learning is the motivation of this paper. Here, we propose a deep learning model associated with correlation based feature selection method for cirrhosis image classification. We compare the results with three other conventional classifiers algorithms to improve the better classification accuracy. First in pre-processing stage, noises are eliminated from pathological scan images by using modified laplacian pyramid non-linear diffusion filter. From the pre-processed scan images, each cirrhosis region is obtained under the guidance of radiology or physicians. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch by gray level, local binary pattern and scale invariant feature, a feature selection technique is applied to choice the predominant texture features for each classifier. Finally a convolution neural network is implemented to improve the performance of classifiers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Convolution neural network algorithm with two hidden layers gives more accuracy in classifying cirrhosis image with 98% sensitivity. Experiments are carried out with 990 cirrhosis image patches which demonstrates that our proposed deep learning classifier perform 100% well than original classifiers in terms of accuracy. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Convolution neural network; Correlation based feature selection; Liver cirrhosis classification; Modified diffusion filter; Texture features,Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Medical imaging; Ultrasonic applications; Classification accuracy; Convolution neural network; Diffusion filter; Feature selection methods; Liver cirrhosis; Performance of classifier; Scale invariant features; Texture features; Classification (of information),"Suganya, R.; Department of Information Technology, Thiagarajar College of EngineeringIndia; email: rsuganya@tce.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039695155

In order to resolve this problem, the player’s identification number (which is printed on their jersey) is recognized and based on the number, players are identified. This paper proposes a noble Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that automatically extracts and recognizes the player’s jersey number in the image. A hierarchical computational framework is introduced which uses high and low-level vision features of the image to identify the player. While following the hierarchical approach a parsing tree is constructed by segmenting the image into snippets based on different algorithms. The entire parsing tree is divided into 4 levels: Level 1 deals with the playfield detection and shot classification, Level 2 tackles the player localization and extraction, Level 3 covers the player’s number extraction and shape restoration, and Level 4 recognizes the player’s number. The proposed OCR system has consistently shown outstanding results in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness over a large soccer dataset. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Hierarchical framework; Optical character recognition; Pattern recognition; Player identification; Sports image analysis,Extraction; Forestry; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Pattern recognition; Sports; Video signal processing; Computational framework; Hierarchical approach; Hierarchical framework; Identification number; Optical character recognition (OCR); Player localizations; Player recognition; Shot classification; Image processing,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Active research has been ongoing to mitigate the impact of these catastrophes and preclude the economic losses. The existing methods that utilize pre-event and post-event images not only require the immediate and guaranteed availability of the appropriate data set but are also encumbered by manual mapping of the images, necessitating the indication of corresponding control points in the two images. This paper highlights the use of only post-event imagery in the absence of reference data to achieve a more timely delivery to produce damage maps as the output. This eliminates the need for manual georeferencing of images. Our method incorporates simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) for segmenting the images into uniform superpixels and extraction of 62 features for each superpixel. We used various classifiers of which Random Forest classifier was found to give a comparatively high accuracy of 90.4% over others. To enumerate the accuracy of the method proposed, we used 1500 data regions of which 20% were used for testing, and 80% were used for training. The aerial images taken by GeoEye1 after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami are utilized in this study to detect building damage. In the case of availability of ground truth, we compare the histograms of the pre- and post-imagery to quantify similarity as the SSD (Sum of Squared Distances) value and thus, our approach produces an assessment as an output map displaying the extent of damage in the area covered by each superpixel. We consider 6 levels of damage ranging from 1 to 6, where 1 signifies no damage, and 6, maximum damage. © 2017 IEEE.",Damage Assessment; Image Processing; Random Forest Classifier; Segmentation; Texture Features,Antennas; Decision trees; Disasters; Earthquakes; Image processing; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Losses; Pixels; Satellite imagery; Superpixels; Tsunamis; 2011 Christchurch earthquakes; Corresponding control points; Damage assessments; Damage Identification; Devastating effects; Random forest classifier; Simple Linear Iterative Clustering; Texture features; Damage detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"GHTC - IEEE Glob.

Various edge detection techniques are obtained like Sobel, PSO Preweitt, Laplacian and Laplacian of Gaussian. These techniques consume some restrictions such as fixed edge thickness and some parameter like threshold is problematic to implement. Although many different edge-detection methods have been proposed for gray-scale, color, and multispectral images, they still face difficulties when extracting edge features from hyperspectral images (HSIs) that contain a large number of bands with very narrow gap in the spectral domain. High performance computing (HPC) is a technique used to assemble process and analyze more quantity of remote sensing (satellite) data which needs less processing time. HPC method is used in distributed & cluster Computing, parallel computing and following satellite data analyzing & processing approaches like geo-referencing, image edge detection, image classification, image mosaicking, Morphological/neural approach and image fusion for hyperspectral satellite data. Stimulated by means of the specific clustering of theory called gravitational theory, an original edge detection process. The conservative methods include the usage of linear time invariant filters. Recognition of edge is done by these filters as a These filters recognize an edge as a sudden conversion of grey scale pixel intensity. These techniques are well recognized and computationally effective. Canny, Sobel, Robert, Kirsch, Prewitt and LOG, on idea of spatial differential filters by using local grade. Within the less time these filters process the data and are inclined to noise. But in fuzzy technique, it does not include like this restriction, by altering the rules and output parameters, it is possible to change the thickness of the edge. In this paper, a new technique is created on fuzzy logic, which is suggested for detection of edge in digital images deprived of finding the threshold value. This method starts through segmenting the images into sections by means of fluctuating 3 (Formula presented.) 3 binary matrixes. The pixels of edge are planned to a range of standards separated from each other. The results of this proposed technique is compared with the results obtained from PSO and neural network methods. This suggested technique provides a permanent effect in the lines smoothness and straightness for the straight lines and good roundness for the curved lines.

Current research efforts have primarily focused on extracting domain invariant representations or learning a mapping from one domain to the other. In this research, we propose a novel transform learning based approach termed as DeepTransformer, which learns a transformation and mapping function between the features of two domains. The proposed formulation is independent of the input information and can be applied with any existing learned or hand-crafted feature. Since the mapping function is directional in nature, we propose two variants of DeepTransformer: (i) semi-coupled and (ii) symmetrically-coupled deep transform learning. This research also uses a novel IIIT-D Composite Sketch with Age (CSA) variations database which contains sketch images of 150 subjects along with age-separated digital photos. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated on a novel application of sketch-to-sketch matching, along with sketch-to-digital photo matching. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed models in comparison to existing state-of-the-art sketch matching algorithms and a commercial face recognition system. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer graphics; Computer vision; Face recognition; Image matching; Image processing; Mapping; Different domains; Face recognition systems; Invariant representation; Learning-based approach; Mapping functions; Matching algorithm; Novel applications; State of the art; Deep learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15505499,9.78154E+12,PICVE,,English,Proc IEEE Int Conf Comput Vision,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041916438

So in the proposed system, we rearrange all the pixels of the original and the enveloped image using prime and non-prime positions of the pixels. Again we reposition all the pixels using one of the user defined pixel repositioning algorithms (PRONE (positional reverse odd normal even), PRENO (positional reverse even normal odd), CRENO (continuous reverse even normal odd), CRONE (continuous reverse odd normal even)) chosen by the user for original and enveloped image separately. Lastly we perform user defined BWMAS operation (Bitwise Masking & Alternate Sequence) between the bits of original image and the least significant bits of the enveloped image. As all the pixels of both enveloped and original images are repositioned, so the pixels from original image are chosen actually in non sequential manner and the pixels, taken from enveloped image for BWMAS operation are also in non sequential manner. Only the proper sequences of the encrypted pixels defined by the user defined algorithms are being able to retrieve the information of the original image.

The encryption technique is very sensitive to the input 256 bits key and input plane image. Initially, the color image is split into three different channels R, G, and B. Next each channel is encrypted separately by employing diffusion and confusion mechanism. Finally, all three channels R, G, and B are combined to produce the required encrypted image.

The effective image retrieval process is the need and number of computations along with the rate of retrieval should be less and high respectively. Thus a simple function using cumulative distribution function is involved in the retrieval process. In this work, we propose a new method to determine similar images from large database with the use of shape feature. The Morphological processing is applied to an image to get shape feature i.e. boundary of the image. For the boundary extracted image a simple basic cumulative distribution function is applied and it results in similar intensity distribution for an image. The similarity measurement is performed using Euclidean distance. The retrieval process is compared with shape extracted feature, CDF applied feature and with edge detection algorithms.

In general, fMRI records a combination of neural activation signals and several other noisy components. Alternatively, fMRI data is represented as a high dimensional array using a number of voxels, time instants, and snapshots. The organisation of fMRI data includes a number of Region Of Interests (ROI), snapshots, and thousand of voxels. The crucial step in cognitive task classification is a reduction of feature size through feature selection. Extraction of a specific pattern of interest within the noisy components is a challenging task. Tensor decomposition techniques have found several applications in the scientific fields. In this paper, a novel tensor gradient-based feature extraction technique for cognitive task classification is proposed. The technique has efficiently been applied on StarPlus fMRI data. Also, the technique has been used to discriminate the ROIs in fMRI data in terms of cognitive state classification.

Visual video tracking includes object detection and tracking which are closely related process. Object detection involves verifying the presence of object and object tracking is monitoring object's spatial and temporal changes in images sequences. A major challenge in object tracking is the occlusion of the target object by other objects in the scene. In this paper we have proposed an automatic object tracking system to track occluded and Non-occluded object in the videos using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and Kalman filter. The objects in the image sequences can be identified with the help of invariant features extracted using SIFT algorithm. SIFT algorithm exhibits poor performance in the event of occlusion. However the occluded objects can be tracked using Kalman filter since Kalman filter optimally estimates the position of the object in the current frame using the information obtained from the previous frame. The performance of our method is evaluated using videos captured using webcam, downloaded videos from the web and some videos from visual tracker Benchmark dataset and we have achieved better recall and precision for the proposed tracking system than SIFT based tracking system. © 2017 IEEE.",Kalman filter; Object tracking; Occlusion; SIFT,Bandpass filters; Benchmarking; Image processing; Kalman filters; Object detection; Tracking (position); Object detection and tracking; Object Tracking; Occlusion; Recall and precision; Scale invariant feature transforms; SIFT; Spatial and temporal changes; Visual object tracking; Object recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044203102

Given a multi-objective function and the pixel-based hyperspectral image fusion method, the optimization process is described as finding the optimal fusion parameters to improve the fusion performance. Accordingly, an iterative-based approach is adopted. In the first step, the fusion process is developed using the pixel-based fusion technique. In the second step, the fused image is produced, and the fusion quality is assessed for multi-objective function construction. For multi-objective formulation, we focus three desired properties of the fused image such as entropy, variance, and smoothness. In the last step, fusion parameters are updated iteratively by examining the objective function. Here, the self-adaptive learning particle swarm optimizer is used to refine the fusion parameters iteratively. Different hyperspectral images, such as Cuprite mining, AVIRIS Indian pines scene, are employed in the evaluation. Quantitative analysis of fused images is carried out through some efficient fusion metrics such as correlation coefficient, entropy, Q-average, ERGAS, SAM, and SID.

In order to accurately recognize the hyperbola signatures, a novel approach called a Distinctive Similarity Rendering Approach (DSRA) is applied to GPR images. This approach includes five steps. First, the GPR B-scan image is pre-processed by pattern profile method to extract the symmetrical open curves for cone presence. Second, the detected open cone curve components were enhanced by target focussing technique to build the close cone curve signatures to result the best hyperbola signature fit. Third, the processed GPR B-scan image results the best fit hyperbola signatures, these signatures are further processed using our proposed similarity rendering approach, to reconstitute the further hyperbola apices and for the detection of all hyperbola signatures in GPR B-scan image. Fourth, then we use sample hyperbola shape signatures with varying hyperbola cone radius (Cr) to locate the hyperbola apices from the spurious reflections of all hyperbola region of interest detected. To find the hyperbola apices, a Hough transform is used in the similarity rendering area. Finally, we estimate all the hyperbola shape signatures of target object reflections. In terms of hyperbola apices reconstitution, the proposed approach exhibits better performance, as shown in experimental result explanation. © 2017 IEEE.",cone radius; Hough transform; hyperbola apices; reconstitute; rendering approach,Ground penetrating radar systems; Hough transforms; Image processing; Image segmentation; Radar imaging; Curve signatures; Ground Penetration Radar; hyperbola apices; reconstitute; Region of interest; Rendering approach; Shape signatures; Spurious reflections; Rendering (computer graphics),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044221174

The use of Dental x-ray images has achieved an extraordinary change in clinical finding because of its prompt accessibility and generally lesser radiation measurement. Orthopantomograms(OPG) or Panoramic Imaging is one of the imaging methodology as often as possible utilized as a part of dentistry to identify any dental inconsistency. Be that as it may, the dental panoramic pictures experience the ill effects of fluctuating superimposition of part of anatomical structures and have a characteristic specialized issue which prompts parcel of equivocalness when connected as a guide to finding.

To overcome these challenges in the context of wideband sensing, this paper proposes a spectrum sensing algorithm, inspired from edge detection techniques used in image processing. It is an improved, detailed and extended version of the gradient based method reported earlier (Koley et al. IEEE Communications Letters 19, 391–394, 2015). It is characterized by (i) histogram based noise power estimation for dynamic threshold computation (ii) preprocessing to obtain high detection probability with fewer numbers of samples and (iii) use of edge values as decision metric. Monte Carlo simulations as well as real-time wideband-sensed data captured through a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

It can start in the breast and can spread to other areas of the body in the course of time. Breast cancer is the second largest disease leading to the death of women. The disease is curable if detected early enough. A lot of research is being done to detect the cancer at the earliest. Early detection at the microcalcification stage can be useful for providing proper treatment at the early stage and saving the patients. Research on breast cancer using digital image processing is not new but lack of proper methods for early detection at microcalcification stage is still a challenge to medical domain and still it is considered as the deadliest. Most of the research work done till now detects the breast cancer at tumor stage and are not accurate to 100% and leads to false positive or false negative results which are highly dangerous. And also they do not provide end to end solution. A novel methodology is proposed in this paper to detect breast asymmetry and microcalcification cancer cells using a combination of different highly efficient techniques of digital image processing which are not yet being implemented in this research area. Using the methodology proposed in this paper it is possible to detect the breast cancer at a very early microcalcification stage itself and the result of this proposed methodology will be of very high accuracy leading to true positive and true negative results. The methodology proposed in this paper provides end to end solution. © 2017 IEEE.,Bayes Classifier; Dilation; Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix; K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier; Otsu's thresholding algorithm; Sobel Edge Detection Mask,Calcification (biochemistry); Cells; Diseases; Edge detection; Medical imaging; Nearest neighbor search; Patient treatment; Bayes Classifier; Dilation; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Sobel edge detection; Thresholding algorithms; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The popularity and need of video surveillance at residential, Industrial, public and business locations have supported the widespread use of vision based fire detection system. The colour of fire is the basic technique for identification of fire in an image. However, the colour of fire varies from red, orange, yellow to white. Also, there are non-fire objects with fire-like colour. In order to improve the accuracy of fire detection system, colour detection is combined with various other techniques. Edge detection, motion detection, area covered by flames, existence of smoke, growth of fire and background segmentation are some techniques which are combined by various researchers and used to correctly classify the fire images and fire-like non fire images in a video. There are also various thresholds that are used to differentiate fire in any frame. These thresholds need to be adjusted based on the type of area and its brightness level. Also, the difference in the subsequent frames and area covered by the flames supports the existence of fire if it is greater than the threshold. This paper presents the comparative analysis of five recent vision based fire detection system. These fire detection systems are based on flame colour detection combined with other features such as motion and area of frame.

We adopted many technologies to identify these diseases like image processing, artificial neural network, data mining etc. Now a day's image processing is most effective for detection of these kinds of skin diseases. It uses different techniques to identify the part affected by disease like feature extraction, filtering, image pre-processing, image segmentation etc. It also identifies the affected areas color as well as the form of affected area.

An average of seventeen minutes and considerable amount of fuel is wasted in an effort to find a parking spot every time. Additional stress is induced due to parking hassles starting from finding an empty parking spot to relocating the car later. We propose a system leveraging the latest technologies that will help motorists overcome their parking problems and at the same time, make managing a parking space easier and cost effective by automating the entire process right from pre-booking a parking slot to making the payment. Since most of the parking spaces are equipped with CCTV surveillance cameras, we intend to use them to detect the presence of cars and measure the availability of parking spots within a parking space using techniques like image processing and machine learning. In order to test the performance of the proposed system, a prototype of the system is built that mimics the working of an actual parking space excluding minute details. A prototype of the application is built that would aid the user in booking the slot and guide him/her back to the allocated parking slot.

Images are extensively used in communications on due of various facts. But image security in communication remains an essential aim. Coloration in images are originated by different color models, which are discussed with their actual potentials. In this paper, different image usage and protecting practices are discussed with their annoyances. There exists multiple protecting methods, in general called as encryption. In complex image encryption algorithms the logical operations such as ExOR, carries trivial but an essential part. While being a powerful operator, ExOR is also very less in terms of time and space complexity. In this paper, Textimage Ciphering algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm gives the finest probable combination of all discussed techniques. Also it has less time and space complexity which makes it more practicable. The suggested tactic is different from traditional protecting techniques, it advocates encoding of an image by transforming it in text form. The encoded text is then send and on receiver side, its first decoded then converted to image form which resemblance the original image. The rationality of image to text is expressed in detailed manner with clarification of each and every stage along with flowchart and programming details. © 2017 IEEE.",BigInteger; color models; ExOR; Textimage; watermarking,Color codes; Cryptography; Digital watermarking; Indium compounds; BigInteger; Color models; ExOR; Logical operations; Original images; Protecting method; Textimage; Time and space complexity; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This is because of its wide applicability found in many areas including medical, science, security, Bioinformatics and entertainments. It has emerged as one of the growing field of research in engineering and the sciences. CBIR system searches large image database based on the contents of the images. The recent work carried out in this field is focused to achieve efficiency and accuracy in the image retrieval process. The major limitations encountered during review of the literature are an effective representation of image by extracting visual contents, mismatches found due to semantic gap between image representation and user's interpretation of the image and high dimensional feature vectors. This paper mainly focuses on two problems, feature extraction techniques to effectively represent the image and semantic gap. To attenuate the problems identified, the paper presents a proposal of the novel framework to optimize Content Based Image Retrieval system using Differential Evolution approach. In addition, it presents the concept of relevance feedback to reduce the semantic gap to improve the result.

In order to provide improved prognostic decision, there is an urgent need of developing not only reliable but also a rapid IHC quantifier. In view of this, our study aims at developing an automated IHC profiler for quantitative assessment of ER, PR and Ki-67 molecular expression from stained tissue images.

This growth is more noticeable in the case of herbicides, which present an undeniable benefit in food production, providing larger and more stable production. However, the application of these products in an improper and careless way carries possible toxic risks to health and the environment, if too high, or its effectiveness may be reduced, if too low. This need of controlled application raises the issue of the measurement of the distribution of the chemicals as they are being applied. One of the most used resources for this task is the hydrosensitive card (HC), which proved to be an effective tool for the analysis of the 'quality of application' of agrochemicals in a field. The efficiency of these cards depends strongly on a precise readout of the shape, quantity and distribution of the droplets that hit the card, when placed on the application area. Much work is actually devoted to this task, but most of the tools are not available for field work, and the few ones that are available are not customizable. In this work we developed an algorithm for the lecture and analysis of hydrosensitive cards. It detect automatically the drops, determines the quality of the card, and measures several statistical quantitative parameters, useful for the control of the method and quantity of application. © 2017 Comisión Permanente RPIC.",agrochemicals; hydrosensitive card; image processing,Agricultural chemicals; Drops; Health risks; Image processing; agrochemicals; Application area; Customizable; Effective tool; Food production; hydrosensitive card; Quantitative parameters; Risks to health; Quality control,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78988E+12,,,English,"Workshop Inf.

In past, Identity of a person verified by traditional token-based or knowledge-based system but in recent year's bio-metrics traits like face, finger, iris, palm print etc. become a key technology for identity verification. Palm print is also the one bio-metric trait that can be used for the efficient identification. Palm print contains many unique features like principal lines, points, ridges, textures etc. that can differentiate two person. Because palm is a large area of hand, there is a common problem of palm displacement over scanner that results in increase in false rejection rate. This paper proposed a method which first generates ROI of captured palm image then median filtering is applied to remove noise and increasing edge sharpness. Histogram equalization applied after that for contrast stretching for low resolution images. Enhanced image is then divided in sixteen equal part, texture feature is extracted from each part of image separately using different orientations of Gabor filter. The generated feature vectors of all sixteen images are then normalized to a single feature vector using n bin histogram process. This increase acceptance rate in case if palm is placed over scanner in slightly different angles because working on small areas of palm helps to extract detail features.

Finally, these points are sorted and the desire permutation is obtained. The circle is defined by using a secret value 'r' as radius, the points are selected at distance 'd' (either in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction) and in the sorting method two options have used: i) which one will be primary key; ii) ascending or descending order.

During the embedding process, SVD has been applied to the coefficient blocks to get the singular values in the IWT domain. Singular values are modulated to embed the watermark in the host image. Online sequential extreme learning machine is trained to learn the relationship between the original coefficient and the corresponding watermarked version. During the extraction process, this trained OSELM is used to extract the embedded watermark logo blindly as no original host image is required during this process.

Generally, the underwater images are whisked by blurring effect, scattering effect etc. because of poor lighting condition. EMD is a signal decompose algorithm which is particularly useful for non-stationary and non-linear signals. First of all, the image is processed through the Gray World technique which is a white balance approach to enhance the contrast of the image and to remove the unwanted color cast in the image. Then, each R, G and B channel of the resultant image is decomposed into its Intrinsic Mode Functions(IMFs). Final enhanced image has been constructed by combining the IMFs of each channel with different optimised weights. The EMD algorithm is implemented on the resultant image of White balanced process to restore the color. Our experimental results enhance the contrast of the image by reducing noise as well as artifacts in the image. To show the quantitative enhanced result, Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix(GLCM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Mean Square Error(MSE) are calculated and compared with different conventional enhancement methods.

It can be used to promote security in urban areas and to increase the quality of life. Street light also provides safety for drivers, riders and pedestrians. In this paper, a machine vision system is proposed to identify the variations in the lighting of the road. The objective of this paper is to monitor the variations in the average intensity of the light on the road. The video data was acquired of night time road conditions and frames were extracted from video data. Several image processing techniques such as adaptive histogram equalization and morphological operations were performed on the images and the average intensity of the street light on each frame was computed. In this study, the variation in average intensity values are found to be useful in identifying the low lighting conditions on the road. The preliminary results clearly indicate the variations in the light falling on the road during night time. © 2017 IEEE.",Adaptive histogram equalization; Machine Vision; Mathematical Morphology; Street Light,Computer vision; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image processing; Lighting; Mathematical morphology; Pedestrian safety; Street lighting; Transportation; Video recording; Adaptive histogram equalization; Image processing technique; Intensity values; Lighting conditions; Machine vision systems; Morphological operations; Poor visibility; Quality of life; Roads and streets,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The paper deals with reducing the locomotive accidents by creating a continuous monitoring and Warning System which detects the obstacle even before encountering it and collects all the related information about it. It also specifies about the hybrid technology which makes use of renewable energy to meet the electricity needs within the train.Two separate blocks are required. One will be employed for the purpose of protection of the train, which includes the image processing methodology. The second one will be employed for conserving the electrical energy, which uses the excess or unwanted by-products from the motion of the train, that is recycled with the help of several sensors to produce electricity. Each block is separately controlled by its own Microcontroller. This paper deals with image processing technique in which cameras are placed throughout the track which captures image when any motion is detected. Once if it is detected, the system will send an auto generated mail to loco driver so as to intimate him about the obstacle in order to prevent the accidents. Also the paper deals with generation of electricity using three different sources. Firstly, a Peltier sensor is used, which uses heat liberated from the engine. Secondly, a Piezo Electric crystal is placed on the wheels, which uses the mechanical vibrations and finally, Solar panels are fixed over the train's roof which uses light Energy from the sun. The entire power harvested will be fed into a booster which multiplies it several times and the output is stored in a battery.

Chaos based encryption systems are preferred for digital image encryption for a long time now. For a reliable encryption method any alteration in image content or the key must be reflected in the cipher image. The present work demonstrates a highly secure and reliable encryption of the color images using chaotic dynamical system augmented by pixel shuffling based on 3-D matrix, and further subjected to a diffusion process. This proposed model yields an average NPCR and UACI values of ? 99.6% and ? 33.34% respectively and nearly no correlation among neighbouring pixels which indicates a higher immunity towards attacks. The proposed model ensures information integrity during transmission which was further validated with a series of simulations e.g. entropy, noise addition, tampering and compression. Further, statistical analysis was also carried out using histogram analysis for different types of attacks. The model shows its prominence in scenarios where the transmission of image based sensitive information is critical. © 2017 IEEE.",3-D Matrix; Color Image Encryption; Diffusion; Logistic Map; Shuffling,Diffusion; Dynamical systems; Image processing; Pixels; Chaotic dynamical systems; Color image encryptions; Digital image encryption; Encryption technique; Information integrity; Logistic maps; Sensitive informations; Shuffling; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To minimize these challenges, cryptographic concepts has been introduced. Cryptography is the art of technique that is used to changing the information in to unreadable format based on the user's key. Various cryptographic concepts have been introduced for text and image. Due to data redundancy and mass data capacity the text encryption methods are difficult to handle the image encryption. Image encryption is done by changing the position of the pixels in an image based on the key provided by the user. In the existing method, the image encryption is done by the magic rectangle method. It contains only one magic rectangle and if it is computed, the intruder can easily retrieve the original image. To overcome this, we proposed the Pan Magic Square encryption algorithm for the image to be encrypted. In PMS, the plain text image is partitioned into pixels. By user's key, 64 magic squares are generated. Then, encrypt the image based on the square values. The image is being encrypted by the PMS algorithm. The encrypted image is transmitted to the receiver. The receiver will decrypt the image by the reverse process of the encryption. The encrypted image provided by the algorithm is different from the plaintext image so we can securely transmit over the internet. After decryption, the resulting image provided by the proposed technique will be same as the original plaintext image. © 2017 IEEE.",Decryption; Encryption; Magic Square; permutation,Image processing; Number theory; Pixels; Cryptographic concepts; Decryption; Encrypted images; Encryption algorithms; Image encryptions; Magic square; permutation; Text encryptions; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

These transforms finds application in compression, enhancement, pattern recognition, and feature extraction etc. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a widely used wavelet transformation. DWT transforms image from space domain to frequency domain, where the wavelets are discretely sampled. DWT has various advantages over other image transforms such as image can be represented in multi resolution form, avoids the division of image into non-overlapping blocks, blocking artifacts are avoided to achieve a high compression ratio, better identification of data suitable for human perception, provides better localization in spatial and frequency domain. DWT implemented on software [Matlab] usually has lower throughput, which is due to high overall design cycle time. This can be improved through hardware implementation of DWT. In this paper an effective high speed DWT architecture has been designed using Distributed Arithmetic (DA) concept. The designed architecture has been simulated and synthesized by using Verilog HDL for the selected device ZYNQZC706 (7z045ffg900-2).

So, in these days just by looking a digital image we cannot say whether it is a genuine or not. This is why digital image authentication, as well as restoration, has become the essential issues, especially when it is utilized in medical science, evidence of court, and forensic science. This paper proposes an effective self-embedding fragile watermarking technique for the digital image authentication as well as recovery. The watermark is generated by quantization, and block truncation coding (BTC) of each 2 × 2 non-overlapping block and embedded in three least significant bits (LSBs) of the corresponding mapped block. The recovery bits are derived from most significant bits (MSBs) of the host image, and the authentication bits are derived from recovery bits, the spatial location of pixels and watermark keys. Even if tempering rate is 50%, the reconstruction of tampered image is achieved with high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized correlation coefficient (NCC). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only outperforms high-quality recovery fidelity but also negotiate the blocking artifacts additionally it improves the accuracy of tamper localization due to the use of very small size blocks. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Block truncation coding; Digital image watermarking; Image authentication; Image restoration; Self-embedding watermarking,Authentication; Codes (symbols); Digital devices; Digital forensics; Digital image storage; Digital watermarking; Forensic science; Image coding; Image reconstruction; Image watermarking; Medical imaging; Recovery; Restoration; Signal to noise ratio; Watermarking; Block truncation coding; Digital image watermarking; Image authentication; Least significant bits; Normalized correlation coefficient; Peak signal to noise ratio; Recovery capabilities; Self embedding; Image processing,"Singh, D.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology(BHU)India; email: durgeshcse@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037657378

This process results in improved quality of digital and gray scale images with higher PSNR for compression. Next, wavelet quantization transformation based image compression algorithm is developed in MWT-ICD Technique using Morlet’s wavelet transformation. Finally, quantized wavelet transformation based image decompression process is carried out in MWT-ICD technique with the objective of obtaining the reconstructed original image.

Encryption of images is one of the well known mechanisms to preserve confidentiality of images over a reliable unrestricted public media. This medium is vulnerable to attacks and hence efficient encryption algorithms are necessity for secure data transfer. Various techniques have been proposed in literature till date, each have an edge over the other, to catch-up to the ever growing need of security. This paper is an effort to compare the most popular techniques available on the basis of various performance metrics like differential, statistical and quantitative attacks analysis. To measure the efficacy, all the modern and grown-up techniques are implemented in MATLAB-2015. The results show that the chaotic schemes used in the study provide highly scrambled encrypted images having uniform histogram distribution. In addition, the encrypted images provided very less degree of correlation coefficient values in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions, proving their resistance against statistical attacks. In addition, these schemes are able to resist differential attacks as these showed a high sensitivity for the initial conditions, i.e. pixel and key values. Finally, the schemes provide a large key spacing, hence can resist the brute force attacks, and provided a very less computational time for image encryption/decryption in comparison to other schemes available in literature. © 2017, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Chaotic function; Cryptography; Differential attacks; Encryption/decryption; S-box; Statistical attacks,Data transfer; Image processing; Screen printing; Security of data; Chaotic functions; Differential attacks; Encryption/decryption; S-box; Statistical attacks; Cryptography,"Gupta, S.; YMCA University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: shailender81@gmail.com",,3D Display Research Center,20926731,,,,English,3D Res.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034656981

The identification of individual cattle is an important issue for classification of different breads, their registration, traceability, health management, and verification of false insurance claim throughout the world. To solve these major problems, the muzzle (nose) point image pattern of cattle is a suitable and primary biometric characteristic for the recognition of cattle. The recognition of muzzle point images is similar to the recognition of minutiae points in the human fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature extraction approach for the automatic recognition and classification of cattle breeds based on captured muzzle point image pattern features using low- cost camera. The major contributions of this research is based on following aspects: (1) preparation of muzzle point image dataset, (2) extraction of salient set of features and (3) K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), Fuzzy-KNN, Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes classification models are applied to recognition, and classification of individual cattle using their muzzle point pattern. This paper, therefore, demonstrates the automatic recognition and classification of livestock using the set of extracted muzzle point image features.

Accurate motion states estimation and the target representation in visual tracking system are based on the appearances of the target. The factor affects the learning of target representation is the accumulated error due to the pose, illumination changes, and the uneven background. The presence of dynamic background and the shadowing effects causes the visual drift and destructive information. Besides, the misclassification of target region induces the false detection of moving objects. The K-means and Fuzzy-C-means clustering algorithms are available to segment the foreground/background and suppress the shadow region on the basis of the non-changing background of the surveillance area. This paper proposes the novel background normalization technique with textural pattern analysis to suppress the shadow region. The Neighborhood Chain Prediction (NCP) algorithm is used to cluster the uneven background and the Differential Boundary Pattern (DBP) extracts the texture of the video frame to suppress the shadow pixels present in the frame. The lower intensity estimation and the prediction of the area around the lower intensity in proposed work enhance the pixels for shadow removal. The shadow-free frame split up into several grids and the histograms of features are extracted from the grid formatted frame. Finally, the Machine Level Classification (MLC) finds the matching grid corresponds to the tracking region and provides the binary labeling to separate the background and foreground. The proposed DBP-based visual tracking system is high robustness over the sudden illumination changes and the dynamic background due to the texture pattern analysis.

Also with the increased data traffic, it is hard to transmit the entire bulky medical data. New methods have come into the scene to reduce the traffic while maintaining the sufficient level of security. Partial encryption is one of the methods which selectively encrypt the bulky medical image. Meanwhile, if the same medical image is needed to be reused for another diagnosis, then it is recommended to protect the entire medical image. This paper proposes a hybrid encryption scheme based on deoxyribo nucleic acid and chaotic maps, which can be adaptable for both selective and full medical image encryption. The proposed algorithm uses multiple chaotic maps in single process to generate the highly random keys for encrypting the color digital imaging and communications in medicine image. The algorithm comprises three phases, namely, permutation, encoding, and diffusion. In all the phases, the selection of specific rule set depends on the key sequences produced from the combined chaotic system.

However, existing methods suffer with the challenge of greater artifacts at high acceleration factors. This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI collection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed method based on l1?l1 norm constraints, wherein we impose first l1-norm sparsity on the voxel time series (temporal data) in the transformed domain and the second l1-norm sparsity on the successive difference of the same temporal data. Hence, we name the proposed method as Double Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly evaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data. Results are presented at various acceleration factors. Quantitative analysis in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative analysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs) demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the proposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying fMRI data. Compared to the existing methods, the DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10-12 dB in PSNR with acceleration factors upto 3.5 on resting state fMRI data. Simulation results on real data demonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with accurate detection of RSNs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Accelerated functional MRI; Compressed sensing; k-t acceleration; l1 minimization; Sparse recovery; Undersampling,"Compressed sensing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Acceleration factors; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Functional MRI; Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Qualitative analysis; Reconstruction method; Sparse recovery; Under-sampling; Signal to noise ratio; acceleration; Article; artifact; brain size; brain slice; connectome; controlled study; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human tissue; measurement; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality control; quantitative analysis; resting state network; signal noise ratio; adolescent; adult; algorithm; brain; diagnostic imaging; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; signal processing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult","Aggarwal, P.; Signal Processing and Bio-medical Imaging Lab, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT)India; email: priyaa@iiitd.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,29101794,English,Comput.

Recent trend of miniaturization in mini/micro fluid reactors, compact heat exchangers and micro thrusters requires a thorough knowledge on multiphase flow phenomena in mini/micro channels. The present work is focused on the effect irradiation behavior of infrared rays (IR) during gas liquid two phase flow consisting of thin liquid films inside a mini channel. The influence of size and shape of the slug regime and liquid film thickness on IR rays is analyzed with COMSOL Multi physics package. Experiments are carried out in a 2.5 mm diameter borosilicate glass tube with wall thickness of 0.3 mm. The refraction and transmittance behavior of IR rays on slug and bubbly flow is studied by analyzing the Current-time output of an IR photodiode kept at different angles with the test section. The results are found to be in good agreement with experimental image processing technique and COMSOL results. The results obtained will be useful for designing of IR sensor arrays sensitive to multiphase flows.

Image enhancement algorithms focus on improving the human image perception. More specifically, contrast and brightness enhancement is considered as a key processing step prior to any further image analysis like segmentation, feature extraction, etc. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are used effectively for the past few decades, for solving such complex image processing problems. In this paper, a modified differential Modified Differential Evolution (MDE) algorithm for contrast and brightness enhancement of satellite images is proposed. The proposed algorithm is developed with exploration phase by differential evolution algorithm and exploitation phase by cuckoo search algorithm. The proposed algorithm is used to maximize a defined fitness function so as to enhance the entropy, standard deviation and edge details of an image by adjusting a set of parameters to remodel a global transformation function subjective to each of the image being processed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with ten recent state-of-the-art enhancement algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm in enhancing satellite images and natural scenes effectively. Objective evaluation of the compared methods was done using several full-reference and no-reference performance metrics.

The widespread popularity of imagery applications and the advent of powerful and inexpensive cameras are among the numerous reasons that have contributed to this upward spike in the reach of image manipulation. A considerable number of features – including numerous texture features – have been proposed by various researchers for identifying image forgery. However, detecting forgery in images utilizing texture-based features have not been explored to its full potential – especially a thorough evaluation of the texture features have not been proposed. In this paper, features based on image textures are extracted and combined in a specific way to detect the presence of image forgery. First, the input image is converted to YCbCr color space to extract the chroma channels. Gabor Wavelets and Local Phase Quantization are subsequently applied to these channels to extract the texture features at different scales and orientations. These features are then optimized using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This method leads to the classification of images with accuracies of 99.33%, 96.3%, 97.6%, 85%, and 96.36% for the CASIA v2.0, CASIA v1.0, CUISDE, IFS-TC and Unisa TIDE datasets respectively showcasing its ability to identify image forgeries under varying conditions. With CASIA v2.0, the detection accuracy outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods, and with the other datasets, it gives a comparable performance with much reduced feature dimensions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Gabor wavelets; Image forensics; Local phase quantization; Non-negative matrix factorization; Support vector machine,Classification (of information); Factorization; Feature extraction; Forensic engineering; Image compression; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Support vector machines; Vector quantization; Detection accuracy; Feature dimensions; Gabor wavelets; Image forensics; Image forgery detections; Local phase quantizations; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Ycbcr color spaces; Image texture,"Isaac, M.M.; Department of Computer Science, University of Kerala, Kariavattom, India; email: meerathu@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031422294

The reconstruction algorithms proposed in the compressive sensing literature try to iteratively reconstruct the full image. Hence, those are computationally expensive. If some prior knowledge of the object is available, then a closed-form reconstruction algorithm can be formulated. The goal is to reconstruct the object of interest efficiently without being bothered about the quality of reconstruction of the scene. To address this situation, a constraint is formulated and incorporated into linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator to form a closed-form solution. This compact solution is capable of meaningfully reconstructing the object relative to the scene. In the proposed method, an illconditioned matrix inversion problem has been faced and overcome by regularization method. To boost the speed of the algorithm, a modified Euler method is proposed for finding the regularization parameter. To further speedup the reconstruction process, larger images are divided into several pieces and each piece is reconstructed separately using constrained LMMSE. For a given number of measurements, the simulation-based results demonstrate acceptable quality of reconstruction with minimal computational effort. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,Compressed sensing; Image reconstruction; Iterative methods; Mean square error; Security systems; Signal receivers; Closed form solutions; Ill-conditioned matrices; Linear minimum mean square error(LMMSE); Modified Euler method; Reconstruction algorithms; Reconstruction process; Regularization methods; Regularization parameters; Image processing,"Tripathy, S.R.; School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology BhubaneswarIndia; email: st11@iitbbs.ac.in",,Institution of Engineering and Technology,17519675,,,,English,IET Signal Proc.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039987837

The encryption scheme uses a random amplitude mask in the spatial domain and a random phase mask in the frequency domain. Its inputs are phase-images, which are relatively more secure as compared to the intensity images because of non-linearity. The proposed scheme further derives its strength from the use of 3D-Lorenz transform in the frequency domain. Although the experimental setup for optical realization of the proposed scheme has been provided, the results presented here are based on simulations on MATLAB. It has been validated for grayscale images, and is found to be sensitive to the encryption parameters of the Lorenz system. The attacks analysis shows that the key-space is large enough to resist brute-force attack, and the scheme is also resistant to the noise and occlusion attacks.

In this security system, we have proposed an algorithm for encryption and decryption of RGB images by using chaotic system based scrambling combined with reality preserving two dimensional discrete fractional Fourier transform (RP2DFRFT) and Arnold transform (AT). Earlier developed security system for RGB image data provides only one layer of protection either in time domain or in frequency domain. But presented cryptosystem provides multi-layer security for RGB image in time as well as in frequency domain with no loss of any information of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) components. The algorithms of existing techniques for the security of color images are mostly based on keys, but the proposed cryptosystem provides security of color images on the basis of the keys as well as the arrangement of used algorithms and parameters. Additionally, the use of reality preserving method not just eliminates the complexity of dealing with imaginary data, but it also enhances the efficiency of the technique by reducing the domain space to its half, at least for all the calculations involved in two dimensional DFRFT. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed technique represents that the encryption keys are very sensitive. Results on standard examples and their security and statistical analysis for color images are testimony to the robustness and appropriateness of the presented technique.

Each peripheral centre manages its’ own health-care service independently and communicates with the central server for remote assistance. The proposed methodology for automated evaluation of parasites includes pre-processing of blood smear microscopic images followed by erythrocytes segmentation. To differentiate between different parasites; a total of 138 quantitative features characterising colour, morphology, and texture are extracted from segmented erythrocytes. An integrated pattern classification framework is designed where four feature selection methods viz. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Chi-square, Information Gain, and RELIEF are employed with three different classifiers i.e. Naive Bayes’, C4.5, and Instance-Based Learning (IB1) individually. Optimal features subset with the best classifier is selected for achieving maximum diagnostic precision. It is seen that the proposed method achieved with 99.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity by combining CFS and C4.5 in comparison with other methods.

In many situations, collection of field data from remote places is difficult due to inaccessibility of landslide area. This paper examines landslide susceptibility in the Bukit Antarabangsa, Kuala Lumpur, to ease geographical studies, using image processing and multivariate statistical tools by reviewing the digital images using remote-sensing technique without any physical survey. We considered different pixel resolutions and report the effectiveness of using factor analysis, principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and their hybridization. Eight types of databases for heavy, medium, and no landslide were created. The modeling works were carried out at 2 × 2, 4 × 4, 8 × 8, 16 × 16, 32 × 32, 64 × 64, 128 × 128, and 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. Results indicate 2 × 2 was optimal in both heavy and medium while 8 × 8 found to be ideal for no landslide region. Performance at different pixel resolutions was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and average success of 87.36% was found.

This developing multifaceted nature, over a timeframe, has influenced the general responsiveness and battery life of the robot. From controlling a drone to an internet controlled coffee maker, an on-board processor for the calculation of all control signs is required for setting off a reaction to the stimuli. At the point when the unpredictability of the embedded system rises, more convoluted computation is required to react to those inputs. This has not only reduced the general responsiveness and battery life of the robot but also has additionally prompted the need of overhauling the equipment to suit the upsurge in the calculation required. The solution to this problem is by offloading the critical tasks like control signal computation or image processing to a centralized server which would eliminate the requirement of complex on-board processors. A comprehensive analysis is presented on the feasibility of such code offloading in embedded robotic systems and its applicability to other domains is discussed.

The proposed restoration technique consists of two stages: noisy pixel identification and restoration. Center sliding window is considered as current processing pixel for both noisy pixel identification and restoration. In the first stage of the proposed technique, we follow an absolute directional difference of the neighborhood pixels to identify the pixels those are affected by impulse noise. We propose an edge preserving contextual model to restore the noisy pixels. The noise correction stage of the proposed scheme depends on the context model of the noise-free pixels in the selected window. The parameters of the contextual model are obtained using a Gaussian kernel. The proposed algorithm is tested on nine benchmark test images. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm is carried out by comparing it against nine competitive state-of-the-art algorithms for impulse noise removal. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM), Non-shifted Edge Ratio (NSER) and Correlation Factor (CF) performance measures.

A 5 volt sine wave AC power supply and a rectangular parallel plate capacitor circuit are used to measure the difference in dielectric properties caused by the introduction of a red banana in between the plates. The values of properties like capacitance and relative permittivity are increased continuously whereas impedance and admittance are decreased gradually with increase in ripening stages of red banana. In image processing approach, Noise Reductant Local Binary Pattern (NRLBP), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Completed Local Binary Pattern (CLBP) based techniques are used for red banana's ripening grade determination. The processing stages involved are enhancement, Binary Pattern generation and classification. The variant Binary patterns are tested on noisy as well as noiseless condition and the results are compared. A novel enhancement technique for banana ripening grade determination is proposed based on segmentation using Tsallis entropy. Also novel idea on the automation of q parameter involved in Tsallis Entropy is implemented. The threshold parameter of the Noise Reductant Local Binary Pattern (NRLBP) varied and its effect on classification rate is studied. A new modification is proposed and implemented on NRLBP to accommodate uniform background and areas with the image.

We present SketchSoup, a workflow that allows designers to explore the design space induced by such sketches. We take an unstructured collection of drawings as input, along with a small number of user-provided correspondences as input. We register them using a multi-image matching algorithm, and present them as a 2D interpolation space. By morphing sketches in this space, our approach produces plausible visualizations of shape and viewpoint variations despite the presence of sketch distortions that would prevent standard camera calibration and 3D reconstruction. In addition, our interpolated sketches can serve as inspiration for further drawings, which feed back into the design space as additional image inputs. SketchSoup thus fills a significant gap in the early ideation stage of conceptual design by allowing designers to make better informed choices before proceeding to more expensive 3D modelling and prototyping.

Examples include diagnosis, pre/post surgery guidance, comparing/merging/integrating images from multi-modal like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Computed Tomography (CT). Whether registering images across modalities for a single patient or registering across patients for a single modality, registration is an effective way to combine information from different images into a normalized frame for reference. Registered datasets can be used for providing information relating to the structure, function, and pathology of the organ or individual being imaged. In this paper a hybrid approach for medical images registration has been developed. It employs a modified Mutual Information (MI) as a similarity metric and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. Computation of mutual information is modified using a weighted linear combination of image intensity and image gradient vector flow (GVF) intensity. In this manner, statistical as well as spatial image information is included into the image registration process. Maximization of the modified mutual information is effected using the versatile Particle Swarm Optimization which is developed easily with adjusted less parameter. The developed approach has been tested and verified successfully on a number of medical image data sets that include images with missing parts, noise contamination, and/or of different modalities (CT, MRI).

The aim of this study was to introduce a robust method that can automatically identify alcoholic EEG signals based on time–frequency (T–F) image information as they convey key characteristics of EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method to classify automatically the alcoholic and control EEG signals. The proposed scheme is based on time–frequency images, texture image feature extraction and nonnegative least squares classifier (NNLS). In T–F analysis, the spectrogram of the short-time Fourier transform is considered. The obtained T–F images are then converted into 8-bit grayscale images. Co-occurrence of the histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) and Eig(Hess)-CoHOG features are extracted from T–F images. Finally, obtained features are fed into NNLS classifier as input for classify alcoholic and control EEG signals. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we replace the NNLS classifier by artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine classifier separately, with the same features. Experimental outcomes along with comparative evaluations with the state-of-the-art algorithms manifest that the proposed method outperforms competing algorithms. The experimental outcomes are promising, and it can be anticipated that upon its implementation in clinical practice, the proposed scheme will alleviate the onus of the physicians and expedite neurological diseases diagnosis and research. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Alcoholism; Classification; Electroencephalogram; Feature extraction; Nonnegative least squares classifier; Texture image; Time–frequency images,Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Discriminant analysis; Electroencephalography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image texture; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Alcoholism; Frequency image; Histograms of oriented gradients; Linear discriminant analysis; Nonnegative least squares; Short time Fourier transforms; Support vector machine classifiers; Texture image; Biomedical signal processing,"Bajaj, V.; Discipline of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and ManufacturingIndia; email: bajajvarun056@yahoo.co.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

The video taken from the UAV is processed by further extracting image frames and analyzing each of these image frames for detection of cracks along railway line. A real-time implementation of our proposed method can significantly reduce physical labor involved in crack detection and also reduces the risk of accidents. © 2017 IEEE.",Image processing; Monte Carlo localization algorithm; UAV; Unmanned aerial vehicle,Aircraft detection; Antennas; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Image processing; Monte Carlo methods; Railroad accidents; Railroad tracks; Railroads; Real time control; Sports; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicles; Commercial applications; Disaster management; Human intervention; Monte Carlo localization; Particle filter localization; Railway track; Real-time implementations; Risk of accidents; Crack detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

But, most of the crops grown by the farmer are affected by weeds. Weed identification and control remains one of the most challenging tasks in agriculture. The most widely used methods for weed control is manual spraying of herbicides. But, this method has several negative impacts. Since hand labor is costly, an automated weed control system may be economically feasible. Although there have been many efforts to develop a system to control in-row weeds autonomously, no system is currently available for real-time field use. Further, the Onion is slowgrowing, shallow-rooted crop that can suffer severe yield loss from weed competition. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems, the proposed system aims to develop a computer vision based robotic weed control system (WCS) for real-time control of weeds in onion fields. This system will be able to identify weeds and selectively spray right amount of the herbicide. The proposed WCS is an inexpensive and portable wireless system of handheld equipments which can be controlled remotely through a user friendly web interface. It is designed to automate the control of weeds and thus reduces the difficulties of farmers in maintaining the field. The proposed system is based on a combination of image processing, machine learning and internet of things (IoT). © 2017 IEEE.","Computer Vision; Image Processing, Robotics, Neural Network; Internet of Things",Agriculture; Computer vision; Control systems; Crops; Herbicides; Image processing; Internet of things; Learning systems; Precision agriculture; Real time control; Robotics; Weed control; Hand-held equipment; Internet of Things (IOT); Shallow rooted; User friendly; Web interface; Weed competition; Weed identification; Wireless systems; Computer control systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Automatic identification of crops is one of the major applications in the field of the hyperspectral image processing. The major curbs involved in crop classification are: i) Huge dimension of the data and ii) Spectral Similarity amongst crops. This paper proposes a new method of crop classification in which fusion of spectral, spatial and vegetation indices is used as the feature set to overcome the limitation of spectral similarity problem. Here the processing is done in two stages: dimensionality reduction and supervised classification. The dimensionality reduction is done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Transform (MNF) technique and the selected dimensions are classified using Support Vector Machine Classifier. The results obtained using the proposed technique show that on integrating the vegetation indices along with the spectral and spatial features have raised the accuracy to 98.0749% and helped achieve a kappa coefficient of 0.9769. © 2017 IEEE.",Big data; Hyperspectral imaging; Minimum noise transform; Support vector machines,Automation; Classification (of information); Crops; Hyperspectral imaging; Image processing; Principal component analysis; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Automatic identification; Crop classification; Dimensionality reduction; Kappa coefficient; Spectral similarity; Supervised classification; Support vector machine classifiers; Vegetation index; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The very first step to control pollution is to detect the sources of pollution. The urban areas are more polluted than rural due to the high population density. The pollutants considered in this paper are aerosol and asbestos sheets. The source of asbestos are building roofs which are mainly in urban area and that of aerosol is combustion of coal. The conventional image processing techniques failed to detect the pollutant in urban environment which can be performed well using multispectral imaging. Since each object has different temperatures using the TIR (Thermal Infrared) bands of Landsat 8 data, the urban objects are classified using the land surface temperature map. The presence of asbestos sheets is detected by change in intensity of images with respect to Band 7 (Short Wave Infrared) and Band 9 (Cirrus).

Designing an effective fragile watermarking scheme to protect such images needs capturing both structure and information content which is an open research challenge. A novel contourlet based fragile watermarking technique for optimal detection of tampered locations, localization and recovery of handwritten document images is put forth in this paper. The original image is t subjected to Contourlets transform. The first and second level contourlet coefficients are used as watermark. The watermark is embedded intelligently into robust locations based on the significance of the contribution of the contourlet coefficients. A quantization based embedding technique is used for embedding. The tamper detection is performed by comparing the blocks of generated and extracted watermarks and component labelling technique is used to find out different tampered objects. The recovery of tampered objects is carried out using the watermarks embedded at robust locations. The proposed watermarking scheme using contourlets is compared with a popular technique using curvelets. The proposed technique outperforms in detecting tampered locations and recovery of the tampered information. This work also exhibits better efficiency in terms of PSNR values.

Reversible data hiding techniques are gaining huge importance in recent years due to its excellent feature of enabling zero distortion reconstruction of both cover medium information as well as secret data information, while protecting the confidentiality of the payload image information. We propose an algorithm where in, encrypted cover image is generated by bitwise XOR ing the cover medium information with the key stream. Data hiding in the encrypted domain is achieved through public key modulation scheme. Prior to embedding of secret information , Huffman encoding technique is used to compress the payload information in a lossless fashion. At the receiver end a powerful and most popular support vector machine classifier is used to separate encrypted and non encrypted image blocks using support vectors, which defines the hyper plane. Four of the features selected for categorizing encrypted and non encrypted blocks are • Pixel variation in all four directions • Entropy • Standard deviation • Histogram This enables simultaneous decoding of secret information as well as cover medium information. Later Huffman decoding technique is applied to retrieve the payload information in a lossless fashion. Hence the proposed technique assures hundred percent PSNR, higher embedding capacity and greater level of security.

Despite the overwhelming benefits of computed tomography (CT) in diagnosis, there is concern over radiation induced cancer. Retaining diagnostically acceptable medical image quality with minimum radiation dose is the current need in the healthcare system. In this paper we have optimized WH-HYPR low dose image reconstruction algorithm using Taguchi method of experimental design and also studied the clinical permissible low dose range. The Wright Huang- Highly constrained back Projection (WH-HYPR) algorithm is considered as most promising low dose image reconstruction technique. This technique involves the formation of composite and weighted image whose product results in HYPR image with good temporal and spatial characteristics. Taguchi Method is a statistical approach used to fine tune the process influenting parameters more methodically and speedily [1]. Through the research work it is found that the algorithm can be optimized by considering a static constraint angle of 120° while the formation of the backprojection and also CT datasets containing around 15 to 20 time frames with least noise, maximum 20% structural and contrast variability generated a better quality HYPR image. An angle of 1° was found to be the threshold incremental angle for clinically acceptable low dose CT datasets used in WH-HYPR reconstruction. The proposed WH-HYPR algorithm allows better retention of image quality when compared with other reconstruction methods like FBP, AIDR3D and IR for undersampled data. © 2017 IEEE.",Constraint angle; Highly constrained backprojection (HYPR); Incremental angle; Low dose CT imaging; Taguchi method; Undersampling,Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Health care; Image processing; Image quality; Medical imaging; Optimization; Taguchi methods; Back-projection; Constraint angle; Incremental angle; Low-dose CT; Under-sampling; Image reconstruction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In order to preserve these precious music sheets, they needs to be digitization followed by conversion into machine readable format, such that a system can decode the symbolic images automatically and play the music. If an image of the musical work becomes available, the entire process of digitization can be considered as a document image processing application. Musical notes to it machine readable format conversion mainly aims at reading automatically generated musical scores in order to convert them to an electronic format such as MIDI file. In this paper, we propose a system that takes an image of a music sheet as input, identifies music symbols, calculates their pitch and duration and outputs a string corresponding to each line in the music sheet which can be played using Musicgui in DSP Toolbox. Major challenge faced is the removal of staff lines in the music sheet image without losing music symbols. Major steps involved in this are staff line removal, symbol extraction, symbol recognition, and conversion of musical scores into MIDI format. © 2017 IEEE.",MIDI; Musical notes; Projection profile analysis; Segmentation; Staff lines,Image processing; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Automatically generated; Document image processing; Machine-readable format; MIDI; Musical notes; Projection profile analysis; Staff lines; Symbol recognition; Electronic document exchange,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Hence removing the noise from the image is very significant in medical image processing. The existing filters such as mean and median filter are not that efficient in removing impulse and Gaussian noise by retaining the details of the image. In this paper, a new filter is proposed which removes mixed noise such as Gaussian and impulse noise. Initially, pixels of image are separated into non-corrupted pixels and corrupted pixels based on existence of noises in their small neighborhood. The greyscale value of noncorrupted pixels are taken as output directly and for the corrupted pixels, removing Gaussian noises and impulse noises respectively is done based on their characteristics. The results demonstrate that the proposed filter can eliminate mixed noise of different density in a better way by also preserving the details of image when compared with the mean filter or the median filter for mixed noise. © 2017 IEEE.",Gaussian Noise; Impulsive Noise; Mixed noise; Noise and Outliers,Bandpass filters; Computerized tomography; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image denoising; Image processing; Median filters; Medical imaging; Pixels; Tomography; Acquisition time; Computed tomography images; Different densities; Gaussian and impulse noise; Greyscale values; Hybrid filters; Mixed noise; Noise and Outliers; Impulse noise,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The size of lung nodule which reflects the malignant nature helps in early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. False detection of lung nodule will misinterpret healthy patient as lung cancer patient which may lead to wrong medication by the clinician. Existing algorithms for detection of lung nodule like Active Contour Model, Markov Gibbs Random Field model, Expectation Maximization algorithm, Active Appearance Model etc which solves the problem for certain extent, but have drawbacks such as large parameterization, re-initialization, blurring of image, failure to enter concavities, intensity in homogeneity and inability to differentiate different types of nodules. To overcome these drawbacks, a realistic approach is proposed by using partial differential equation based technique. The proposed method adopts Perona-Malik model for enhancement procedure and geometric active contour model for segmentation. Proposed method can efficiently deblur the contours of the original image containing weak or blurred edges. Pre-processed CT images are successfully segmented using geometric active contour model.

This paper presents the effect of salt and pepper noise on prototypical Prediction error expansion based reversible watermarking and proposed prediction error expansion scheme using encoded border embedding for gray scale medical images.

The experiments are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-05] on both the binary and multiclass classification settings. RNN mechanisms have performed well in comparison to the other classical machine learning algorithms. Moreover, long short-term memory (LSTM) mechanism is a modified RNN, as achieved highest accuracy in cross-validation and testing of binary and multi-class classification cases.

It is noticed that, if this event sustained for long time it will cause several brain and heart disorders. Diagnoses of such disorders require identification of apnea event. Recently, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals show proficiency for assessing the sleep quality and detection of apnea event. In this work, amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) components based features extracted from EEG signals, are using for identification of sleep apnea event.

The nature of EEG is highly non-stationary, so an adaptive empirical mode decomposition technique is applied, which convert the nonstationary EEG signals into band limited intrinsic mode functions (IMF).

In the proposed UDDWT-DSR approach, the internal noise due to inadequate illumination of the image has been used for the enhancement purpose. Specifically the darkness is treated as a noise and is used to produce a noise-induced transition of the image from a low contrast to high contrast state. The proposed method first decomposes the given dark image into many sub bands using UDDWT. The stochastic resonance is induced in the approximation and detail coefficients of UDDWT transformed dark image in an iterative fashion. The DSR technique iteratively tunes the UDDWT coefficients using bi-stable system parameters. Computer simulations are carried out for both dark grayscale and color images to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and the results are compared with existing contrast enhancement techniques.

A local neighboring binary pattern (LNBP) is proposed based on the difference of grey values in local neighborhood. LNBP is computed by comparing the difference of grey values of neighboring pixels with grey value of middle pixel for a given reference pixel in an image. The proposed method captured all directional edge information by computing all local neighbors in a clockwise direction. The computational time is reduced significantly. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on three well-known databases: Open access series of imaging studies (OASIS) MRI, Emphysema-CT and NEMA-CT. The average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

Any attempt of developing the system dealing with the fish disease diagnosis and to overcome various difficulties is in it has still not met any extra ordinary success. Identification of diseased fish at early stage is necessary step to prevent from spreading disease. This paper recognizes and identifies the EUS (Epizootic Ulcerative syndrome) disease which is caused by bn Aphanomyces invadans, a fungal pathogen. It is a red spot disease and looks like ulcer hence it is generally misidentified by the people. The paper is divided into two parts, in the first part segmentation has been applied to enhance the image, various edge detection techniques have applied to get the useful information and Morphological operations have been applied on the EUS diseased fish image. In second part features are extracted from the EUS infected fish image through different feature Descriptors i.e. HOG (Histogram of Gradient),FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and classify the EUS infected and Non-EUS infected fish image through Machine Learning Algorithms and find the classification accuracy through Classifier. If PCA applied after feature extraction then it increases the accuracy as it is a dimensional reduction. The proposed combination of techniques gives better accuracy as compared to the others.

This research aims to combine color information from RGBD with motion information from skeletal joints in order to capture subtle motions in the video which in used to tackle temporal features extraction. The researchers show this by using combined deep architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoders (SAE). In this model CNN is used to learn motion representations from Motion History Images (MHIs) of sampled RGB image frames. Whereas SAE is used to learn discriminative movements of human skeletal joints by taking the distances of joints from mean joint at each sampled frame. The proposed model is able to learn low level abstractions of joint motion sequences as well as how motion changes with location of image in each MHI frame. Both deep architectures were trained separately by averaging the Softmax class posteriors across the sampled frames to obtain score of the video clip. Normalize class scores of each of the networks in [0,1] range and perform late fusion by taking weighted mean of class scores based on relative performances of the two networks.

This paper presents the document image binarization method by adaptive image contrast which is the integration of the local image gradient and the local image contrast which is lenient to background and text variation generated by various document degradations. Initially, an adaptive contrast map is constructed for the input degraded document image by the proposed document image binarization method. Then, the binarization is performed on this adaptive contrast map and the binarized contrast map is integrated with the Canny's edge map for determining the text stroke edge pixels. After that, depends on the local threshold which is defined by the identified text stroke edge pixels' intensities in the local window, the document text is divided.

The simplicity of fixed-point circuitry has always been so tempting to implement EVD algorithms in fixed-point arithmetic. Working towards an effective fixed-point design, integer bit-width allocation is a significant step which has a crucial impact on accuracy and hardware efficiency. This paper investigates the shortcomings of the existing range estimation methods while deriving bounds for the variables of the EVD algorithm. In light of the circumstances, we introduce a range estimation approach based on vector and matrix norm properties together with a scaling procedure that maintains all the assets of an analytical method. The method could derive robust and tight bounds for the variables of EVD algorithm. The bounds derived using the proposed approach remain same for any input matrix and are also independent of the number of iterations or size of the problem. Some benchmark hyperspectral data sets have been used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. It was found that by the proposed range estimation approach, all the variables generated during the computation of Jacobi EVD is bounded within ±1. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer architecture; Efficiency; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Image processing; Jacobian matrices; Matrix algebra; Range finders; Spectroscopy; Analytical method; Dimensionality reduction; Eigenvalue decomposition; Hardware efficiency; Hyperspectral Data; Number of iterations; Range estimation; Scaling procedures; Fixed point arithmetic,,,IEEE Computer Society,21649766,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Conf.

Scrambling process plays an important role in achieving better confusion during the image encryption. An image encryption scheme based on cyclic shift and chaotic system has been proposed by Wang X-Y et al, 2015 [1]. In that approach, the scrambling process based on logistic map sequence was not efficient to randomize the pixels during image encryption. The randomization resulted in repetitive pixel addresses before reaching the maximal length sequence i.e. total number of image pixels. The lossless reproduction of the secret image during the decryption can only be improved by choosing proper scrambling source during the encryption. This paper addresses some of the issues of that work and proposes an alternate way to perform scrambling with enhanced multiuser improved authentication mechanism. © 2017 IEEE.",Chaotic system; Image encryption; logistic map,Chaotic systems; Facsimile; Image enhancement; Image processing; Pixels; Random processes; Authentication mechanisms; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Image recovery; Information sharing; Logistic maps; Maximal length sequences; Process-based; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

The image analysis of documents mainly focused on printed and handwritten document images. In printed document image analysis, the input image is that of machine printed document, where as in handwritten document image analysis, it is of document handwritten by different persons on a paper by using pen or pencil. Presently most of the research work addresses issues related to handwritten document images and the Kannada script. The printed script recognition system is much easier than handwritten script recognition system. In printed documents, font style and size of the characters standardized but handwritten characters vary in size and style of font from person to person and time to time, which is a very tedious job for recognition. In this paper, we proposed a new novel approach for restoration of degraded Kannada handwritten paper inscription (hastaprati) using the combination of special local and global binarization techniques, by eliminating of non-uniformly illuminated background. The performance evaluation is done by calculating the values of MSE and PSNR and these results are compared with manual results obtained by the Epigraphists. It is also compared with other standard methods, namely, souvola and niblack in the literature, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Restoration of degraded Kannada handwritten documents plays an important role in age identification, Kannada character recognition and classification for the Kannada handwritten script written on paper (hastaprati). © 2017 IEEE.",Degraded document; Hastaprati; Image enhancement; Image restoration; Kannada script; Local Otsu; Local Standard deviation; Paper inscription; Sobel Filter,Character recognition; Image analysis; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Information retrieval systems; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Restoration; Degraded documents; Hastaprati; Kannada scripts; Local Otsu; Local standard deviation; Sobel filter; Image enhancement,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is a specialized search to find digital images. In most applications of image processing, it becomes necessary to find images by using text, keywords or by using any other features of an image. The conventional or traditional methods of image retrieval includes addition of metadata like captions, important keywords to describe image etc by using which retrieval of images takes place. The manual annotation of images is highly time-consuming, laborious and costly in terms of investment of money. Thus, automatic image annotation is important and there are various techniques to do so. The increasing web applications and the semantic web have encouraged the development of tools for automatic image annotation. When an image is searched on the web, it is really a tedious task to retrieve any image as the database is huge. Therefore, Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) i.e. Query by Image Content (QIC) or Content-based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR) is used. It is a computer vision based approach to address the image retrieval problem. The content of an image (colour, text, shape or any other information etc) is used to retrieve any information in the visual form. This paper presents a theoretical study and practical implementation of CBIR methods based on colour and texture carried out in MATLAB, and the results of the implementation are stated and their comparison is made. The objective of the work reported in this paper is to practically study CBIR methods and understand how the visual information can be retrieved using them. © 2017 IEEE.",CBIR; colour; image; retrieval; shape etc; texture,Color; Color image processing; Content based retrieval; Image analysis; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image texture; MATLAB; Query processing; Textures; Automatic image annotation; CBIR; Content-Based Image Retrieval; Content-based visual information retrieval; image; Image retrieval systems; retrieval; shape etc; Search engines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

The light diffusion, scattering and attenuation of clouds create blur effect or affect the contrast of the images. The interference of cloud over images degrades the quality of satellite images and tends to suppress the essential information in those images. Hence, the removal of clouds greatly help in the efficient processing of satellite images. The proposed cloud removal method, Normalized Intensity Mapping (NIM) is confirmed to be effective for cloud removal. This technique was experimented on the cloud covered real-time images and was found to outperform its competitive techniques. The quality of NIMCR is assessed quantitatively by Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and qualitatively by Human Visual Perception (HVP). This technique due to its applicability in real-time and satellite images, qualifies itself as a valuable addition in the array of image pre-processing techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",cloud removal; intensity mapping; intensity transformation; normalized intensity; thin cloud,Mapping; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Cloud removal; Human visual perception; Image preprocessing; Intensity mapping; intensity transformation; normalized intensity; Peak signal to noise ratio; Satellite images; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Aadhaar is the unique identification scheme of India, handled by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which deals with big data. Every person above the age of 5 years has to register their demographic details (Name, Date of Birth, Address and Phone number) and biometric details (10 fingerprints and both iris) and then these details are used to verify the authenticity of the person when any services are required by him. Passport is a legal document that is carried by a person when he travels between countries, but in the case of the older passports with no biometric data, a person may have more than one legal passport with different demographic details. This paper does a case study on the existing de-duplication methods for passport enrolments and other such documents. In the case of newer passports, it takes 10 days to link with Aadhaar at the time of registration, hence the aim is to reduce the processing time of the linking and verification. String matching algorithms are used to compare the demographics, and techniques such as genetic programming and hashing are used for de-duplication. This case study also helps identify big and fast data platforms to identify such e-governance plans, by evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of existing algorithms. This system aims to predict the duplication of passports by linking Aadhaar and passport details, and to reduce the processing time of the Aadhaar database by using parallel algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Aadhaar; big data; biometrics; de-duplication; graphics processing unit (GPU); image processing; passports; UIDAI,Authentication; Biometrics; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Government data processing; Graphics processing unit; Image processing; Population statistics; Program processors; Aadhaar; De duplications; Emerging technologies; Legal documents; passports; Processing time; UIDAI; Unique identifications; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

To provide security images always encrypted and stored in the cloud. Along with it, there is also a continuous need to outsource image computation with high complexity to the cloud for its economic computing resources and on-demand ubiquitous access. Feature extraction and representation on encrypted images is a crucial step for multimedia processing on the cloud. Extraction of ideal features from encrypted images without revealing the intrinsic content of the images is privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme PP-LBP (Privacy preserving - Local Binary Patterns) that retrieves LBP based image features from encrypted images. In the Proposed approach, the encryption algorithm is applied on MSB (Most Significant Bit) plane of Image. All the operations are performed on encrypted images without revealing any information to cloud service providers. The method generates exactly same LBP based feature between encrypted and unencrypted images without any overhead of communication between cloud service provider and client.

In this study, we use images corrupted by three types of noise such as gaussian, salt & pepper and speckle.

Brain tissue is explicitly complex and it consists of three normal main tissues named White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM) and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and abnormal tissues like tumor and edema. These normal and abnormal tissues can be detected using segmentation of the brain MR image and are very important for surgical planning and in diagnosing neurological diseases. This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of normal and abnormal tissues. Anisotropic diffusion filtering is used as the preprocessing step. The part of the algorithm used to detect the healthy tissues WM, GM, and CSF is based on multilevel thresholding that selects the best threshold values using Electro-magnetism-Like algorithm. A Region-based Active Contour is used to detect the tumor. A trained Support Vector Machine with different kernels which can be treated as KSVM is used for the classification of the tumor. In the classification process, features are extracted from the tumor images using the single level decomposition of 2-D Daubechies DWT. The high dimensioned feature vector is reduced by using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The suggested method can identify the benign and malignant type of tumors. The pursuance of the suggested method is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, segmentation accuracy using ground truth images and results are compared with some of the existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",Active Contours; CSF; DWT; Electro-magnetism-Like algorithm; GM; ICA; KSVM; MRI; WM,Brain; Cerebrospinal fluid; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Histology; Image classification; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Independent component analysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal reconstruction; Support vector machines; Tissue; Tumors; Active contours; Anisotropic diffusion filtering; Cerebral spinal fluids; Classification process; Independent component analysis(ICA); KSVM; Multilevel thresholding; Region based active contours; Tissue engineering,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

In recent years, biofield image processing has added tremendous interest in medical diagnostics. Existence of human biofield has been now proved beyond doubt. Many decades ago, followers of Theosophy published several biofield images, calling them Thought-Forms images of human beings. They claim to have captured these images using their power of clairvoyance. In the literature containing these images, the authors have commented against each image qualifying them as good or bad thought process of the individuals. However, no scientific proof was provided in their literature. This background was the motivation in this paper to undertake a scientific analysis of the truth or falsehood of their comments. For this, the powerful image processing tools in the MATLAB were relied upon. For image analysis, HSV space, rather than RGB color space, has been often used, and this was followed systematically in the analysis of true color images of Thought Forms with the main objective to identify patterns in two broad categories of Good and Bad. © 2017 IEEE.",HSV; Human Biofield; Image Analysis; RGB Color Space; Theosophy,Color; Diagnosis; Image analysis; Medical imaging; Human Biofield; Image processing technique; Image processing tools; Medical diagnostics; RGB color space; Scene interpretation; Scientific analysis; Theosophy; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In this approach, medical image information is embedded using discrete cosine transform (DCT)-singular value decomposition (SVD)-based embedding process. The medical image is encrypted using CS encryption before embedding into the standard image. This encrypted medical image is inserted into the singular values of DCT coefficients of the standard image to get the stego image. The experimental results show that the encrypted medical image is successfully extracted from the stego image under various image processing attacks at recovering side. The result analysis also shows improved imperceptibility of the stego image with a peak signal-to-noise ratio value above 60 dB for all types of medical images under consideration.

A distinctive-type of OCR is used to process Arabic characters, namely, Arabic OCR. OCR is increasingly used in many applications, where this process is preferred to automatically perform a process without human association. The Quranic text contains two elements, namely, diacritics and characters. However, processing these elements may cause malfunction to the OCR system and reduce its level of accuracy. In this paper, a new method is proposed to check the similarity and originality of Quranic content. This method is based on a combination of Quranic diacritic and character recognition techniques. Diacritic detections are performed using a region-based algorithm. An optimization technique is applied to increase the recognition ratio. Moreover, character recognition is performed based on the projection method. An optimization technique is applied to increase the recognition ratio. The result of the proposed method is compared with the standard Mushaf al Madinah benchmark to find similarities that match with texts of the Holy Quran.

Different from the existing works geared towards cosegmentation or co-localization, in this paper, we explore a new joint processing topic: co-skeletonization, which is defined as joint skeleton extraction of common objects in a set of semantically similar images. Object skeletonization in real world images is a challenging problem, because there is no prior knowledge of the object's shape if we consider only a single image. This motivates us to resort to the idea of object co-skeletonization hoping that the commonness prior existing across the similar images may help, just as it does for other joint processing problems such as cosegmentation. Noting that skeleton can provide good scribbles for segmentation, and skeletonization, in turn, needs good segmentation, we propose a coupled framework for co-skeletonization and co-segmentation tasks so that they are well informed by each other, and benefit each other synergistically. Since it is a new problem, we also construct a benchmark dataset for the co-skeletonization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed method achieves very competitive results. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Data mining; Musculoskeletal system; Pattern recognition; Benchmark datasets; Co segmentations; Co-localizations; Joint processing; Object's shapes; Prior knowledge; Real-world image; Skeleton extraction; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Conf.

This paper proposes a new pansharpening method that is an integration of contourlet transform with sparse representation (CT-SR). CT is used to perform multiscale decomposition of input images to separate high-frequency and low-frequency subbands. High-frequency subbands are fused based on local energy calculation whereas SR using training dictionary is used to extract salient features to fuse low-frequency subbands. The synthesized multispectral image is obtained by combining fused low- and high-frequency subbands. It is observed that spatial resolution of synthesized multispectral image is improved, but at the same time, the original spectral resolution is also preserved. The detailed comparison between the resultant images of CT-SR and commonly used pansharpening techniques including wavelet transform with sparse representation are carried out at visual assessment level as well as through calculation of various performance indices. It is found that CT-SR performs is improved compared to other algorithms considered in this work. © 2017 IETE.",Contourlet transform; Fusion; Pansharpening; Sparse representation; Spatial resolution; Spectral resolution,Fusion reactions; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image resolution; Spectral resolution; Wavelet transforms; Contourlet transform; High spatial resolution multispectral images; Low and high frequencies; Multi-scale Decomposition; Multispectral images; Pan-sharpening; Sparse representation; Spatial resolution; Computerized tomography,,,Taylor and Francis Ltd,3772063,,,,English,IETE J Res,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019561804

Methods: A fully automatic segmentation of sino-nasal and pharyngeal airway subregions was implemented in MATLAB programing environment. The novelty of the algorithm is automatic initialization of contours in upper airway subregions. The algorithm is based on boundary definitions of the human anatomy along with shape constraints with an automatic initialization of contours to develop a complete algorithm which has a potential to enhance utility at clinical level. Post-initialization; five segmentation techniques: Chan-Vese level set (CVL), localized Chan-Vese level set (LCVL), Bhattacharya distance level set (BDL), Grow Cut (GC), and Sparse Field method (SFM) were used to test the robustness of automatic initialization. Results: Precision and F-score were found to be greater than 80% for all the regions with all five segmentation methods. High precision and low recall were observed with BDL and GC techniques indicating an under segmentation. Low precision and high recall values were observed with CVL and SFM methods indicating an over segmentation. A Larger F-score value was observed with SFM method for all the subregions. Minimum F-score value was observed for naso-ethmoidal and sphenoidal air sinus region, whereas a maximum F-score was observed in maxillary air sinuses region. The contour initialization was more accurate for maxillary air sinuses region in comparison with sphenoidal and naso-ethmoid regions. Conclusion: The overall F-score was found to be greater than 80% for all the airway subregions using five segmentation techniques, indicating accurate contour initialization. Robustness of the algorithm needs to be further tested on severely deformed cases and on cases with different races and ethnicity for it to have global acceptance in Katradental radKatraiology workflow. © 2017, CARS.",Fully automatic; Landmarks; Obstructive sleep apnea; Upper airway subregions; Volumetric analysis,"adolescent; adult; anatomic landmark; anatomical concepts; Article; automation; classification algorithm; clinical article; comparative study; cone beam computed tomography; ethmoid sinus; human; image segmentation; maxillary sinus; paranasal sinus; pharynx; pilot study; priority journal; scoring system; sphenoid; three dimensional imaging; upper respiratory tract; algorithm; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; female; image processing; male; paranasal sinus; pharynx; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Paranasal Sinuses; Pharynx; Pilot Projects; Young Adult","Sardana, H.K.; Computational Instrumentation, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments OrganisationIndia; email: hk_sardana@csio.res.in",,Springer Verlag,18616410,,,28755036,English,Int.

Existing blind super-resolution (SR) techniques that account for motion blur are restricted to fronto-parallel planar scenes. We initially develop an SR motion blur model to explain the image formation process in 3D scenes. We then use this model to solve for the three unknowns - the camera trajectories, the depth map of the scene, and the latent HR image. We first compute the global HR camera motion corresponding to each LR observation from patches lying on a reference depth layer in the input images. Using the estimated trajectories, we compute the latent HR image and the underlying depth map iteratively using an alternating minimization framework.

Though hyperspectral data gives accurate results than their multispectral counterparts, they are computationally more complex due to their high dimensionality. One of the classical problem while dealing with supervised hyperspectral classification is the class imbalance problem that arises due to the limited availability of samples for training. In order to deal with high dimensionality, many feature mining techniques has been proposed in literature for hyperspectral images. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral image classification method based on two-dimensional Empirical Wavelet Transform (2D-EWT) feature extraction and compare it with that of Image Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD) based extracted features and raw features. Here, the focus is upon the fact that the number of features trained should be less than what is to be tested. Since the computational time for classification is also of prime importance, only some of the fast and best of the classifiers are selected. Sparse-based classifiers are one of the fast and efficient method for supervised classification of hyperspectral images. Subspace Pursuit (SP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms are used in our experiments for sparse-based classification. Other classifiers used are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hybrid Support Vector Selection and Adaptation (HSVSA).

The proposed interpolation technique is an improvement of the existing neighbor mean interpolation (NMI) technique in such a way that the interpolated image would have more resemblance to the input image. The proposed interpolation technique has less computational cost like NMI as it does not perform much computation during estimation unlike B-Spline, Bilinear Interpolation etc. The proposed data hiding scheme comes into the category of reversible data hiding scheme as the input image can be reconstructed after extraction of the entire secret data at the receiver side. Thus, it reduces the communication cost. Furthermore, the proposed data hiding scheme identifies the smooth and complex regions of the interpolated (or cover) image by dividing the same into blocks. It then embeds more bits into the complex regions of the image so that data hiding capacity as well as the image quality can be enhanced.

Efforts are being made to tackle this problem as agriculture is an important aspect of our economy. Due to diseases, a major part of crops produced is lost every year. This is due to lack of expertise among the farmers, failing to detect and diagnose the disease correctly in time or due to commencement of control measure in late. To prevent crop loss, image processing for diagnosis of disease symptom using soft computing techniques is a need of modern day agriculture. In this study, initial focus was paid towards automatic identification of leaves between okra and bitter gourd from the images. To diagnose disease symptom from leaf images, forty-three morphological features of leaves of both the crops were chosen. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient technique was exercised to set key identifying features depending on a particular type of leaf image. Ten key morphological features of okra leaf and nine key morphological features of bitter gourd leaf were selected for the purpose. The proposed technique was experimented on 79 and 75 okra and bitter gourd leaf images, respectively. Finally Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (YVMV) disease gradation was done based on entropy based binning and Naive Bayes classifier.

Variations in face image due to change in illumination, expression and presence of occlusions along with aging present many challenges to face recognition system. In this paper a new approach to robust face recognition using Polar FFT features modeled as symbolic data is proposed. Initially the face segment is cropped from the image using Viola-Jones algorithm and is converted into gray scale image of size 120 × 120 pixels. 2D-DFT is performed on pre-processed image. The dominant magnitude of 2D-DFT coefficients are computed using polar fourier transform technique and are represented as 1D P-FFT. The magnitude that represents maximum value in 1D P-FFT is considered as a feature value. The extracted feature value is used to construct a symbolic object to represent a face image. Further, a new symbolic similarity measure is devised and employed for assigning test symbolic object to a face class. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with AR database and an average accuracy of 96.25% is achieved. 100% and 97% verification rate is achieved on the ORL and LFW face databases respectively. The various experiments conducted on AR, ORL and LFW databases using the proposed symbolic data modeling approach shows that this method has a very high degree of recognition and is better compared to some of the recently reported face recognition techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Face recognition; Polar-FFT; Symbolic data modeling and analysis; Viola–Jones,Database systems; Design for testability; Fast Fourier transforms; Image processing; Image segmentation; Information analysis; DFT coefficients; Face recognition systems; Face recognition technique; Gray-scale images; Model and analysis; Processed images; Symbolic similarity; Viola - Jones algorithms; Face recognition,"Kagawade, V.C.; Department of Computer Applications, Basaveshwar Engineering CollegeIndia; email: vishwanath.1312@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,313203,,PTNRA,,English,Pattern Recogn.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023181459

This meshless method is employed to review the implant underneath intracranial pressure (ICP) conditions with a standard ICP range of 7 mm of Hg to 15 mm of Hg. The algorithm is used to introduce uniform porosity within the implant enabling the implant behaviour with respect to ICP conditions. However, increase in the porosity leads to variation in deformation and equivalent stress, respectively. The meshless approach provides a valuable insight in order to know the effect of total deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises stress) and replaces the standard meshing strategies. The patient CT data (computed tomography) is processed in MIMICS software to get the mesh model. An entirely unique modelling approach is developed to model the cranial implant with the assistance of the Rhinoceros software. This modelling methodology is the easiest one and addressing both the symmetrical and asymmetrical defects. The implant is embedded in a unit cell-based porous structure with the help of an algorithm, and this algorithm is simple to manage the consistency in porosity and pore size of the scaffold. Totally six types of implants are modelled with variation in porosity and replicate the original cranial bone. Among six implants, Type 2 (porosity 82.62%) and Type 5 (porosity 45.73%) implants are analysed with the meshless approach under ICP. The total deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises stress) of porous implants are compared with the solid implant under same ICP conditions. Consequently, distinctive materials are used for structural analysis such as titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), respectively. The deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises stress) results are obtained through the structural analysis. It was observed from the results that the titanium-based solid implant is the best implant in all aspects, while considering weight and osseointegration PEEK-based Type 5 implant is the best one. A novel free-form closed curve network (FCN) technique is successfully developed to model a cranial implant for symmetrical and asymmetrical defects. The porous implant is adequately modelled through the unit cell algorithm and analysed through meshless approach. The implementation of 3D printed component will allow physicians to gain knowledge and successfully plan the preoperative surgery. © 2017, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",Intracranial pressure; Meshless method; Scaffold algorithm; Symmetrical and asymmetrical defects; Unit cell parameters,3D printers; Cells; Computerized tomography; Cytology; Deformation; Ethers; Ketones; Musculoskeletal system; Pore size; Porosity; Scaffolds (biology); Titanium; Titanium alloys; Computational studies; Intra-cranial pressure; Mesh-less methods; Meshing strategies; Modelling methodology; Polyether ether ketones (PEEK); Porosity and pore size; Unit cell parameters; Structural analysis; polyetheretherketone; titanium; algorithm; Article; computer assisted tomography; computer model; free form closed curve network; image processing; mechanical stress; porosity; priority journal; structure analysis; unit cell algorithm,"Phanindra Bogu, V.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Institute of Technology WarangalIndia; email: phanibogu@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,1400118,,MBECD,,English,Med.

The foremost stage for computer-aided diagnosis of liver is the identification of liver region. Liver segmentation algorithms extract liver image from scan images which helps in virtual surgery simulation, speedup the diagnosis, accurate investigation and surgery planning. The existing liver segmentation algorithms try to extort exact liver image from abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. It is an open problem because of ambiguous boundaries, large variation in intensity distribution, variability of liver geometry from patient to patient and presence of noise. A novel approach is proposed to meet challenges in extracting the exact liver image from abdominal CT scan images. The proposed approach consists of three phases: (1) Pre-processing (2) CT scan image transformation to Neutrosophic Set (NS) and (3) Post-processing. In pre-processing, the noise is removed by median filter. The “new structure” is designed to transform a CT scan image into neutrosophic domain which is expressed using three membership subset: True subset (T), False subset (F) and Indeterminacy subset (I). This transform approximately extracts the liver image structure. In post processing phase, morphological operation is performed on indeterminacy subset (I) and apply Chan-Vese (C-V) model with detection of initial contour within liver without user intervention. This resulted in liver boundary identification with high accuracy. Experiments show that, the proposed method is effective, robust and comparable with existing algorithm for liver segmentation of CT scan images. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chan-Vese model; Computed Tomography; Indeterminacy subset; Liver segmentation; Neutrosophic Set,"Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Median filters; Set theory; Surgery; Tomography; Boundary identification; Chan-Vese model; Indeterminacy subset; Intensity distribution; Liver segmentation; Morphological operations; Neutrosophic sets; Virtual surgery simulations; Computerized tomography; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; human; liver; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28946992,English,Comput.

The nonlinear reconstruction problem, to reconstruct the fluorophore absorption coefficient, is of interest in imaging studies as it presents the possibility of better reconstructions owing to a more appropriate model. Accurate and computationally efficient forward models are also critical in the reconstruction process. The SPN approximation to the radiative transfer equation (RTE) is gaining importance for tomographic reconstructions owing to its computational advantages over the full RTE while being more accurate and applicable than the commonly used diffusion approximation. This paper presents Gauss-Newton-based fully nonlinear reconstruction for the SP3 approximated fluorescence optical tomography problem with respect to shape as well as the conventional finite-element method-based representations. The contribution of this paper is the Frechet derivative calculations for this problem and demonstration of reconstructions in both representations. For the shape reconstructions, radial-basis-function represented level-set-based shape representations are used. We present reconstructions for tumor-mimicking test objects in scattering and absorption dominant settings, respectively, for moderately noisy data sets in order to demonstrate the viability of the formulation. Comparisons are presented between the nonlinear and linearized reconstruction schemes in an element wise setting to illustrate the benefits of using the former especially for absorption dominant media. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Fluorescence tomography; image reconstruction - iterative methods; optical imaging/OCT/DOT,"Concrete beams and girders; Finite element method; Fluorescence; Image reconstruction; Iterative methods; Linearization; Nonlinear optics; Optical tomography; Repair; Computational advantages; Computationally efficient; Fluorescence tomography; Non linear reconstruction; Optical imaging; Radiative Transfer Equation(RTE); Scattering and absorption; Tomographic reconstruction; Image processing; Article; finite element analysis; fluorescence optical tomography; image reconstruction; mathematical model; nonlinear system; optical tomography; algorithm; animal; diagnostic imaging; image processing; imaging phantom; mouse; neoplasm; optical tomography; procedures; Algorithms; Animals; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mice; Neoplasms; Phantoms, Imaging; Tomography, Optical","Naik, N.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Lasers and Photonics, IIT KanpurIndia; email: nnaik@iitk.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2780062,,ITMID,28644802,English,IEEE Trans.

The evolution of steel microstructure through various heat treatment processes is an important factor in controlling properties and performance of steel. Extensive experimentations have been performed to enhance the properties of steel by customizing heat treatment processes. However, experimental analyses are always associated with high resource requirements in terms of cost and time. As an alternative solution, we propose an image processing-based technique for refinement of raw plain carbon steel microstructure images, into a digital form, usable in experiments related to heat treatment processes of steel in diverse applications. The proposed work follows the conventional steps practiced by materials engineers in manual refinement of steel images; and it appropriately utilizes basic image processing techniques (including filtering, segmentation, opening, and clustering) to automate the whole process. The proposed refinement of steel microstructure images is aimed to enable computer-aided simulations of heat treatment of plain carbon steel, in a timely and cost-efficient manner; hence it is beneficial for the materials and metallurgy industry.

Here, we propose a novel approach for the reduction of random-valued impulse noise in images and its hardware implementation on various state-of-the-art FPGAs. The presented algorithm consists of two stages in which the first stage detects whether pixels have been corrupted by impulse noise and the second stage performs a filtering operation on the detected noisy pixels. The human visual system is sensitive to the presence of edges in any image therefore the filtering stage consists of an edge preserving median filter which performs the filtering operation while preserving the underlying fine image features. Experimentally, it has been found that the proposed scheme yields a better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to other existing median-based impulse noise filtering schemes. The algorithm is implemented using the high-level synthesis tool PARO as a highly parallel and deeply pipelined hardware design that simultaneously exploits loop level as well as instruction level parallelism with a very short latency of only few milliseconds for 16 bit images of size 512 × 512 pixels. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",FPGA; Image denoising; Noise detection; Parallel architecture; Random-valued impulse noise,Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; High level synthesis; Image acquisition; Image processing; Impulse noise; Median filters; Parallel architectures; Pixels; Program processors; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal to noise ratio; Filtering operations; Hardware accelerators; Hardware implementations; Impulse noise removals; Instruction level parallelism; Noise detection; Peak signal to noise ratio; Random-valued impulse noise; Image denoising,"Bhadouria, V.S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: vivek@hotmail.de",,Springer New York LLC,19398018,,,,English,J.

First, the shortcomings of FCNN in encrypting image are identified, and the FCNN model is then modified to address these shortcomings. Specifically, a theoretical framework is developed to identify the values of the parameters of FCNN to generate chaotic signals, which are in turn utilized to encrypt the image. The encryption method is designed where an encrypted pixel is generated based on the corresponding plaintext pixel together with the neighbouring encrypted pixels. The proposed method has a key sensitivity in the order of 10?10 to achieve adequate security robustness.

While converting into e-documents, the technology in a position has to provide a large amount of memory space to store the same data's. In order to manage the huge memory, the documents are compressing before store. In connection with the above points, in this paper, we have proposed a novel lossless compression scheme of pixel based technique for compressing the grayscale images. This proposed scheme can be classified into two different processes. One is compression process before store the image and other one is decompression while retrieving the same image back. The significant of this technique is that, the image pixels positions are interchanging as much as possible within the image itself. Due to these processes, the proposed technique can be achieved the high complexity, However, it's not an easy task to retrieve the same image by third parties. In addition, the pixel based technique has obtained good quality of the reconstructed image, it has taken minimum execution time for compression and decompression processes, 60% of the original image can be reduced during the compression process and an error rate is minimum, it mean that near to zero. Finally, the proposed compression technique has provided a lossless compression for given grayscale input images. © 2017 IEEE.",Compression; Compression ratio; Decompression; Grayscale image; LS Compression,Compaction; Compression ratio (machinery); Health care; Image processing; Pixels; Compression process; Compression scheme; Compression techniques; Decompression; Gray-scale images; Lossless compression; Pixel-based techniques; Reconstructed image; Image compression,,Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,IEEE Int.

It is primarily an infection of lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body such as brain, intestine, kidney and spine. TB remains one of the leading cause of death in developing countries, although most are preventable if diagnosed early and treated. Among the available tools, Sputum smear microscopy is the most widely used one for TB detection. It is done manually and is often time consuming; a laboratory technician is expected to spend at least 25 minutes per slide, limiting the number of slides that can be screened. Also any incorrect diagnosis will leads to serious health issues. So a solution is Automatic screening methods. Many attempts have been made to develop automatic approaches to identify TB bacteria from microscopic sputum smear images. In this paper, we present an automatic TB diagnosis technique using morphological features and ellipse fitting. Microscopic images of sputum smear are collected from infected subjects. These images are transformed into HSV color space for a better analysis, which is thresholded using hue range of red pink color. The resultant images will contain TB bacilli along with non-TB objects. In order to identify the TB regions from the non-TB regions, shape features of every identified region is evaluated. Finally a new algorithm that make use of concave contour points as well as ellipse fitting is performed to separate out the overlapping bacilli region and add them to the total count of bacilli. © 2017 IEEE.",Concave point extraction; Contour segmentation; Ellipse fitting; HSV; Polygon approximation; Shape Feature analysis; Tuberculosis(TB); Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN),Bacilli; Bacteria; Color; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Food products; Geometry; Image processing; Contour segmentation; Ellipse fitting; Point extraction; Polygon approximation; Shape features; Tuberculosis(TB); Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN); Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The CFT's circularly shifts the larger search window to find most likely position of the target. The need of larger search window to cover both background and object make an algorithm sensitive to the background and the target occlusions. Further, the use of fixed-sized windows for training makes them incapable to handle scale variations during tracking. To address these problems, we propose two layer target representation in which both global and local appearances of the target is considered. Multiple local patches in the local layer provide robustness to the background changes and the target occlusion. The target representation is enhanced by employing additional reversed RGB channels to prevent the loss of black objects in background during tracking. The final target position is obtained by the adaptive weighted average of confidence maps from global and local layers. Furthermore, the target scale variation in tracking is handled by the statistical model, which is governed by adaptive constraints to ensure reliability and accuracy in scale estimation.

There are many difficulties in choosing particular apparel with a complete sense of satisfaction. The main idea of this paper is to help the user to find best outfit according to the current trends and their interest. Initially, the system gets the body measurements from the user. Then the internal mechanism uses image processing technique to morph the chosen outfit with the created model of the user. The inbuilt AI renders the users 3-D model and searches its database which contains all the possible matches of outfits from the database of leading fashion designers and finds the suitable outfit-combinations and gives suggestions for chosen outfits. The application saves all the data in personal account for future use such that user's privacy is maintained. Next time, when the user is to make a new purchase, the AI implicitly suggests the suitable outfit, without the need for input. © 2017 IEEE.",AI; Outfits; Suggestion; User; Wardrobe,Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Computer science; Energy management; Energy resources; Materials; Body measurements; Fashion designers; Human society; Image processing technique; Outfits; Suggestion; User; Wardrobe; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

These approaches take a pair of images as input and establish correspondences based on global strategy (using the whole image information) or sparse strategy (using key-points features). These correspondences allow solving a set of linear equations related to the 3D information and camera pose in that environment. These past years, machine learning has been considered as an efficient way to tackle different problems in image processing and computer vision fields. To handle the task in hand, we propose to learn directly the mapping function between the acquired information from the camera and its pose using sparse decision forest.

Sometimes, remote sensing images have dead pixels or pixel missing gives poor visual quality. It is mainly due to the presence of clouds, fogs, or shadows since these images are acquired by sensors at different seasons. The other serious problems in remote sensing images are instrumentation error, registration error and losses of image data during transmission. To get a good visual quality images, degraded remote sensing images are processed by using the application of inpainting. The main objectives of this image inpainting approaches are to fill lost parts of images, delete unwanted objects, remove noise in images and to enhance images quality. Image completion or image inpainting process is one in which the damaged portions are reconstructed or to fill the lost regions using data collected from surrounding areas in original image.

Alerting the nearby railway station, the locomotive pilot and the forest range officer if any such movement is detected Monitoring involves elephant detection using image processing by applying the techniques of background subtraction and foreground enhancement. The result shows significant improvement in detecting and preventing elephant accidents compared to the existing system (without FLANN). © 2017 IEEE.",background subtraction; foreground enhancement; image processing,Accidents; Forestry; Image enhancement; Image processing; Railroad accidents; Search engines; Signal processing; Background subtraction; Existing systems; Forest area; Human-wildlife conflict; Nearest-neighbour search algorithms; Railway stations; Nearest neighbor search,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Identification of plane of symmetry is a critical step in brain image analysis. Brain symmetry gives two hemispheres. This paper proposes a new method for evaluating best symmetry plane of brain images using Genetic Algorithm (GA) from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). MRI scan is the best modality for brain images, which helps to look for tumors and other diseases in the brain. Symmetry can be reflected in MR image representing axial/horizontal and coronal slices of the brain. Genetic algorithm is an optimization technique which helps to find the optimized solutions/feasible solutions. GA adopted to achieve better results, faster processing times and it is used in more applications. The GA optimization is performed using the selection, mutation and crossover. Major operations are preprocessing, random selection of coordinates and genetic algorithm. Morphological operators help to extract the region of interest from brain image and unwanted portions of MRI images are removed. This proposed method provides better symmetry value with an accuracy of 90%. This performance leads to good approximation of brain tumor segmentation. © 2017 IEEE.",bilateral symmetry; Genetic Algorithm; MR brain image; MRI; Optimization; Symmetry plane,Brain; Brain mapping; Genetic algorithms; Image processing; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Optimization; Tumors; Bilateral symmetry; Brain image analysis; Brain images; Brain tumor segmentation; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Morphological operator; Optimization techniques; Symmetry planes; Magnetic resonance imaging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

India has 17% of world's population suffering from breast cancer. World Health Organization's International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimates that more than 4,00,000 women die every year due to breast cancer. Thus early identification of breast cancer plays a vital role in reducing the mortality rate. Medical infrared thermography is gaining popularity as it can detect abnormality at an early stage when compared to mammogram. In this work an attempt has been made to distinguish healthy and pathological subjects using Bidirectional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) and uniform Rotated Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). Frontal thermogram images are pre-processed using anisotropic diffusion filtering which preserves sharp edges, fine details and effectively removes noise. Level set segmentation technique is applied on pre-processed image to obtain the required Region Of Interest (ROI). The delineated ROI's are subjected to BEMD where the image is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residue. IMF1 is considered for further processing as it contains maximum edge information about the image. Texture analysis is performed on IMF1 using uniform RLBP technique to obtain feature vector comprising of 59 unique elements. The dimensionality of features is reduced to 20 using Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). The subjects are classified using Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) classifier with different kernel functions and the classifier results are evaluated based on classifier performance measures. Analysis is performed on 43 healthy and 24 cancerous subjects chosen from DMR (Database of Mastology Research) database. The experimental results obtained by LSSVM classifier using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with ?2=3D0.5 and ?=3D1 outstands by achieving 89% accuracy. Hence the proposed system effectively distinguishes healthy and pathological subjects. © 2017 IEEE.",BEMD; IMF; LSSVM; RLBP; Thermogram,Diseases; Functions; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; International cooperation; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Anisotropic diffusion filtering; BEMD; International agency for research on cancers; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Least square support vector machines; LSSVM; RLBP; Thermogram; Medical imaging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Early diagnosis of cancer prevents morbidity and mortality rate. Thermography is an additional tool for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Low contrast, poor Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and complex breast boundaries are the inherent limitation of breast thermal images which makes segmentation a challenging task. In this work, an attempt is made to extract edge map from Type-I and Type-II breast images using Geometric Non linear Diffussion Filter (GNLDF) method to aid accurate segmentation. GNLDF is an iterative nonlinear filter which reduces the noise and preserves the edges based on the local image topology. The extracted edge maps are validated against the input images using betametric and Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD). Result showed that edge map extracted using GNLDF method is distinct for both types of images. The beta metric and GMSD values are found to be 0.29 and 0.004 indicating high resemblance of filtered image edges with the input images. GNLDF method has improved the SNR of Type-I and Type-II images by 35dB compared to Perona Malik method. Hence, the edge map extracted using GNLD filter shall aid accurate segmentation of breast tissue to identify pathology for clinical interpretation and diagnosis. © 2017 IEEE.",Beta metric; Breast thermography; GMSD and SNR; GNLDF; Perona Malik,Bandpass filters; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image processing; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Thermography (imaging); Beta metric; Breast boundary; Geometric non-linear; GMSD and SNR; GNLDF; Gradient magnitude; Inherent limitations; Perona Malik; Image enhancement,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Pseudo random noise (PRN), which is similar to noise and also fulfills a greater number of the standard tests for statistical randomness, can be used as a key for encryption. Using Legendre PN sequence which is based on prime numbers, an image encryption technique has been proposed in this paper. Based on the number of pixels in the image, Legendre sequences are generated for a set of prime numbers and concatenated to generate the required length sequence. This sequence is then used to encrypt the secret image that generates noise like pattern. This encrypted image is later embedded into a larger image using DCT technique to have double security. The proposed algorithm using Legendre sequence when tested on various images has always produced a PSNR value of cover image above 20, proving that changes made to cover image is very less. Identification of key to decrypt the original image is impossible to detect as multiple Legendre sequences are used to form PN sequence. Steganography with DCT adds to improvement in security. The above algorithm can be extended to color images and the robustness of the algorithm can be tested using different attacking methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Encryption; Legendre Sequence; Psuedo-Random Numbers,Image compression; Image processing; Random number generation; Encrypted images; Image encryptions; Legendre sequences; Original images; Pseudo-Random Noise; Random Numbers; Secret images; Standard tests; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Space-borne Hyperion data was acquired for two different dates (October, 2006 & January, 2011). Endmembers were picked up from highest percentage occupancy of a class. Classification was performed on a combination of bands coming from specific absorptive features of endmember spectra (VIS (458nm-702nm) and SWIR-I (1548nm-1780nm)). SFF & SAM were applied on two identified band combinations a) 25bands (VIS) & b) 49 bands (VIS+SWIR-I). SFF was performed on Continuum Removed (CR) spectra and SAM on Continuum Intact (CI) spectra. Overall accuracy (OAA) levels were different for the two band combinations, two algorithms and also for the two images. For October data, SFF gave 61% and 49% OAA using VIS+SWIR-1 bands and VIS bands respectively. The SAM classifier performed better for both the selected spectral regions (70% and 67% respectively). SAM showed better performance with 68% using VIS bands and SFF gave good OAA (56%) with VIS+SWIR-1 band combination for January data. Results indicate that OAA defers with changes in the phenology of vegetation cover. Endmember spectra worked well in classifying images coming from two different acquisition dates. © 2013 IEEE.",Band selection; Endmember extraction; Hyperion EO-1 data; Spectral Angle Mapper; Spectral Feature Fitting; Tropical Forest,Extraction; Forestry; Image processing; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Tropics; Band selection; Endmember extraction; Hyperion; Spectral angle mappers; Spectral feature fitting; Tropical forest; Data mining,,,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78151E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

But due to the busy schedule existing in present, often many of us forget to switch off lights and fans which increase wastage of electricity. Often we find lights and fans in the classroom will be on though the classroom is empty which increases the electricity bill. This is the major issue in most of the educational institutions. Over the past decade, there has been significant advancement and innovations in the field of consumer electronics by using new technologies we can automate the control of main power supply provided to the classroom which significantly reduces the power consumption. Automation provides some sort of automatic control to the electrical appliances present in the building.

We have proposed a novel framework for automatic segmentation of tumor using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) technique. This approach generates super pixels and thus reduces number of regions in the segmentation. Reduced number of regions will minimize the complexity of further processing steps. The noise in the image has to be minimal for the better accuracy. For this purpose we have used median filtering as a part of the pre-processing before going for super pixel generation. Preprocessing includes noise removal and image filtering steps with resizing the images. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Histogram features are utilized for components estimation which helps for the collection of feature vectors. Finally Hamming Distance is used for validating whether a particular region is tumor or not.

In recent years, various digital image processing techniques are developed. Computer Vision, machine interfaces, manufacturing industry, data compression for storage, vehicle tracking and many more are some of the domains of digital image processing application. In most of the cases, digital biomedical images contains various types of noise, artifacts etc. and are not useful for direct applications. Before using it in any process, the input image has to be gone through some preprocessing stages; such preprocessing is generally called as image enhancement. In this work, a new technique has been proposed to enhance biomedical images using modified cuckoo search algorithm and morphological operation. Presence of noise and other unwanted objects generates distortion in an image and it will affect the ultimate result of the process. In case of biomedical images, accuracy of the results is very important. It may also decrease the discernibility of many features inside the images. It can affect the classification accuracy. In this work, this issue has been targeted and improved by obtaining better contrast value after converting the color image into grayscale image. The basic property of the cuckoo search algorithm is that the amplitudes of its components are capable to objectively describe the contribution of the gray levels to the formation of image information for the best contrast value of a digital image. The proposed method modified the conventional cuckoo search method by employing the McCulloch's method for levy flight generation. After computing the best contrast value, morphological operation has been applied. In morphological operation based phase, the intensity parameters are tuned for quality enhancement. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of this work. © 2017 IEEE.",biomedical imaging; image enhancement; Modified cuckoo search; morphological operations,Bioinformatics; Digital image storage; Digital storage; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Manufacturing data processing; Mathematical morphology; Medical imaging; Optimization; Biomedical imaging; Classification accuracy; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Digital image processing technique; Intensity parameters; Manufacturing industries; Morphological operations; Image enhancement,,Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Ind.

Due to the availability of multimedia reconstruction and editing tools, multimedia authentication gained a considerable attention. Some authentication is to be performed during the transmission of data via insecure networks. Data encryption is one of the frequently used method for secure data transmission. A great demand has arisen for checking the visual security of the encrypted images of low quality. None of the metrics perform well for low quality encrypted images. A novel visual security index (VSI) is used to measure the visual security of perceptually encrypted images of low quality. Here edge, texture and wavelet based frequency information of both plain and encrypted image is used. Initially the edge information is extracted using canny edge detector. Then, texture information is extracted using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Finally, 2D DWT of both plain and encrypted image is calculated.

Apart from the planting multiple tea varieties, growth of natural vegetation species is common scenario in plantations. The objective of this research was spectral discrimination of nine important tea varieties in the presence of six natural vegetation species in Munnar, Western Ghat highlands of south India. Discrimination models using six methods: k-nearest neighborhood classifier (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), normalized spectral similarity score (NS3), maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied on the hyperspectral reflectance measurements collected at canopy level. The existence and statistical significance of spectral differences of the tea and natural vegetation species were assessed by MANOVA. Results indicate that six out of 9 tea varieties could be discriminated with best accuracies 75 to 80%. While a closer spectral similarity is observed in few tea varieties, the presence of natural vegetation species has decreased inter species variability for few tea varieties while enhancing the same for few other tea varieties at the cost of reducing spectral separability among the vegetation species. © 2014 IEEE.",classification; hyperspectral species level discrimination; MANOVA; spectral matching; Tea plantations,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Image processing; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Vegetation; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral reflectance; Linear discriminant analysis; MANOVA; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Spectral matchings; Statistical significance; Tea plantations; Signal processing,"Nidamanuri, R.R.; Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: rao@iist.ac.in",,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78147E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

In this paper an Adaptive Decision based filtering method is proposed for removing impulse noise mainly salt & pepper noise. The proposed algorithm first detect the noisy pixel, then filtering is done using decision based algorithm. The filter works very well on removing fixed valued impulse noise. With little increase in computational complexity over basic median filter, these algorithms works well on different noise ratios. This paper also proposes hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm for real time execution. Implementations are checked on Artix-7 FPGA development board of XC7A100T-1csg324c device family using VHDL programming language in vivado 2015 design tools.

It is still challenging problem in computer vision key area. The existing methodologies for image categorization like semantic modelling approaches, neural network approaches does not provides an accurate solution. This is due to inefficient feature extraction and their processing. Deep Learning is a new and emerging subfield in machine learning research. It consist of a set of algorithms that attempt to learn features using multiple layers where each layer represents higher level of abstraction of lower layers. The acceptance of deep learning concept is due to unsupervised and scalable nature of it. Manifold regularized deep learning architecture extracts the structural information of the input image which leads to better classification. Primarily low level features of an input image is obtained by SURF algorithm. This is inputted into DBN architecture to formulate high level features.

The demand for such a high computational requirement is often met by using software methods to accelerate the computation, which is possible only to a certain extent, impairing the feasibility of real-time imaging and diagnosis. In this paper, a new method of using digital signal processors (DSPs) with a specialized pipelined vision processor (PVP) embedded at the hardware level to accelerate the routinely time-consuming imaging computation is proposed and validated. A lab prototype is built for the feasibility study and clinical validation of the proposed technique. This unique architecture of the PVP in a dual-core DSP offers a high-performance accelerated framework along with its large on-chip memory resources, and reduced bandwidth requirement provides as an ideal architecture for reliable medical computational needs. We have taken two sets sample studies from SPECT for validation - 27 cases of thyroid medical history and 20 cases of glomerular filtration rate of kidneys.

The proposed scheme is applied for secure medical information transmission or its cloud storage. The scheme is implemented in two steps. In first step, randomization of patient information is done based on a password secret key before embedding it into the cover medical image. Second step is to hide the watermarked image into a secret key image before cloud storage so that even if the stored image is hacked or leaked, the cover medical image along with embedded patient information cannot be retrieved by the hacker. In this paper we have proposed a novel watermarking algorithm for medical images by randomizing the information according to the secret password key and then embedding it into the cover medical image followed by embedding of cover image into another secret key image. The proposed scheme aims to protect sensitive information transfer and cloud storage from unauthorized access. Extraction of the embedded information at the receiver end is done in two steps. Firstly, non-blind detection is carried out in which cover medical image is extracted with help of secret key image. In the second step, binary image watermark is extracted by analyzing the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient values. Performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by varying the quality factor of JPEG compression and sub-band decomposition levels. © 2017 IEEE.",Block DCT; Data hiding; DWT domain watermarking; Medical image processing,Access control; Authentication; Binary images; Cryptography; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Image processing; Image watermarking; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Personal computing; Signal processing; Block DCT; Data hiding; Embedded information; Sensitive informations; Subband decomposition; Unauthorized access; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking schemes; Image compression,,Herencsar N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Classification of the ground surface into several classes facilitate in understanding the changes caused by climate, natural and human activities. For this purpose, hyperspectral images provide high spectral information. Due to poor spatial resolution the IFOV of the sensor contains many classes and the spectra obtained are often mixture of two classes. This results in misclassification. In this paper, sub-pixel analysis of hyperspectral images is carried out to deal with the mixed pixel problem. We propose a technique based on Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) which utilizes the spectral information to generate spatially high resolution images.

Level set methods and active contour models (ACMs) plays a vital role in the applications of image processing, robot vision, object recognition and computer vision. DRLSE model has recently become a powerful technique for image segmentation. DRLSE model eliminates the re-initialization problem in conventional level set method. DRLSE has been applied successfully into some fields like medical imaging, remote sensing and computer vision. However when it is applied to noisy images, It leads to significant drawbacks (number of iterations and computational time is increased). In order to avoid disadvantages of conventional DRLSE, we introduce a method to combine the median filtering, k-means clustering and DRLSE model. Firstly a noise free image is extracted by median filtering; then k-means clustering is applied to denoised image. The last stage is that the DRLSE model is applied for the extraction of object boundaries with pre segmentation process. The accuracy and the efficiency of the algorithm can be described on various noisy magnetic resonance (MR) brain images.

Still the exact cause of the breast cancer remain unknown. Early detection and diagnosis is the best and most effective strategy to control the tumor progression. Mammography is the currently recommended imaging method for early determination and diagnosis of breast malignancy. A mammogram can identify abnormal areas in the breast that look like a cancer but turns out to be normal, this leads to false positive. Mammogram images are found to be difficult to interpret so a CAD is becoming an increasingly important tool to assist radiologist in the mammographic lesion interpretation. Preprocessing was considered as an important step in mammogram image analysis. Accuracy of preprocessing will determine the success of the remaining process such as segmentation, classification etc. In this paper, mean, median, adaptive median, Gaussian and wiener denoising filters are used to remove salt and pepper, speckle and Gaussian noises from a mammogram image and these filters were compared based on the parameters such as PSNR, MSE and SNR to determine which filter is better for removing these noises in mammogram images. © 2017 IEEE.",Adaptive median filter; CAD; Gaussian filter; Mammogram; Mean filter; Median filter; MSE; Preprocessing; PSNR; SNR; wiener filter,Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Computer aided design; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Image segmentation; Mammography; Medical imaging; X ray screens; Adaptive median filter; Gaussian filters; Mammogram; Mean filter; Preprocessing; PSNR; WIENER filters; Median filters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Conf.

In contrast, proper formulation of the problem so that the task of quality assessment of an image can be performed automatically, is a complex task and hence, designing objective No-Reference (NR) quality measurement algorithms is indeed very difficult. Existing approaches identify the degradation from among a set of degradations commonly experienced during image transmission and handling. However, apart from the inadequacy of being unable to indicate the amount of degradation they tend to reflect the overall degradation rather than being sensitive to one kind of degradation. The problem of correctly assessing the level of degradation is crucial since the choice of an appropriate restoration technique is heavily dependent on this. Further, in practical situations, the problem is compounded by the presence of other degradations acting as confounding factors such as noise. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it is designed to work well in situations where JPEG compressed images have been subjected to noise. Its performance has been tested through simulations on a large number of images from several popular databases. Results have also been compared with those obtained from subjective tests on the same images. © 2017 IEEE.",,Image analysis; Image processing; Signal processing; Distorted images; Human observers; JPEG compressed images; No references; Original images; Quality assessment; Quality measurements; Restoration techniques; Image quality,,Struc V.Kovacic S.Kristan M.Loncaric S.Vucic M.,IEEE Computer Society,18455921,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this scenario, developing generalised algorithms which gives a freedom to user in choosing the trade-off between quality and quick response is a challenging task. In this paper a novel boundary detection algorithm for segregating similar coloured objects in an image is presented, which accommodates a degree of freedom in choosing resolution of object detection to the detection time. This method uses colour based segmentation as preprocessing technique to reduce overall computational complexity. It is independent of the shape (convex or non-convex) and size of the object.

This mainly corresponds to the bulk of information which was easily embedded on each hyperspectral image. A large number of kernel based techniques were formulated and used in this regard. Since the dimension of the hyperspectral image (HSI) is very large, conventional image processing and classification methods does not have an emphasizing effect on feature extraction. This paper compares the performance of various classification algorithms such as kernel based methods implemented using LibSVM and GURLS and sparsity based algorithm known as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The assessment is done based on HSI classification accuracy. The experiment is conducted on standard dataset namely Indian Pines procured by the AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer). These algorithms can handle the entire dimensionality by taking the total number of classes into account, to retain information potential and effectively differentiate classes with sharp spectral differences.

The classification is done using Random Kitchen Sink which is accessed through GURLS library and also classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The experimental evaluation of sparse banded matrix filter is done on a standard face database (Yale). Edge detection is the process of locating the sharp discontinuity in an image. It is a basic tool which is used in many image processing applications such as face recognition. In this paper, we have compared the performance of sparse banded matrix filter with existing edge detecting filters such as Sobel, Prewitt, Canny and Robert. Though many filters exist for edge detection, sparse banded matrix filter is known for the edge detection with minimal discontinuity. The experimental evaluation shows that the edge feature descriptors of Yale face database obtained using sparse banded matrix filter provides 88 % accuracy using GURLS and 81% using SVM. © 2017 IEEE.",AB Filter; Edge Features; Face Recognition; GURLS; LibSVM,Bandpass filters; Computer circuits; Edge detection; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Support vector machines; AB Filter; Edge features; Experimental evaluation; Feature descriptors; GURLS; Image processing applications; LibSVM; Sparse banded matrix; Face recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Initially, the method is applied on synthetically generated blood vessels of normal, moderate and severely tortuous nature. Then retinal vessels are segmented using image processing methods. Small vessel segments are selected manually and used for tortuosity evaluation. These images are collected from local eye hospital, DRIVE database and VICAVR database.

School of Engineering and Management, Bangalore, India","In this paper, we present a new approach to reduce the computational complexity of pattern verification and identification through the process of automatically partitioning the existing image feature vector set into highly relative clusters based on the Optimized Agglomerative Clustering (OAC) technique. The proposed approach consists of two tiers: clustering and matching. In the first tier, the entire trained images feature vector set is automatically divided into distinct number of clusters based on the OAC. Then, the range of centroids minimum and maximum calculate over each individual cluster in the resulting cluster based on the proposed Min-Max Centroid Measure (MMCM). In the second tier, a new matching technique called Two-Level Matching (TLM) is also proposed. TLM aims to match the test image feature vector over the related trained image feature vectors in the specific cluster through two levels. In the first level, TLM verifies the test image feature vector is valid by mapping the centroid of test image feature vector over the range of centroids (Min&Max) of each individual cluster. In the second level, the TLM maps the valid test image feature vector among the related existing image feature vectors in the specific cluster and generates the matching result. The proposed approach reduces the time complexity of image feature vector identification and improves accuracy of the image feature vector matching. The experiment results show that the proposed approach is faster and improves image recognition in both verification and identification scenarios.

Detection of brain tumor has become a challenging task to compete with. In this paper an automated method for detecting brain abnormalities and tumor edema has been proposed using sobel edge detection method. Various MRI images have been used as inputs here. Here, first of all the pre-processing of image has been done to cut out any discrepancy in it and then the image has been smoothened using median filter. We have proposed an appropriate method to find threshold value using standard deviation and we get an intensity map. Now we recomputed standard deviation for this intensity map. Using this we will calculate an average intensity of the pixels those are above this standard deviation. Finally, this computed average intensity will be taken as the threshold value to segment the tumor from the original MRI images. The intensity value greater than and equal to the calculated threshold value is set to 255 and less than is set to 0, this segments our abnormal region which is tumor. At last, we use sobel edge detector to identify the border of the tumor region. The outcome of the proposed method improves efficacy and accuracy for detection of brain tumors. © 2017 IEEE.",Average Intensity; MRI Images; Sobel Operator; Standard Deviation; Tumor Detection,Brain; Computer circuits; Edge detection; Image processing; Image segmentation; Median filters; Statistics; Tumors; Average Intensity; MRI Image; Sobel operator; Standard deviation; Tumor detection; Magnetic resonance imaging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Most of the muscles in the palmar region of the hand are intrinsic, and hence noninvasive EMG measurements give minimal information. In this study, an attempt is made to quantify the variations in thermal profile of the hand pre- and post- fatigue using infrared thermography. Subjects are tested using pinch grip based isometric contraction of the hand until fatigue. Baseline and post-fatigue thermal images are acquired using a Meditherm IRIS infrared camera. The process of image segmentation is carried out to delineate the dominant hand from the background. Features such as average temperature and kurtosis are extracted from the segmented images. Results show that there are wide variations in the intensities depicted by the thermal profile of each subject's hand. A decrease of 1.22% in median hand temperature of the palmar hand is observed. Similarly, a 1.17% reduction in temperature of the dorsal hand is detected post-fatigue. The kurtosis of the thermal profiles increases by 5.39% in the palmar hand and 6.63% in the dorsal hand post-fatigue. The statistical Student T-test performed on these features indicate that the decrease in average temperature is non-statistically significant (P>0.05); however, the increase in kurtosis is statistically significant (P<0.05). Infrared thermography appears to be a promising tool to measure the state of activation of muscle groups using thermal profiles.",Fatigue; Image processing; Infrared thermography; Upper Extremity Musculoskeletal Disorder,Bioinformatics; Diseases; Ergonomics; Fatigue of materials; Higher order statistics; Image processing; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; EMG measurement; Infra-red cameras; Isometric contractions; Minimal information; Segmented images; Student t tests; Thermal profiles; Upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders; Thermography (imaging),,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

The images plays an vital role in examining the patients trouble. While examining, the image comprises of more noises. These noises are the major factor affecting the quality of the image which has greatly impeded people from extracting the useful information from the image. In order to overcome this kind of obstacle we apply image denoising. The main intension of image denoising is to restore the original image without noise from the noising image and also the same time to maintain the detailed information of the image as much as possible. In this paper, we provide the combination of cuckoo search algorithm and artificial neural network where the noise in the image can be filtered and removed effectively using adaptive non-linear Zernike filter. The simulation result shows that the algorithm proposed in this paper can maintain the edges of the images and other important features while removing the noise, so as to obtain better denoising affect.

It is widely used in image processing, video surveillance, cyber forensic, video browsing, and video indexing and retrieval applications. Though the state-of-the art computer vision algorithms provide efficient solutions for extraction of key frames, but often demands very high computational power as it involves computing very high dimensional image features. On the other hand, with the widespread use of Big Data and IOT applications, the storage, management and accessing of large volume, high velocity and variety of video data is increasing at exponential rates. Therefore, in order to address this problem we propose optimization of key frame extraction algorithms on Apache Hadoop distributed framework. As the process of extracting key-frames involves simultaneous execution of image processing tasks, the Hadoop framework divides and distributes these tasks to multiple nodes of the cluster. The MapReduce programming model has been redefined to perform the tasks of identifying key frames by color histogram difference between successive frames. The proposed optimized Hadoop's MapReduce algorithm has been tested on a data set of 1000 news videos each having approximately a length of 10 minutes. A performance speed up of 7 has been achieved by varying the size of the cluster from 1 node to 10 nodes. © 2017 IEEE.",Color Histogram; Hadoop; Key Frame Extraction; MapReduce,Big data; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Extraction; Graphic methods; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Optimization; Security systems; Color histogram; Computer vision algorithms; Hadoop; High-dimensional images; Key-frame extraction; Map-reduce; Map-reduce programming; Video indexing and retrieval; Image processing,"Deshmane, P.; B.V.B CETIndia; email: deshmane.praveen@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The detection & recognition of a face in an image using template matching is one of the profound research interest in the field of image processing. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to extract the visual facial features based on texture, color, shape, sketch & pose variance etc. for face detection in color images. This paper describes an approach of face detection technique that includes major characteristics such as lightening compensation based on luminance (Y) & chrominance (Cr), Color segmentation, skin-tone statistics & eye-mouth region computation. A template matching algorithm using cross correlation method for locating & recognizing a face has been applied on various face candidates to match the template with right face candidate.

Smart traffic monitoring involves real-time traffic scene analysis from CCTV cameras to detect and identify stalled vehicles and measure traffic density on roads. The scene analysis essentially necessitates tracking and counting the number of moving and stopped vehicles as they progress along the image sequence by utilizing computer vision techniques. The obtained features along with manually annotated traffic data are translated to a higher level information using semantic web technologies, thus providing a common platform to exchange the information. As the perceptual modelling of traffic data involves media patterns so we have employed Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) for the semantic interpretation and to tackle inherent uncertainties involved in these media documents. MOWL supports hierarchical probabilistic reasoning framework and utilizes time-varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) to perform semantic comparison and predict the evolution of changing situations. In this paper, we discuss the key tasks of vision and probabilistic reasoning components that provide a feasible solution to identify the cause of traffic jam. The proposed approach can be used to trigger an automatic warning or alerts to traffic authorities in case any anomalous activity is encountered and guide users to take some different route to avoid jam.

Authenticity of the digital image is very important in the area of scientific research, forensic investigations, government documents, etc. With the help of powerful and user friendly image editing software like Microsoft Paint and Photoshop it became extremely easy to tamper with a digital image for malicious objective. Of late this problem has been encountered in medical imaging also for the purpose of fake insurance claims. We propose an algorithm to address this problem by which one can detect and localize tampering in a digital medical image. This algorithm is based on hash based representation of such image and uses discrete wavelet transform method to carry out detection and localization of tampering. We will show that our algorithm is robust against harmless manipulation and sensitive enough for even a minute tampering. Our proposed technique consumes less resource as it works with smaller hash function in comparison with the similar available techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",discrete wavelet transform; Image forensic; image hashing; tampering detection; tampering localization,Authentication; Digital forensics; Discrete wavelet transforms; Hash functions; Image compression; Image processing; Insurance; Signal reconstruction; Smart city; Wavelet transforms; Detection and localization; Digital medical images; Forensic investigation; Image editing software; Image forensics; Image hashing; Tampering detection; Tampering localizations; Medical imaging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

In this paper, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image compression system for such airborne vehicles is proposed. The proposed system employs the concepts of steganography and discrete wavelet transform, thus achieving the best of both worlds. A novel attempt is made in this work to compress several SAR images and conceal them in an electro-optic (EO) image captured on-board, before transmitting it to image receiving ground station. The proposed system is evaluated using different wavelets and the results are reported. It is observed that the reconstructed SAR images have PSNR ranging from 31.94-62.72 dB and the PSNR of stego-image ranges from 60.20-70.62 dB with nine SAR images concealed in it.

But, when considering technology that is deployed in this field, we find that the development is not tremendous. After consulting with the Kerala Agricultural University, Mannuthy and Kerala Rice Research Station, Vytilla, we identified a few fundamental issues that are faced by the paddy farmers today. It includes the problem of over or under watering and the need for regular manual irrigation. Furthermore, when it comes to rice, which is the staple crop of Kerala, there does not exist a system for automatically monitoring the diseases associated with the rice species, and checking whether the crop is supplied with ample amount of nutrients. In this paper, we have devised a means for cost-effective automated irrigation and fertigation along with MATLAB based image processing for identifying the rice diseases and nutrient deficiencies. Here, we are focusing on two important nutrients, namely magnesium and nitrogen. The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and solenoid valves. Furthermore, the proposed model enables the farmer to monitor weather conditions using an Android Application, with which he also has a choice to override the system if required. © 2017 IEEE.",Agriculture; Automation; Image Processing; Irrigation; Nutrient Detection; Water Management,Agriculture; Automation; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Image processing; Internet of things; Irrigation; Smart city; Solenoid valves; Water management; Android applications; Cost effective; Disease analysis; Fertigations; Irrigation systems; Nutrient deficiency; Research stations; Temperature and humidity sensor; Nutrients,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

The human faces may be obstructed by other object that makes the acquisition of fully holistic image processing as a complex task. To overcome this problem, a new partial face recognition system is introduced in this paper. This work includes the preprocessing, face detection, feature extraction and classification tasks. At first, the given face image is preprocessed by using the Gaussian filtering technique, which efficiently removes the noise and smoothens the image. Then, the Viola Jones algorithm is implemented to detect the face from the filtered image. Here, the Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) technique is employed to extract the features for better classification.

This paper proposes a new image fusion method based on Dual Tree-Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT), and Curvelet transform for remotely sensed lunar image data in order to extract features accurately. Different fusion techniques have been used in the past separately for spatial and spectral quality image enhancement. In this study, we use a new image fusion technique based on Dual Tree - Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and Curvelet transforms. Results indicate that the fused lunar image shows good spatial fidelity and the spectral resolution of the fused product was preserved after image data fusion. It is seen that 95.98% of the spectral content is preserved by curvelet fusion. From the results of statistical evaluation parameters demonstrated for the two study sites, it is found that curvelet transform gives better results than the other techniques commonly used. © 2017 IEEE.",Curvelet Transform; DT-CWT; Image Fusion; Lunar Image; Multi Sensor,Data fusion; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image processing; Moon; Partial discharges; Sensor data fusion; Spectral resolution; Trees (mathematics); Wavelet transforms; Curvelet transforms; DT-CWT; Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT); High spatial resolution images; High spectral resolution images; Lunar Image; Multi sensor; Multisensor image fusion; Image fusion,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

All the methods of image inpainting start with a selection of the area which is needed to be inpainted. However, this selection of area or mask is to be done manually as there is no way for a machine to identify it. The process of creation of mask is cumbersome and time consuming and requires human expertise. Using image segmentation, the image can be divided into probable areas of inpainting and then the user can select area/s to generate the mask accurately and easily. In this paper we present a method to do selection of segments to generate mask which is further used to inpaint the image using exemplar based inpainting algorithm. The proposed scheme greatly reduces the overall inpainting time by drastically reducing the manual work of drawing the mask. Comparative results of masking object manually and by using proposed method are shown. Subjective analysis of inpainting using proposed method of masking and manual masking shows the effectiveness of the same. © 2017 IEEE.",Exemplar based Image inpainting; JSEG; Segmentation,Image segmentation; Area of interest; Exemplar-based; Human expertise; Image Inpainting; Inpainting; JSEG; Semi-automatics; Subjective analysis; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Remote sensing images from tropical regions are partially unusable especially because of the presence of clouds. For improving the accuracy of land cover classification in satellite images cloud detection is useful. The major obstacle in cloud detection approach is the misclassification rate of cloud pixels. In this paper novel cloud detection from satellite image based on stationary Haar wavelet is presented. The proposed approach uses wavelet transform, histogram analysis and clustering for cloud detection. Remote sensing satellite images can be considered as a signal. Clouds are low frequency components in satellite image. So wavelet analysis of satellite images is helpful to extract low frequency components and detection of clouds.

It can start in the breast and can spread to other areas of the body in the course of time. Breast cancer is the second largest disease leading to the death of women. The disease is curable if detected early enough. A lot of research is being done to detect the cancer at the earliest. Early detection at the microcalcification stage can be useful for providing proper treatment at the early stage and saving the patients. Research on breast cancer using digital image processing is not new but lack of proper methods for early detection at microcalcification stage is still a challenge to medical domain and still it is considered as the deadliest. Most of the research work done till now detects the breast cancer at tumor stage and are not accurate to 100% and leads to false positive or false negative results which are highly dangerous. And also they do not provide end to end solution. A novel methodology is proposed in this paper using a combination of different highly efficient techniques of digital image processing which are not yet being implemented in this research area. Using the methodology proposed in this paper it is possible to detect the breast cancer at a very early microcalcification stage itself and the result of this proposed methodology will be of very high accuracy leading to true positive and true negative results.

Most of the traditional algorithms such as AES and DES are computationally intensive. Hence, in this paper we propose a simple but secure symmetric key encryption algorithm. The image encryption approach makes use of two pseudorandom number generators to encrypt images. Middle Square Algorithm is used to swap the columns of the image followed by the swapping of the rows. This permutation step produces the intermediary cipher image. Subsequently, RC4 algorithm is used to produce a stream of pseudo-random numbers. These numbers are used to substitute the intensity of pixels of the intermediary cipher image, which gives the final encrypted image. Various analysis tests are performed on the quality of the encrypted image. The results of these tests prove that the proposed algorithm is secure and efficient. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptography; Image Decryption; Image Encryption; Middle Square; Pseudo Random Number; RC4,Image processing; Number theory; Quality control; Random number generation; Security of data; Encryption algorithms; Image decryptions; Image encryption algorithm; Image encryptions; Middle Square; Pseudo random number generators; Pseudo-random numbers; Symmetric key encryption algorithm; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Most modern day face recognition systems can be fooled by this process, as the perceptual information contained in a photo-of-a-photo, is virtually the same as that of a natural photograph of an individual. Current solutions attempt to detect this form of planar-spoofing through an extrinsic training process wherein both planar samples as well as regular photos are included as separate training sets. To avoid this form of explicit discriminant model-learning, we propose a single class training procedure for establishing and quantifying the quality of natural photographs taken under different lighting conditions, in terms of their CONTRAST PROFILE. Once this distribution is learnt, a suitable threshold is set based on the mean and standard deviation to pick up outliers.

The method includes, the original image is decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components by HWT I. Then, the low-frequency coefficients is enhanced using CLAHE and the high-frequency coefficients kept unchanged to limit noise enhancement. Finally, the image is reconstructed by taking inverse HWT of the new coefficients. In order to counteract over-enhancement, the recreated and original images are averaged using an originally proposed weighting factor. Two orthogonal transforms combine to form a hybrid wavelet. Here different orthogonal transforms are used like Kekre, Walsh, Cosine, Hartley and Haar in 5 × 4 combinations total 20 hybrid wavelets of type I.

Proposed research presents an image enhancement method, named CLAHE-HWT, which combines the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) with Hybrid Wavelet Transform Type I and II (HWT I, II). The method includes, the original image is decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components by HWT II. Then, we enhance the low-frequency coefficients using CLAHE and keep the high-frequency coefficients unchanged to limit noise enhancement. Finally, reconstruct the image by taking inverse HWT of the new coefficients. In order to counteract over-enhancement, the recreated and original images are averaged using an originally proposed weighting factor. Two orthogonal transforms combine to form a hybrid wavelet. Here different orthogonal transforms are used like Kekre, Walsh, Cosine, Hartley and Haar in 5 × 4 combinations total 20 hybrid wavelets of type II. This research compares all the 20 combinations of HWT I and 20 HWT II to find out the best combination of HWT with CLAHE.

Copy-move tampering is most generally used by attackers in which object of another image is copy and paste in original image in nearly matching areas. Hence to identify such image threats, it is required to automatic computer vision based method which can classify whether input digital image is original or tampered.

When an image of information is converted from one form to another using a commonly available process such as digitizing, scanning, transmitting, storing, the performance of the transformed image gets degraded up to some extent. Thus it is found that the quality of transformed image can be improved with the process of image enhancement technique. Consequently, very few methods are developed in diagnosing the lesions on ultrasound modality. Inspired by a neural network (NN), a system for image quality enhancement using the deep belief neural network is proposed. The statistical characteristics of image textures are determined from the noisy environment using the impact of entropy and autocorrelation features. In addition to that, the impact of skewness factor on image assessment is measured using the alignment problem to be considered.

A standard result in this regard is that the least-square formulation of the registration problem admits a closed-form solution for two point sets. However, since the group of rigid transforms is not convex, solving the least-square optimization for multiple point sets is computationally challenging. It was recently demonstrated that the least-square formulation can be relaxed into a tractable semidefinite program, and that the relaxation is provably tight under certain assumptions. The difficulty is that standard solvers for semidefinite programming (e.g., interior-point solvers) cannot be scaled to handle large-sized problems. In this letter, we propose an iterative solver based on variable splitting and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Since each iteration essentially involves an eigendecomposition, the proposed solver can be scaled to problems that are beyond the reach of interior-point solvers.

Assessment and management of such wound is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Currently, precise wound bed estimation depends on the clinical judgment and remains a difficult task. The paper introduces a novel method for ulcer boundary demarcation and estimation, using optical images captured by a hand-held digital camera. The proposed approach involves gray based fuzzy similarity measure using spatial knowledge of an image. The fuzzy measure is used to construct similarity matrix. The best color channel was chosen by calculating the mean contrast for 26 different color channels of 14 color spaces. It was found that Db color channel has highest mean contrast which provide best segmentation result in comparison with other color channels. The fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) method was applied on Db color channel for effective delineation of wound region. The segmented wound regions were effectively post-processed using various morphological operations. The performance of proposed segmentation technique was validated by ground-truth images labeled by two experienced dermatologists and a surgeon. The FSC approach was tested on 70 images. FSC effectively segmented targeted ulcer boundary yielding 91.5% segmentation accuracy, 86.7%, Dice index and 79.0%. Jaccard score. The sensitivity and specificity was found to be 87.3% and 95.7% respectively. The performance evaluation shows the robustness of the proposed method of wound area segmentation and its potential to be used for designing patient comfort centric wound care system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chronic wound; Color constancy; Digital image processing; Fuzzy similarity measure; Segmentation; Spectral clustering,"Clustering algorithms; Color; Dermatology; Diseases; Fuzzy logic; Geometrical optics; Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Optical data processing; Physiological models; Chronic wounds; Color constancy; Fuzzy similarity measure; Morphological operations; Performance evaluations; Segmentation techniques; Sensitivity and specificity; Spectral clustering; Image segmentation; adult; aged; Article; chronic wound; clinical evaluation; color; contrast; controlled study; decision making; evaluation study; female; fuzzy system; health care system; human; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; major clinical study; male; noise reduction; patient comfort; priority journal; ulcer; wound care; clinical trial; decubitus; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; image processing; injury; multicenter study; procedures; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Pressure Ulcer; Wounds and Injuries","Chakraborty, C.; School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: chandanc@smst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,28479109,English,Comput.

The popular transforms such as discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) provide decent EC; however, their capability is not enough to deliver good quality image reconstruction for higher compression levels (CLs). In this study, the authors propose a new hybrid transform which is a fusion of wavelet packet transform (WPT) and block-DCT (BDCT) transform to achieve high-quality image compression. This new hybrid WPT-BDCT transform is able to attain higher EC than the existing transforms. Further, the authors have found a new energy compaction index (ECI) to evaluate the energy compactness of the image transforms. The proposed hybrid transform has been extensively evaluated, based on proposed ECI parameter, the visual quality assessment of reconstructed images and with the standard image quality indexes peak-signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure. It is reported that the proposed hybrid transform provides higher EC and outperforms the transforms namely DCT, DWT, WPT, multi-wavelet transform and existing hybrid transforms for all the CLs. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Compaction; Cosine transforms; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image coding; Image processing; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Quality control; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; Compression performance; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); High quality image compression; Multi wavelet transforms; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity index measures; Visual quality assessment; Wavelet packet transform(WPT); Image compression,"Thakur, K.; S.O.S. in Electronics and Photonics, Pt.

The recognition system is applied for representation, recognition of generic visual features, and classification of different species based on their phenotype appearances, the morphological image pattern, and biometric characteristics. The muzzle point image pattern is a primary animal biometric characteristic for the recognition of individual cattle. It is similar to the identification of minutiae points in human fingerprints. This study presents an automatic recognition algorithm of muzzle point image pattern of cattle for the identification of individual cattle, verification of false insurance claims, registration, and traceability process. The proposed recognition algorithm uses the texture feature descriptors, such as speeded up robust features and local binary pattern for the extraction of features from the muzzle point images at different smoothed levels of Gaussian pyramid. The feature descriptors acquired at each Gaussian smoothed level are combined using fusion weighted sum-rule method. With a muzzle point image pattern database of 500 cattle, the proposed algorithm yields the desired level of 93.87% identification accuracy.

This paper presents a feature extraction approach that aims at extracting texture features present in the medical images using Local Pattern Descriptor (LPD) and Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). As a main contribution, a novel local pattern named Local Mesh Vector Co-occurrence Pattern (LMVCoP) has been proposed by concatenating the Local Mesh Co-occurrence Pattern (LMCoP) and the Local Vector Co-occurrence Pattern (LVCoP). The fusion of GLCM with the Local Mesh Pattern (LMeP) and the Local Vector Pattern (LVP) produces LMCoP and LVCoP respectively. The LMVCoP method has been investigated on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain image database. LMVCoP descriptor achieves 87.57% of ARP and 53.21% of ARR which are higher than the existing methods of LTCoP, PVEP, LBDP, LMeP and LVP.

For the extraction of local edge features from both the sketch and photo images, a new local feature called local gradient checksum (LGCS) has been developed. LGCS is a modality reduction local edge feature on gradient domain. It is calculated as the summation of four pairs of gradient differences between two local pixels that are at 180° with each other. The Euclidean distance between query sketch and gallery of photos are measured depending on extracted LGCS features. To further improve the result, a multi-scale LGCS is proposed. A rank-1 accuracy of 100 % is achieved in a gallery of 606 photos consisting of CUHK, AR, and XM2VTS face dataset. The proposed face sketch-photo recognition system requires neither learning procedures nor training data. Further, the experiment is extended to test the robustness of the proposed algorithm on blurred, noisy and disguised sketches, as well as photos. Under those situations also, LGCS has outperformed center-symmetric local binary pattern, directional local extrema pattern and weber local descriptor feature extraction techniques. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Checksum; FSPR-system; Gradient-face; LGCS; MLGCS,Extraction; Face recognition; Center-symmetric local binary patterns; Check sums; Feature extraction techniques; FSPR-system; Learning procedures; LGCS; MLGCS; Recognition systems; Image processing,"Roy, H.; RCC Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: hiranmoy.roy@rcciit.org",,Springer Verlag,18688071,,,,English,Intl.

In this scheme, we partition the original cover image into (7 × 7) pixel block and adjust redundant LSB bits of each row using odd parity. Then we calculate secret position ? = (? mod 7) + 1, where ? is a shared secret key. The bit at position ? and a suitable location for hidden message bit is modified through error creation caused by tamper in each row of the selected block. For the next row, the ? is updated by the data embedding position (?) of the previous row. We repeat this process to embed secret message bits within the selected block. For each new block, the ? is updated by ?i+1 = (?i × ? × ?) mod 7 + 1, where i = 0, 1, 2, 3,.. , number of blocks. At the receiver end, we complement the bit at position ? then retrieve the secret message bit by applying Hamming error correcting code. The extraction process will be stopped when we find continuous no error within stego image. The propose PRDHHC scheme extract the hidden message successfully and recover hamming adjusted cover image by complement bits at both the ? and ? positions but can not recover original cover image, that is to say, our scheme is partial reversible. Finally, we compared our scheme with other state-of-the-art methods and obtained reasonably better performance in terms of visual quality (measured by PSNR).

Inability of the heart to restore normal perfusion to the entire body refers to cardiac failure, which then with symptoms results in manifestation of congestive heart failure (CHF). Impairment in systolic function associated with chronic dilation of left ventricle is referred as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The clinical examination, surface electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, blood markers and echocardiography play major role in the diagnosis of CHF. Though the ECG manifests chamber enlargement changes, it does not possess sensitive marker for the diagnosis of DCM, whereas echocardiographic assessment can effectively reveal the presence of asymptomatic DCM. This work proposes an automated screening method for classifying normal and CHF echocardiographic images affected due to DCM using variational mode decomposition technique. The texture features are extracted from variational mode decomposed image. These features are selected using particle swarm optimization and classified using support vector machine classifier with different kernel functions. We have validated our experiment using 300 four-chamber echocardiography images (150: normal, 150: CHF) obtained from 50 normal and 50 CHF patients. Our proposed approach yielded maximum average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.33%, 98.66% and 100%, respectively, using ten features. Thus, the developed diagnosis system can effectively detect CHF in its early stage using ultrasound images and aid the clinicians in their diagnosis. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Congestive heart failure; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Machine learning; Texture features; VMD,Automation; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Heart; Image processing; Learning systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Ultrasonic applications; Congestive heart failures; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Echocardiographic images; Echocardiography Images; Mode decomposition techniques; Sensitivity and specificity; Support vector machine classifiers; Texture features; Image texture,"Raghavendra, U.; Department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal UniversityIndia; email: raghavendra.u@manipal.edu",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

Flat or dab fingerprints and rolled fingerprints are being acquired from people by many biometric agencies across the world from their respective governments. But at times un-identification of legitimate users and fault recognition of fraudulent persons are the major issues in biometric identification and verification. Though fingerprint acquisition systems are working accurately, the issue arises during verification or authentication of a person if there is a distortion in the fingerprint (whether flat or rolled). Distortion may be due to intentional torque applied by the deceitful person or the acquisition procedure. To curb this issue, we are proposing novel approach, which is totally a combination of off-line, and online registration methods which includes old method of rolled fingerprints registration (card-ink based), a two phase approach. In the first phase clear rolled fingerprints are taken from the people through fingerprint acquisition to store them in database as minutiae files. In the second phase card-ink based rolled fingerprints which are likely distorted are taken through web-camera and processed by different image processing filters for distortion rectification. Then minutiae file of the rectified rolled fingerprint is going to be compared with the existing minutiae files in the database.

These applications have been essentially demanding the requirement of low computational complexity of FrFT. In this paper, FrFT is simplified to reduce the complexity, and further an efficient CORDIC-based architecture for computing discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) is proposed which brings down the computational complexity and hardware requirements and provides the flexibility to change the user defined fractional angles to compute DFrFT on-the-fly. Architectural design and working method of proposed architecture along with its constituent blocks are discussed. The hardware complexity and throughput of the proposed architecture are illustrated as well. Finally, the architecture of DFrFT of the order sixteen is implemented using Verilog HDL and synthesized targeting an FPGA device ”XLV5LX110T”. The hardware simulation is performed for functional verification, which is compared with the MATLAB simulation results.

As a result, security of digital information has become a big problem. Reversible watermarking and cryptography has been regarded as an adequate solution to protect the digital data from illegal access. In this paper, a novel combination of reversible watermarking and image encryption technique based on the discrete cosine transform and scrambling technique is presented. Firstly, the plain image is encrypted by scrambling technique. Then, a lossless digital watermark is embedded in the encrypted image by a discrete cosine transform. Thus an encrypted image with watermark embedded in it is obtained. Finally, the original image can be recovered by the reverse process. Experimental results show that the proposed technique possesses high security and is able to withstand a variety of signal processing attacks. © 2017 IEEE.",,Cryptography; Digital watermarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Image enhancement; Image watermarking; Signal processing; Digital information; Encrypted images; Image encryptions; Multimedia contents; Original images; Reverse process; Reversible watermarking; Scrambling techniques; Image processing,"Pushpad, A.; National Institute of Technical Teacher's Training and ResearchIndia; email: pushpadakshay@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To minimize road accidents through vision enhancement in turbid weather, an efficient visibility enhancement using fog removal technique plays a very significant role as fog greatly reduces the contrast and hence affects the Driver Assistance System (DAS) too. In this paper, an effective post-processing technique is proposed for visibility enhancement through fog removal using a single gray or a color image. The proposed algorithm is based on Dark Channel Prior (DCP) concept followed by a post-processing technique based visibility enhancement scheme for foggy images.

Partitioned image scanning method divides the input image into two or more sub-images and then applies the desired filter function on each sub-image in parallel. Adjacent row scanning method provides the input to each filter alternatively, one accessing odd rows and the other even rows of the input image. From the results, it is evident that the resources utilized by partitioned image scanning method are more than that of adjacent row scanning method.

Image processing based counterfeit IC design techniques are promising, but currently often suffer from high computational complexity and requirement of expensive image acquisition infrastructure. We describe two techniques based on image texture analysis to automate the process of counterfeit IC detection. The first method employs local textural feature identification to detect counterfeit ICs. The second method includes identification of counterfeit ICs by segmenting the image into regions of different textural features using texture filters. The first method is of lower computational complexity compared to the segmentation method, but the second method is capable of blind identification in the sense that it does not require knowledge of the textural features of a golden IC sample.

In this papera secure hybrid digital image watermarking scheme based on Redundant Discrete wavelet transform (RDWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Singular value decomposition (SVD) in zigzag order with Arnold transform is presented. Watermark image is scrambled by Arnold transform to boost up its secrecy and robustness. In presented scheme, a gray scale cover image is rearranged through zigzag sequence and then RDWT is implemented on this reordered cover image. After that DCT, SVD is implemented on mid and high frequency sub-bands (LH, LH, and HH) of cover image and modified the singular values of these sub-bands by embedding the scrambled gray scale watermark image. This presented scheme is more imperceptible and an enormous capacity due to the properties of RDWT and SVD. The benefit of the presented schemeis more robust and secured against various image processing attacks.

With the increasing number of image databases consisting of a large number of images, it is challenging to extract images specific to our requirement. Therefore, it becomes necessary to design efficient search systems to query large image databases. Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) algorithms analyze the contents of an image rather than the metadata associated with it. This allows image queries to be processed in a way that extracts images from the database, having a close similarity with the query image. Conventional CBIR systems using cosine similarity have a problem of associating images having maximum content overlap, thus similar orientation and size. Therefore, images relevant to the query but having different sizes and orientation are given lower priority in their results. In this article, we propose an approach which solves this problem and attempts to return the results relevant to the query, irrespective of the contents' orientation and size, using appropriate feature extraction techniques. 32 different types of leaves form a preliminary database of 1427 images. The system performance is assessed from the query results of 16 new images belonging to each of the 32 leaf classes. Features such as leaf shape, structure, color, and texture are extracted for pattern matching. Neural network using radial basis function is used for leaf classification to aid query result retrieval. The base accuracy of the CBIR system is 96.88%. Using a simple human relevance feedback mechanism, the neural network trains itself to capture trends in existing leaf classes. As a result, the accuracy of the CBIR system increases as the database is queried. Features extracted from correctly classified leaves are added to the training set. Thus, patterns in leaves belonging to similar and dissimilar classes are captured by the neural network. This increases the robustness of the CBIR to establish maximum possible precision and recall rates along with accurate retrieval of orientation and size varying results. © 2017 IEEE.",content-based image retrieval; eigen transformation; morphological processing; neural networks; radial basis function; rotational invariance; structural decomposition,Color matching; Content based retrieval; Functions; Image processing; Image retrieval; Imaging techniques; Neural networks; Pattern matching; Query languages; Query processing; Radial basis function networks; Signal processing; Content based image retrieval; eigen transformation; Morphological processing; Radial basis functions; Rotational invariances; Structural decomposition; Search engines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Dictionary learning algorithms have made it possible to engineer data adaptive dictionaries which have promising applications in image compression and image enhancement. The most common sparse dictionary learning algorithms use the techniques of matching pursuit and K-SVD iteratively for sparse coding and dictionary learning respectively. While this technique produces good results, it requires a large number of iterations to converge to an optimal solution. In this article, we propose a closed form convex optimization technique for both sparse coding and dictionary learning. The approach results in providing the best possible dictionary and the sparsest representation resulting in minimum reconstruction error which in turn results in compression. It is clearly seen from the results that the proposed algorithm provides much better reconstruction results than conventional sparse dictionary techniques for a fixed number of iterations. Depending upon the amount of details present in the image, the proposed algorithm is seen to reach the optimal solution with significantly lower number of iterations. Consequently low mean squared error is obtained using the proposed algorithm. We demonstrate the results with standard image. © 2017 IEEE.",convex optimization; dictionary learning; image compression; normal equation; sparse coding,Codes (symbols); Convex optimization; Image coding; Image enhancement; Image processing; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Optimal systems; Optimization; Signal processing; Convex optimization techniques; Dictionary learning; Dictionary learning algorithms; Normal equations; Over-complete dictionaries; Reconstruction error; Sparse coding; Sparse representation; Image compression,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The matrix comprises of emerging technologies, research areas and the application domains as the parameters. It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data & analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external recognition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference. © 2016 IEEE.",Arduino; Cloud services and minor project; IoT; Raspberry Pi; Sensors; Smart city; Web technology,Big data; Cloud computing; Education; Educational technology; Engineering research; Image processing; Internet of things; Matrix algebra; Open source software; Open systems; Sensors; Smart city; Software engineering; Students; Arduino; Cloud services; Computer science and engineerings; Continuous internal evaluations; Cumulative grade point averages; Problem identification; Requirement specification; Web technologies; Engineering education,,Ramachandran M.Garg D.Kumar V.A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

DR is widely applied for better data visualization and improving learning in all the above fields. In this manuscript, we propose a novel DR approach namely, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) by developing Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS). Traditional pattern selection methods discriminate boundary and non-boundary patterns with the help of class information and nearest neighbors. And these methods completely ignore noisy patterns which may degrade the performance of subsequent subspace learning. To overcome this, we develop Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS), in which data instances are partitioned into boundary, non-boundary and noisy patterns. With the help of noisy-free boundary and non-boundary patterns, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) has been proposed by developing new within and between-class scatters. These scatters model discriminations between lengths (L2-norms) of different class instances by considering only boundary and non-boundary patterns, while ignoring noisy patterns. A cosine hyperbolic frame work has been developed to formulate the objective of NLDA. Moreover, NLDA can also model the discrimination of multimodal data as different class data may consist of different lengths. Experimental study conducted on the synthesized data, UCI, and leeds butterfly databases. Moreover, an experimental study over human and computer interaction, i.e., face recognition (one of the application areas of expert and intelligent systems), has been performed. And, these studies prove that the proposed method can produce better discriminated subspace compare to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cosine hyperbolic; Dimensionality reduction; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Relevant patterns; Subspace learning,Data mining; Data visualization; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Human computer interaction; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Between class scatter; Cosine hyperbolic; Dimensionality reduction; Model discrimination; NAtural language processing; Relevant patterns; State-of-the-art methods; Subspace learning; Pattern recognition,"Murthy, K.R.email: k.ramachandra@isical.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016401105

Due to the lack of trained sonographers in remote areas, the ultrasound videos scanned by these untrained persons do not contain the proper information that is required by a physician. As compared to standard methods for video transmission, mHealth driven systems need to be developed for transmitting valid medical videos. To overcome this problem, we are proposing an organ validation algorithm to evaluate the ultrasound video based on the content present. This will guide the semi skilled person to acquire the representative data from patient. Advancement in smartphone technology allows us to perform high medical image processing on smartphone. In this paper we have developed an Application (APP) for a smartphone which can automatically detect the valid frames (which consist of clear organ visibility) in an ultrasound video and ignores the invalid frames (which consist of no-organ visibility), and produces a compressed sized video. This is done by extracting the GIST features from the Region of Interest (ROI) of the frame and then classifying the frame using SVM classifier with quadratic kernel. The developed application resulted with the accuracy of 94.93% in classifying valid and invalid images. © 2017 IEEE.",,"algorithm; echography; human; image processing; smartphone; validation study; videorecording; Algorithms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Smartphone; Ultrasonography; Video Recording",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1557170X,9.78151E+12,,29060845,English,Proc.

Imaging of these dental anomalies is done with radiographic examination. Panoramic radiography/ Orthopantomography (OPG) is a common modality to screen patients with an advantage of ease of imaging and reduced exposure to patients. The panoramic images obtained with this equipment are exploited by noise embedded during its acquisition making the detection of this dental caries difficult. Detection and characterization of dental caries and various other maxilla-facial pathologies can be achieved by the application of computer aided image processing algorithms applied on dental panoramic images. This paper presents two distinct image processing algorithms for detection of dental anomalies. The first part of this paper presents a novel approach for detection of dental caries using hybridized negative transformation. The second part of paper presents, statistical texture analysis for the dental images containing cysts along with dental caries. The texture analysis is used when the objects to be segmented based on texture content rather than intensities. The texture of panoramic image is characterized by Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The texture features obtained from the GLCM are energy, entropy, homogeneity, contrast and correlation. These texture features can be used to find texture boundaries to obtain segmentation about the region of cysts. Results obtained by both the methods were satisfactory correlating with the diagnosis made by the maxillofacial radiologists. © 2017 IEEE.",,"dental caries; human; image enhancement; image processing; panoramic radiography; X ray; Dental Caries; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiography, Panoramic; X-Rays",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1557170X,9.78151E+12,,29059942,English,Proc.

But blind and accurate estimation of noise in an unknown image is a challenging task and hence is an open area of research. We propose the first elegant and novel blind noise estimation method based on random image tile selection and statistical sampling theory for estimating standard deviation of zero mean Gaussian and speckle noise in digital images. Randomly selected samples, i.e., pixels with (Formula presented.) neighborhood, are checked for availability of edges in the tile. If there is an edge in the tile at more than one neighboring pixel, the tile is excluded. Only non-edge tiles are used for estimation of noise in the tile and subsequently in the image using the concepts of statistical sampling theory. Finally, we propose a supervised curve fitting approach using the proposed noise estimation model for more accurate estimation of standard deviation of the two types of noise. The proposed technique is computationally efficient as it is a selective random sample-based spatial domain technique. Benchmarking with other contemporary techniques published so far shows that the proposed technique clearly outperforms the others by at least 5% improved noise estimates, over a very wide range of noise. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany",Blind noise estimation; Gaussian noise; Random conditional sampling; Speckle noise; Statistical sampling theory,Curve fitting; Estimation; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Pattern recognition; Pixels; Sampling; Speckle; Statistics; Accurate estimation; Computationally efficient; Conditional sampling; Contemporary techniques; Noise estimation; Processing applications; Speckle noise; Statistical sampling theories; Image sampling,"Kamble, V.M.; Visvesvaraya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: vipinkamble97@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,1782789,,VICOE,,English,Visual Comput,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028982589

An adversary may perform copy-paste forgery where portions from JPEG image files are copy-pasted into another image file (JPEG, TIFF, etc.) and then save it in uncompressed format (TIFF). It is known that tampered JPEG images contain traces of compression artifacts. In this paper, we propose an automated blind JPEG image forgery detection and localization technique with high detection accuracy, which is effective for identifying traces of JPEG compression in digital images saved in uncompressed format (TIFF). The forgery detection and localization is based on the computation and analysis of a correlation matrix calculated by recompressing the given (possibly tampered) image at different quality factors and then comparing the recompressed versions with the given image.

In this form of forgery, region(s) of an image is(are) copied and pasted onto itself, and subsequently the forged image is processed appropriately to hide the effects of forgery. State-of-the-art copy-move forgery detection techniques for digital images are primarily motivated toward finding duplicate regions in an image. The last decade has seen lot of research advancement in the area of digital image forensics, whereby the investigation for possible forgeries is solely based on post-processing of images. In this study, the authors present a three-way classification of state-of-the-art digital forensic techniques, along with a complete survey of their operating principles. In addition, they analyse the schemes and evaluate and compare their performances in terms of a proposed set of parameters, which may be used as a standard benchmark for evaluating the efficiency of any general copy-move forgery detection technique for digital images.

Classical wavelet transforms, like discrete wavelet transform (DWT), are shift sensitive and provide information in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions only. Shift invariance and directional information are required for better reconstruction of images. In this work, we propose a semi-blind gray scale image watermarking technique in redundant wavelet domain. The primary focus of this research is to highlight the usefulness of redundant wavelet transforms in image watermarking. We have used nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT). These redundant transforms are shift invariant. Also, NSCT provides rich directional information. Thus, they overcome the shortcomings of DWT and are more useful in image watermarking. We have integrated singular value decomposition (SVD) in the proposed method. We use NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition for single and dual image watermarking. For single watermark embedding, cover images are sub-sampled followed by one level NSCT and RDWT decomposition. SVD has been applied on obtained RDWT coefficients. In the same way, image watermark has been processed and NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition has been applied on it. SVD coefficients of the cover image and watermark image have been combined using scaling factor. Inverse SVD-RDWT-NSCT operation together with reverse sub-sampling provides watermarked image. For extraction of the watermark, we follow the NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition and SVD coefficients have been separated by the same scaling factor that was used in embedding. In the dual watermarking, Arnold transform has been used for encryption of the text watermark and rest of the steps are similar to single watermarking. NSCT, RDWT and SVD improve the performance of the proposed method against geometrical and image processing attacks for single and dual image watermarking. Experiments have been carried over standard images and results have been shown for natural and medical images. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), correlation coefficient (CC), bit error rate (BER) and structural similarity index metric (SSIM) show that the proposed method is suitable for single and dual image watermarking, and outperforms existing methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Hybrid image watermarking; Image watermarking; Nonsubsampled contourlet transform; Redundant discrete wavelet transform; Singular value decomposition,Bit error rate; Copyrights; Cryptography; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image coding; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image processing; Inverse problems; Medical imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Classical wavelet transforms; Non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT); Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms; Peak signal to noise ratio; Redundant discrete wavelet transform; Redundant wavelet transform; Semi-blind image watermarking; Structural similarity indices; Image watermarking,"Singh, R.; Department of Computer Science, Banasthali UniversityIndia; email: jkrajivsingh@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015723210

The orthogonal rotation invariant moments (ORIMs) have several useful characteristics which make them very suitable for multi-frame image super-resolution application. Among the various ORIMs, Zernike moments (ZMs) and pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs)-based SR approaches, i.e., NLM-ZMs and NLM-PZMs, have already shown improved SR performances for multi-frame image super-resolution. However, it is a well-known fact that among many ORIMs, orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments (OFMMs) demonstrate better noise robustness and image representation capabilities for small images as compared to ZMs and PZMs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-frame image super-resolution approach using OFMMs. The proposed approach is based on the NLM framework because of its inherent capability of estimating motion implicitly. We have referred to this proposed approach as NLM-OFMMs-I. Also, a novel idea of using OFMMs-based interpolation in place of traditional Lanczos interpolation for obtaining an initial estimate of HR sequence has been presented in this paper. This variant of the proposed approach is referred to as NLM-OFMMs-II. Detailed experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed OFMMs-based SR approaches to generate high-quality HR images in the presence of factors like image noise, global motion, local motion, and rotation in between the image frames. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Image reconstruction; Multi-frame image super-resolution; Noise robustness; Nonlocal means; Orthogonal rotation invariant moments,Feature extraction; Image denoising; Image processing; Interpolation; Optical resolving power; Image representations; Image super resolutions; Image super-resolution reconstruction; Noise robustness; Non-local means; Orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments; Orthogonal rotations; Pseudo- Zernike Moments; Image reconstruction,"Singh, C.; Department of Computer Science, Punjabi UniversityIndia; email: chandan.csp@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,1419382,,DISPD,,English,Disp,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025600487

Sometimes, CS measurements need transmission over radio mobile channel for bandwidth preserving and energy efficient system design and/or application specific system design such as wireless body area network (WBAN), remote surveillance system etc. To this aim, this work proposes an integrated system design for quality improvement in CS reconstructed images over radio mobile channel modelled as Rayleigh flat fading. The design of a non-zero-entry Single Symbol Decodable Square Complex Orthogonal, Space Time Block Codes (STBC) for 16 antennas is proposed first. This multi-channel facility is then exploited for transmission of CS measurements, which at the receiver side, undergo Robbins–Monro (RM) method, a non-parametric stochastic approach for predicting the unobserved spaces from the observed ones through recursive filtering. Similar study is also done using a relaxed convex optimization of the basis pursuit algorithm, a parametric based approach. Extensive simulation results highlight the efficacy of the proposed CS and STBC (CS–STBC) scheme for the quality improvement on the reconstructed images as the variation in the number of antennas, change in the number of measurements and variation on signal-to-noise ratio.

Images can be distorted from multiple sources like a fault in sensors, camera shake, poor lighting, over-exposure etc. All these distortions reduce the visual quality of images. Assessing the quality of images can be done with the use of a reference image of the same scene or without it. Without the use of reference image, quality assessment is a very difficult task. Machine learning approaches are very common in no-reference image quality assessment. No reference strategies are very useful if the type of distortion is known. Contrast assessment is a very important application in image processing as poor contrast images are difficult for automated image processing. In this paper, we propose a no-reference image quality measure for images with respect to contrast using random forest regression and validate the results using standard datasets.

This requirement demands the need for noise free data or images. The existing partial differential equation based diffusion models can remove noise present in an image but lacking in preserving thin lines, fine details and sharp corners. The classifier algorithms can able to make correct judgement to which class the image belongs to only if all edges are preserved properly during denoising process. To satisfy this requirement the authors proposed a new improved partial differential equation based diffusion algorithm for edge preserving image denoising. The proposed new anisotropic diffusion algorithm is an extension of self-snake diffusion filter which estimates edge and gradient directions as eigenvectors of a structure tensor matrix. The unique feature of this proposed anisotropic diffusion algorithm is diffusion rate at various parts of an image matches with the speed of level set flow. In the proposed algorithm an efficient edge indicator function dependent on the trace of the structure tensor matrix is used. The proposed model performs best in preserving thin lines, sharp corners and fine details since diffusion happens only along edges and diffusion is totally stopped across edges in this model. The additional edge-stopping term which is a vector dot product of derivative of an edge stopping function and derivative of an image computed along gradient and edge orthogonal directions is used in this model as shock filter which enables increased sharpness at all discontinuities. The performance of proposed diffusion algorithm is compared with other classical diffusion filters like conventional perona-malik diffusion, conventional self-snake diffusion methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Anisotropic diffusion; Determinant of matrix; Edge stopping function; EigenVector; Enhancement; Perona-Malik model; Structure tensor matrix; Trace of matrix,Anisotropy; Classification (of information); Diffusion; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Image denoising; Image enhancement; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Optical anisotropy; Orthogonal functions; Partial differential equations; Predictive analytics; Tensors; Anisotropic Diffusion; Anisotropic diffusion model; Edge stopping functions; Orthogonal directions; Performance of classifier; Perona-Malik diffusions; Perona-malik models; Structure tensors; Edge detection,"Kamalaveni, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita UniversityIndia; email: v_kamalaveni@cb.amrita.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011923284

This method is intended to provide remedies from the shortcomings of the technique proposed by Lin et al. (2008), and invalidates the effect of intentional attacks recently designed by Meerwald et al. (2009). The algorithm incorporates three level image decomposition using lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and low-pass subband is utilized for data hiding purpose. Watermark bits are embedded into the blocks of non-overlapped wavelet coefficients of the cover image by quantizing the two maximum coefficients of the corresponding block. In watermark extraction process, the DSR is applied by performing the tuning operation on coefficient blocks of attacked watermarked image. It is a parameter dependent approach that enhances the performance of watermark extraction, where the parameters of DSR inherently depend on the image properties such as standard deviation or variance. As far as security is concerned, the randomization of wavelet coefficients, blocks, and watermark bits helps the framework to be more secure. The proposed technique is also examined against multiple watermarking attack and successfully proves its authenticity and ownership.

This paper proposes, an image-in-image communication scheme as SIS for progressive quality access control coupled with data hiding. The secret image is partitioned into few noise-like shadows of reduced size. These are then embedded into a group of host images to generate stego images. Since spread spectrum watermarking meets data imperceptibility and retain hidden data even after different deliberate attacks and unintentional operations, an M-ary SS modulation based watermarking scheme is performed to embed the shadows into the respective set of cover images. Progressive quality access for the secret image depends on the number of the authenticated users participated in the decoding process.

In this LCMF approach the gradient angle between the centre of mass and centre pixel of a selected neighborhood is extracted. Theoretically it is shown that this feature is illumination invariant using the Illumination Reflectance Model (IRM) and is robust to different illumination variations. It is also shown that this method does not involve any explicit computation of Luminance (L) component and as centre of mass is an inherent feature of a mass distribution, its slope with the centre pixel of the neighborhood has local edge preserving capabilities. The angle of the slope obtained using Centre of Mass with the centre pixel of the neighborhood is used as a feature vector. This feature vector is directed from the darkest section of the neighborhood to the brightest section of the neighborhood as Centre of Mass is always positioned towards the brighter side of a mass distribution and hence encrypts the edge orientation. Using the L1 norm distance measure, these feature vectors are used to classify the images. The method does not involve any preprocessing and training of images. The proposed method has been successfully tested under different illumination variant databases like AR, CMU-PIE, and extended Yale B using standard protocols, and performance is compared with recently published methods in terms of rank-1 recognition accuracy. The method is also applied on Sketch-Photo pair database like CUHK. For unbiased or fair performance evaluation, the Sensitivity and Specificity are also being measured for the proposed method on all the databases. The proposed method gives better accuracy performance and outperforms other recent face recognition methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Centre of mass; Gradient; Illumination invariant; Luminosity; Mass distribution; Reflectance model,Database systems; Gradient methods; Image processing; Luminance; Pixels; Reflection; Centre of mass; Face recognition methods; Illumination insensitive; Illumination invariant; Illumination variation; Mass distribution; Reflectance model; Sensitivity and specificity; Face recognition,"Sarkar, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of CalcuttaIndia; email: sanchayansarkar@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017173853

The classification of the images is one of the effective ways to manage and retrieve images. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale multimedia image data classification algorithm based on deep learning. We firstly select the image characteristics to represent the flag for retrieval, which represents the color, texture and shape characteristics respectively. A feature of color is the most basic image data, mainly including the average brightness, color histogram and dominant color, etc. What the texture refers to is the image data in the anomalous, macroscopic as well as orderly one key character that on partial has. The contour feature extraction of image data needs to rely on the edge detection, edge of the detected edge through the connection or grouping to form a meaningful image event. Secondly, we revise the convolutional neural network model based on the pooling operation optimization, the pooling is in the process of the convolution operation to extract the image characteristics of the different locations to gather statistics. Furthermore, we integrate the parallel and could storage strategy to enhance the efficiency of the proposed methodology. The performance of the algorithm is verified, compared with the other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed one obtains the better efficiency and accuracy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image data classification; Information retrieval; Large-scale system; Multimedia architecture,Classification (of information); Color; Convolution; Data mining; Digital storage; Edge detection; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Information retrieval; Large scale systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Search engines; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image characteristics; Image data; Multimedia architecture; Operation optimization; Shape characteristics; State-of-the-art approach; Image texture,"Li, J.; Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: lijuncas@163.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009863270

All the necessary information from these two modalities has to be integrated into a single image for better diagnosis and treatment of a patient. Image fusion is a process of combining useful or complementary information from multiple images into a single image. In this article, we present a new weighted average fusion algorithm to fuse MRI and CT images of a brain based on guided image filter and the image statistics. The proposed algorithm is as follows: detail layers are extracted from each source image by using guided image filter. Weights corresponding to each source image are calculated from the detail layers with help of image statistics. Then a weighted average fusion strategy is implemented to integrate source image information into a single image. Fusion performance is assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Proposed method is compared with the traditional and recent image fusion methods.

Watermarking make the image secure towards unlawful use; but at the same time, it causes some information loss too. Medical and defense are few fields, where even a small change in data can be very problematic. So there is need of reliable and lossless watermarking schemes. The present study is focused on the development of lossless watermarking method that can fulfill five basic requirements (robustness, reversibility, invisibility, security and capacity) of ideal lossless watermarking scheme maximally. Arnold transformed watermark is embedded into the host to restrict any unauthorized access of watermark even after extraction. Slantlet transformed coefficients are known to be quite robust towards image processing attacks; so block wise Slantlet transform is employed to resist the maximum attacks and to ensure a decent capacity. Mean values of transformed coefficients are used for embedding to increase the robustness and imperceptibility. The spatial domain overflow/underflow (due to embedding) is taken care by a post processing to satisfy the reversibility requirements. The embedding strength of watermarking is controlled with the help of artificial bee colony (ABC) in order to get an optimal tradeoff between invisibility and robustness. The proposed scheme is applied to a range of images to show its applicability to different domains. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Artificial bee colony; Medical image watermarking; Reversible watermarking; Robustness; Slantlet Transform (SLT),Digital watermarking; Image processing; Medical imaging; Optimization; Robustness (control systems); Watermarking; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Lossless watermarking; Ownership verification; Reversible image watermarking; Reversible watermarking; Slantlet transform; Unauthorized access; Image watermarking,"Ahn, C.W.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066 Seobu-ro, South Korea; email: cwan@skku.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974777341

Current discrete wavelet transform (DWT) steganography adds an unacceptable distortion to the images and is considered as an ineffective in terms of security. Applying the DE scheme to the current DWT steganographic methods solves the problems of these methods, and reduces the distortion added to the images, and thus improves the embedding efficiency. The proposed algorithm first converts the secret image into a sequence of base-5 digits. After that, the cover image is transformed into the DWT domain and segmented into 2 × 1 coefficient pairs. The DE scheme is used then to change at most one coefficient of each coefficient pair to embed the base-5 digits. Experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in embedding compared to other methods in terms of embedding payload and image quality. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is attacked by well-known steganalysis software. Results are showing that the proposed algorithm is secure against the powerful universal steganalyzer “ensemble classifier” and the histogram attack. The results also reveal that the proposed algorithm is robust against different image processing attacks such as compression, added noise, and cropping attacks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Diamond encoding (DE); Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Embedding payload; Image steganography; Imperceptibility,Diamonds; Discrete wavelet transforms; Encoding (symbols); Image coding; Image processing; Steganography; Wavelet transforms; Diamond encoding; Embedding algorithms; Embedding efficiency; Embedding payload; Ensemble classifiers; Image steganography; Imperceptibility; Steganographic algorithms; Digital image storage,"Atawneh, S.; College of Computing and Informatics, Saudi Electronic UniversitySaudi Arabia; email: satawneh@seu.edu.sa",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988450786

To enhance the quality of the software, number of techniques should be adopted. In the present scenario lots of quantifiable methods/tools are used to measure the various aspects of the software but with the rapid pace of the technology/paradigms. It requires much more effort and research work with the new paradigms. Software metrics measure different attributes of software like size, complexity, reliability, thereby providing useful information about the external quality aspects of software like reusability, maintainability and testability. This paper discusses the evolution of software metrics from traditional function-oriented to objectoriented to component-based to aspect-oriented paradigm along with advantages and limitations of software metrics. As traditional function-oriented metrics lack in quality parameters like reusability, maintainability and so, object-oriented metrics have become one of the popular concepts in today's software development environment. Object-oriented metrics have been widely accepted because of many attributes like reusability, better abstraction, polymorphism, simplicity, time-saving, costeffectiveness and easy maintenance in the software code. Similarly, component-based and aspect-oriented metrics take this journey forward to achieve these quality aspects in the software more effectively. This paper also describes how these new paradigms help to improve the software quality, system performance and productivity in software development. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Abstraction; Aspect-oriented metrics; Component-based metrics; Function-oriented metrics; Objectoriented metrics; Polymorphism; Reliability; Reusability; Software metrics,Abstracting; Computer software reusability; Computer software selection and evaluation; Cost engineering; Engineering research; Image processing; Maintainability; Polymorphism; Reliability; Reusability; Software design; Software engineering; Software reliability; Abstraction; Aspect-oriented; Component based; Object oriented metrics; Software metrics; Object oriented programming,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Rotation visual cryptography is advanced technique of VCS where direct stacking of shares will not uphold the original image. In the existing literature, encryption techniques of VCS take longer time that can be substantially reduced by using CUDA. The proposed method uses CUDA for computationally intensive independent tasks performed on pixels during the rotation VCS. Parallel implementation of VCS will be faster and can be adopted in many real time applications that requires image security.

Of these, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults. Tumor biopsy being challenging for brain tumor patients, noninvasive techniques like imaging play an important role in the process of brain cancer detection, diagnosis and prognosis; particularly using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Therefore, development of advanced extraction and selection strategies of quantitative MRI features become necessary for noninvasively predicting and grading the tumors. In this paper we extract 56 three-dimensional quantitative MRI features, related to tumor image intensities, shape and texture, from 254 brain tumor patients. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier based on linguistic hedges (ANFC-LH) is developed to simultaneously select significant features and predict the tumor grade. ANFC-LH achieves a significantly higher testing accuracy (85.83%) as compared to existing standard classifiers. © 2017 IEEE.",,Brain; Classification (of information); Diseases; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Grading; Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Tumors; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy; Diagnosis and prognosis; Glioblastoma multiforme; Linguistic hedges; Noninvasive technique; Primary brain tumors; Quantitative mris; Shape and textures; Diagnosis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10987584,9.78151E+12,PIFSF,,English,IEEE Int Conf Fuzzy Syst,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030154921

In scientific experiments so far, only detection and measurement of biophotons has been possible. Experiments have shown the emission of ultraweak biophotons in a spectrum of several colors. The challenges faced in capturing the image of ultraweak photons are today the topic of research for the development of a biophotonic camera. A literature survey on thought form images found a large number of true color images in Theosophical texts published a hundred years ago. Each image was attributed comments of 'Very Good, Good, Bad, or Very Bad, or mix of all' based on the three aspects of Color, Form (Shape), and Outline of the images but without any scientific proof. It was found that there is great deal of similarity of views of Theosophists and Biophysicists on the structural form of human beings. This provided the motivation to analyze the thought form images on the aspect of color using HSV (Hue Saturation Value) space in two recently reported papers. In this paper, the second aspect of shape, has been investigated using Radon Transform and Histograms on a sample of thirty one thought-form images out of several from Theosophical literature. Results show that all images, except one, were classified correctly in the four patterns when compared with the comments in the text. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Biofields; Biophotons; Histograms; HSV; Radon Transform; Theosophy; Thought-Forms,Behavioral research; Color; Graphic methods; Mathematical transformations; Pattern recognition; Radon; Biofields; Biophotons; Histograms; Radon Transform; Theosophy; Image processing,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Privacy protection of additional data as well as cover media makes it attractive for applications in medical imaging, cloud storage, forensics etc. In this paper, a new method for reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI), is proposed. Our method adopts the approach of reserving sufficient space for the additional data before encrypting the cover image. First we identify suitable blocks for hiding data from various parts of the image. Before encrypting the image, one or more LSB-planes of these blocks are backed-up into remaining parts of the image using a high-performing traditional RDH method that works on unencrypted images. After encrypting the image, those LSB-planes are used to hide additional data. Recovery of original cover image and error-free extraction of additional data is guaranteed always. Moreover, the proposed method is simple and intuitive. Experimentally results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for reversible data hiding in encrypted images. © 2017 IEEE.",encryption; histogram; interpolation; reservation; Reversible data hiding,Cryptography; Digital storage; Interpolation; Medical imaging; Steganography; Additional datum; Encrypted images; histogram; Privacy protection; Research communities; reservation; Reversible data hiding; State-of-the-art methods; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can indicate structural changes in the cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes micro-photographed under metaphase is done by characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread images. Currently, considerable effort and time is spent to manually segment out chromosomes from cell images, and classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24 types, or for diseased cells to one of the known translocated types. Segmenting out the chromosomes in such images can be especially laborious and is often done manually, if there are overlapping chromosomes in the image which are not easily separable by image processing techniques. Many techniques have been proposed to automate the segmentation and classification of chromosomes from spread images with reasonable accuracy, but given the criticality of the domain, a human in the loop is often still required. In this paper, we present a method to segment out and classify chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of crowdsourcing, preprocessing and deep learning, wherein the non-expert crowd from CrowdFlower is utilized to segment out the chromosomes from the cell image, which are then straightened and fed into a (hierarchical) deep neural network for classification. Experiments are performed on 400 real healthy patient images obtained from a hospital. Results are encouraging and promise to significantly reduce the cognitive burden of segmenting and karyotyping chromosomes. © 2017 IEEE.",,Cells; Chromosomes; Computer vision; Crowdsourcing; Cytology; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Chromosome segmentation; Deep classifications; Human-in-the-loop; Image processing technique; Metaphase chromosomes; Overlapping chromosomes; Patient images; Reasonable accuracy; Image segmentation,,,IEEE Computer Society,21607508,9.78154E+12,,,English,IEEE Comput.

Chaotic signals are pseudo random signals with no periodicity over infinite length. However, the series can be generated with the precise knowledge of the few parameters like system parameters and initial conditions of the chaotic system. With the given nature of pseudo-randomness and extreme sensitivity to parameters, chaotic sequences are ideal for encryption. In literature, these chaotic sequences are generally generated using continuous time chaotic systems. Since image data to be transmitted is in digital form and encryption algorithms are also executed on digital devices, so it is proposed to use discrete time chaotic communication scheme. Further, its effectiveness for encryption of digital images is also analyzed. To further enhance the security encrypted data is embedded in the dynamics of discrete time chaotic transmitter system. To recover the message at the receiver, design of discrete time UIO along with a procedure to recover unknown message signal using estimated states is given. Existence conditions for the UIO are analytically derived in terms of LMIs. Solution of these LMIs gives the observer design matrices. Robustness of UIO based chaotic communication scheme against attacks is analyzed by studying return maps of the transmitted signal. It is reported that security of chaotic communication scheme can be compromised by studying the return maps of the transmitted signal. To validate the proposed approach results of simulation and security analysis are presented. © 2017 IEEE.",,Chaotic systems; Continuous time systems; Digital devices; Image processing; Signal receivers; Chaotic communications; Chaotic transmitters; Encryption algorithms; Existence conditions; Pseudorandom signals; Secure communication scheme; Sensitivity to parameters; Unknown input observer; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, an integrated image compression and encryption technique using run length encoding scheme and henon chaotic map is presented. Run length encoding scheme is common scheme and a natural choice for image compression. Run length encoding generates (value, count) pairs such that the value is repeated 'count' number of times. In this paper, we used the run length encoding technique for lossy image compression. We designed a lossy run length encoder that exploits the pixel redundancy and visual imperceptibility of human eye to fine details in the digital images. Along with compression we perform image encryption using henon chaotic map. After encryption the size and resolution of the image is changed that further enhances the security.

Although there has been substantial work in this context, automation has been limited to only transporting a few objects at a time, particularly while ensuring collision avoidances with other freely diffusing objects in the workspace. In this paper, we provide the first step in addressing this limitation by developing a new algorithm that combines a model predictive controller with a fast grid search-based path planning method.

The cross-modal scenario deals with matching across different modalities and needs to take care of the large variations present across and within each modality. The privileged information scenario deals with the situation that all the information available during training may not be available during the testing stage, and hence, algorithms need to leverage the extra information from the training stage itself. We show that for multi-modal data, either one of the above situations may arise if one modality is absent during testing. Here, we propose a novel framework, which can handle both these scenarios seamlessly with applications to matching multi-modal data. The proposed approach jointly uses data from the two modalities to build a canonical representation, which encompasses information from both the modalities. We explore four different types of canonical representations for different types of data. The algorithm computes dictionaries and canonical representation for data from both the modalities, such that the transformed sparse coefficients of both the modalities are equal to that of the canonical representation. The sparse coefficients are finally matched using Mahalanobis metric. Extensive experiments on different data sets, involving RGBD, text-image, and audio-image data, show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2017 IEEE.",audio-image data; Cross-modal matching; privileged information; RGBD data; text-image data,Image processing; Mathematical models; Audio images; Cross-modal; privileged information; RGBD data; Text images; Modal analysis,"Biswas, S.; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: soma.biswas@ee.iisc.ernet.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10577149,,IIPRE,,English,IEEE Trans Image Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028409616

The ORIMs have several useful characteristics in addition to having the property of image reconstruction. Therefore, they have been used successfully in many image processing applications. Among the various ORIMs, Zernike moments (ZMs), pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs) and orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments (OFMMs) have been considered in our proposed framework. The SR performance of the proposed approach has been compared with the classical interpolation-based approaches like bicubic, cubic B-spline, and Lanczos, as well as with nonlocal-means (NLM), and recently developed NLM+ZMs and NLM+PZMs-based SR approaches on twelve standard test images. The experiments have been conducted on both noise-free and noisy LR images corrupted with uniform blur and Gaussian noise. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ORIMs-based approach in super-resolving both noise-free and noisy images over recently developed NLM+ORIMs-based SR approaches. Also, a comparative performance analysis, among various ORIMs (ZMs, PZMs, and OFMMs), is also presented to determine the ORIM which performs better over others under a given condition.

Matched wavelet can be easily designed if full image is available. Also compared with the standard wavelets as sparsifying bases, matched wavelet may provide better reconstruction results in compressive sensing (CS) application. Since in CS application, we have compressively sensed images instead of full images, existing methods of designing matched wavelets cannot be used. Thus, we propose a joint framework that estimates matched wavelets from compressively sensed images and also reconstructs full images. This paper has three significant contributions. First, a lifting-based, image-matched separable wavelet is designed from compressively sensed images and is also used to reconstruct the same. Second, a simple sensing matrix is employed to sample data at sub-Nyquist rate such that sensing and reconstruction time is reduced considerably. Third, a new multi-level L-Pyramid wavelet decomposition strategy is provided for separable wavelet implementation on images that leads to improved reconstruction performance.

In the present work, an error analysis is performed in determining the centroids of circular objects using synthetic images with eight different signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 2.7 to 17.8. In the first stage, four different centroiding algorithms, namely, Center of Mass, Weighted Center of Mass, Späth algorithm, and Hough transform, are studied and compared. The error analysis shows that Späth algorithm performs better than other algorithms. In the second stage, various image preprocessing techniques, consisting of two filters, namely, Median and Wiener, and five image segmentation methods, namely, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) edge detector, basic global thresholding, and Otsu’s global thresholding, are compared to determine the centroids of circular objects using Späth algorithm. It is found that Wiener filter plus LoG edge detector performs better than other preprocessing techniques. Real images of a calibration target (typical in flow diagnostics) and the secondary atomization of water droplets are then considered for centroids detection. These two images are preprocessed using Wiener filter plus LoG edge detector and then processed using Späth algorithm to detect the centroids of circular objects. It is observed that the results of real image of the calibration target and synthetic images are comparable. Also, based on visual inspection, the centroids detected in the real image of water droplets are found to be reasonably accurate. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Centroiding algorithms; Filtering; Image processing; Segmentation,Bioinformatics; Biomedical engineering; Calibration; Drops; Error analysis; Errors; Filtration; Flow control; Flow visualization; Hough transforms; Image analysis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Median filters; Object detection; Object recognition; Signal to noise ratio; Calibration targets; Centroiding; Global thresholding; Image preprocessing; Laplacian of Gaussian; Preprocessing techniques; Secondary atomization; Segmentation methods; Edge detection,"Adatrao, S.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: s.adatrao1@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,14329360,,,,English,Comput.

The major problem is that they are inherently affected by poor contrast and noise due to the attenuation of light, backscatter in the underwater environment and the quality of sensing elements in camera during acquisition. Image denoising as a preprocessing step is needed for extracting features and accurate object recognition. Adaptive filters are preferred because traditional techniques often result in excess smoothing and fail to preserve edges while removing noise. A fuzzy-based image denoising algorithm is proposed to retain edge information and as well remove noise for restoration of underwater images. The adaptive nature of the proposed algorithm was tested using varying degrees of Gaussian noise. Performance metrics like peak signal noise ratio, normalized mean square error and mean structural similarity index were used for evaluation. Experimental results show the proposed method can remove varying levels of Gaussian noise better than the traditional filters while still preserving 27% edges. © 2017, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Adaptive denoising; Fuzzy logic; Gaussian noise; Impulse noise; Underwater image processing,Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Edge detection; Fuzzy logic; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Impulse noise; Mean square error; Object recognition; Underwater imaging; Adaptive denoising; Image denoising algorithm; Mean structural similarity indices; Normalized mean square error; Peak signal noise ratio; Performance metrics; Traditional techniques; Underwater environments; Image denoising,"Srividhya, K.; Hindustan UniversityIndia; email: sribhuvan@gmail.com",,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,15622479,,,,English,Int.

An encryption for image is said to be effective if it has large key space, aperiodic nature and sensitive to the initial conditions. In addition, it is also desired that the mechanism must have a good combination of computational speed, security and time complexity. These features can be induced in the encryption schemes by incorporation of chaos during encryption/decryption process. In this paper, a novel image encryption scheme based on chaotic maps and Vigenère Scheme is proposed. This scheme has one round consisting of two steps: diffusion and confusion. The former step involves three stages: forward diffusion, matching process using Vigenère scheme and backward diffusion. In later part, position permutation using chaotic map is used to swap pixel positions. The proposed as well as other mechanisms in literature are implemented in Matlab-2015 and their efficacy are compared using several performance metrics.

Global segmentation of mass in mammograms is a complex process due to low contrast mammogram images, irregular shape of mass, speculated margins, and the presence of intensity variations of pixels. This work presents a new approach for mass detection in mammograms, which is based on the variational level set function. Mesh-free based radial basis function (RBF) collocation approach is employed for the evolution of level set function for segmentation of breast as well as suspicious mass region. The mesh-based finite difference method (FDM) is used in literature for evolution of level set function. This work also showcases a comparative study of mesh-free and mesh-based approaches. An anisotropic diffusion filter is employed for enhancement of mammograms. The performance of mass segmentation is analyzed by computing statistical measures. Binarized statistical image features (BSIF) and variants of local binary pattern (LBP) are computed from the segmented suspicious mass regions. These features are given as input to the supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify suspicious mass region as mass (abnormal) or non-mass (normal) region. Validation of the proposed algorithm is done on sample mammograms taken from publicly available Mini-mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) datasets.

These compressed measurements are reconstructed at the receiver using suitable reconstruction algorithms, generally the greedy algorithms. Greedy algorithms are time consuming and complex processes, giving rise to a trade-off between reconstruction performance and algorithmic performance. This work proposes a non-iterative method, non-iterative pseudo inverse based recovery algorithm (NIPIRA), for reconstruction of compressively sensed images and videos that exhibits small complexity and time requirement along with preservation of reconstruction quality. Mathematical proofs for NIPIRA’s accuracy and optimality provide additional theoretical support to the algorithm. NIPIRA gives a minimum PSNR of 32 dB for very few measurements, accuracy of above 97 and 92% decrease in elapsed time compared with other iterative algorithms.

Several regularization based SRR (RSRR) methods have been suggested in the literature to obtain a unique and stable solution. In this paper, we propose a new RSRR framework by imposing two regularization constraints such as structural regularization term (SRT) and high frequency energy term (HFET). SRT utilizes the local phase coherence of the image to maintain consistency of structural features in the reconstruction process. HFET enables to preserve the complete set of high frequency components using phase congruency based on 2D Hilbert transform. Gradient descent method optimizes the regularized cost function. The optimization process starts with an improved initial high resolution (HR) image obtained by Penalized-spline interpolation. The iterative process progresses with an adaptive learning rate to yield a high quality HR solution at a faster rate of convergence.

Further, this paper is a review of local binarization methods having more or less modifications to the original Niblack’s method, depending on the requirements of their model and the processed output. The modifications to NBM can be seen in various applications, such as deteriorated documents image binarization, manuscripts restoration, finding texts in video frames, revealing engraved wooden stamps, vehicle license plate number recognition, stained cytology nuclei detection and product barcodes reading.

However, little work has been done to understand such events through pictures posted on these networks. Given the potential of visual content for influencing users’ thoughts and emotions, we perform a large-scale analysis to study and compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015. We propose a generalizable and highly automated 3-tier pipeline which utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract high-level human understandable image descriptors. We used these descriptors to associate themes and sentiment with images, and analyzed over 57,000 images related to the Paris Attacks. We discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text. We also uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user-generated textual content. Further, our analysis revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment. These findings suggest that large-scale mining of images posted on OSNs during crisis, and other news-making events can significantly augment textual content to understand such events. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Image analysis; Image processing; Computer vision techniques; Image descriptors; Large-scale analysis; Large-scale mining; Negative sentiments; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Public sentiments; Social networking (online),,Diesner J.Ferrari E.Xu G.,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Though the problem appears to be ill-posed, we demonstrate that prior knowledge about how 3D shapes of vehicles project to an image can be used to reason about the reverse process, i.e., how shapes (back-)project from 2D to 3D. We encode this knowledge in shape priors, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then formulate a shape-aware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle keypoints in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving benchmarks, and present superior results to existing monocular, as well as stereo approaches. © 2017 IEEE.",,Convolution; Image processing; Neural networks; Optimization; Robotics; Vehicles; Autonomous driving; Convolutional neural network; Estimation errors; Re-weighted least squares; Reverse process; Robust optimization; Scene understanding; Shape representation; Stereo image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10504729,9.78151E+12,PIIAE,,English,Proc IEEE Int Conf Rob Autom,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027965332

The aim of this study is to propose a solution which can be used to identify TB's presence and start treating such suspected patients. In this paper, we propose a method to use city block measure for segmenting x-ray image which helps in diagnosis of TB. Initially image processing concepts like canny edge detection techniques are applied to x-ray image for preprocessing it. Later K-means clustering algorithm is applied on preprocessed x-ray image to get segmented x-ray image. The outputs of TB x-ray and normal x-ray image are compared and analyzed with sqEuclidean and city block distance measure. Finally the City block distance measure results are found to be more appropriate for segmenting TB x-ray and normal x-ray image. Segmented x-ray image helps doctors in identifying tuberculosis presence, so that early treatment planning can be made on suspected patients without waiting for the exact medical test reports. The advantage of this approach is the ability to interpret x-ray image to know whether it is a TB affected x-ray or normal x-ray. © 2016 IEEE.",Clustering; Image mining; Segmentation; Tuberculosis,Clustering algorithms; Diagnosis; Edge detection; Image processing; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; X ray analysis; Canny edge detection; City-block distances; Clustering; Image mining; Infectious disease; K-Means clustering algorithm; Treatment planning; Tuberculosis; Image segmentation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Different types of color space are RGB, HSV, and CIE XYZ etc. The RGB color space is not trust worthy or very accurate for computer vision applications. It is unsuitable for an application like human hand tracking and gesturing.

Event-driven imaging, based on address-event-representation (AER) proposed earlier, ensures event-driven motion detection and conditional image acquisition. However it relies on delta modulation of pixel data upon event detection, which may lead to error accumulation for grey-scale reconstruction. In this work we propose event-driven on-sensor halftoning scheme based on cellular neural network (CNN), which can achieve compressed image acquisition, reducing the data to one bit per active pixel, while avoiding error accumulation over multiple frames. The proposed scheme can achieve reduction in power dissipation related to image quantization, communication and storage. Event-driven current-mode discrete-time CNN (DT-CNN) circuit is proposed for integration on CMOS imager pixel, which is optimally duty cycled to achieve ultra-low power for the halftoning operation. The impact of design parameters and process variations on the final image quality is assessed through inverse halftoning. Clubbed with event-driven acquisition, the proposed on-sensor halftoning can achieve large reduction in power dissipation and data volume, reduction in total volume, as compared to frame based imaging, as well as event driven grey-scale imaging. © 2017 IEEE.",analog; circuits; image processing; low power; neural networks,Cellular neural networks; Chemical detection; Data reduction; Digital storage; Electric losses; Image acquisition; Image quality; Low power electronics; Networks (circuits); Neural networks; Pixels; VLSI circuits; Address-event representation; analog; Design parameters; Error accumulation; Grey scale imaging; Image quantization; Inverse halftoning; Low Power; Image processing,,Reis R.Stan M.Huebner M.Voros N.,IEEE Computer Society,21593469,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

CA have been applied to a number of image processing tasks such as Convex Hull Detection, Image Denoising etc. but mostly under the limitation of restricting the input to binary images. In general, a gray-scale image may be converted to a number of different binary images which are finally recombined after CA operations on each of them individually. We have developed a multinomial regression based weighed summation method to recombine binary images for better performance of CA based Image Processing algorithms. The recombination algorithm is tested for the specific case of denoising Salt and Pepper Noise to test against standard benchmark algorithms such as the Median Filter for various images and noise levels. The results indicate several interesting invariances in the application of the CA, such as the particular noise realization and the choice of sub-sampling of pixels to determine recombination weights. Additionally, it appears that simpler algorithms for weight optimization which seek local minima work as effectively as those that seek global minima such as Simulated Annealing. © 2017 IEEE.",Cellular Automata; Digital Image Processing; Noise Reduction; Regression weights,Binary images; Bins; Cellular automata; Global optimization; Image processing; Median filters; Noise abatement; Optimization; Simulated annealing; Bitwise operations; Image processing algorithm; Noise realizations; Recombination algorithms; Regression weights; Salt-and-pepper noise; SIMPLER algorithms; Weight optimization; Image denoising,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Ir.

The study of the Computed Tomography (CT) images considers image segmentation a very important and vital part in identifying the different kinds of tumor. The classification of the tumor and the non-tumor images followed by the segmentation of tumor region in CT images is done by the proposed methodology. The process of classifying is carried out by Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernel functions and optimization techniques. This SVM classifier with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is predominant over the other methodologies in the analysis of classification process. The segmentation process after the classification process is performed by the Modified Region Growing (MRG) with threshold optimization. As regards the threshold optimization, certain algorithms such as Harmony Search (HS), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) are made use of. It is with the aid of a wide set of performance measures that the results are demonstrated. The comparative analysis in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy is done for the optimization techniques said supra. An accuracy rate of 99.05% in the analysis of segmentation process is obtained using the GWO technique. It is in the working platform of MATLAB that this proposed methodology is implemented. The experimental results obtained depict that the proposed methodology (MRG-GWO) enjoys high accuracy with enhanced tumor detection in total contrast to the other two techniques (HS and EP) in comparison. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Classification; Feature extraction; Grey Wolf Optimization; Modified region growing; Segmentation; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Support Vector Machine,Classification (of information); Computer programming; Computerized tomography; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; MATLAB; Optimization; Support vector machines; Tomography; Tumors; Classification process; Comparative analysis; Image processing and computer vision; Optimization techniques; Region growing; Segmentation process; Sequential minimal optimization; Threshold optimization; Image segmentation,"Ramakrishnan, T.; Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, National Engineering College, K.R Nagar, Kovilpatti, India; email: tramakrishnanklu@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,1678655,,,,English,Pattern Recogn.

This approach is considered than the other biometric authentication methods such as behavioral biometrics which specially includes Keystroke, Speaker Recognition whereas the another side of biometric authentication is Physical biometrics which specially includes Fingerprint Recognition, Voice Recognition, Finger Geometry Recognition and Facial Recognition. From these considerations, the hybrid approach of Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial for iris recognition has been proposed. The novelty of this proposed method results in improving the Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) for the given iris image. In addition to this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for iris image pre-processing. Circular Hough transform (CHT) and Canny edge detection (CED) are applied for iris image segmentation which segments the individual region of the input images. After the image is segmented, Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial have been applied to extract the features from the segmented iris image, which is the most important step for obtaining the texture details, which are independent and uncorrelated even for identical pairs. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for image classification. Perhaps, Feature extraction and Classification of iris image are mainly based on the rich texture details present in iris image. Finally, our proposed system is applied on UBIRIS database and our research experiment provides better accuracy and recognition rates compared to the combined iris recognition techniques such as Fourier transform with SVM, Bernstein polynomial with SVM, Fourier transform with KSVM, Bernstein polynomial with KSVM and hybridization of Fourier and Bernstein polynomial with SVM. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bernstein polynomial; Canny edge detection; Circular Hough transform; Equal error rate; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Fourier transform; Iris image segmentation; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machine; Uncorrelated texture,Authentication; Biometrics; Classification (of information); Digital filters; Edge detection; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Fourier transforms; Hough transforms; Image classification; Image processing; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Polynomials; Singular value decomposition; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Bernstein polynomial; Canny edge detection; Circular Hough transforms; Equal error rate; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Image texture,"Ramya, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PSG College of TechnologyIndia; email: ramyam7708@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,1678655,,,,English,Pattern Recogn.

Due to its complexity and varied modality, brain MRI needs the automated assessment technique.

Further, TLBO assisted approach is validated on the MICCAI brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) challenge 2012 dataset and achieved better values of Jaccard index, dice co-efficient, precision, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

Images can be wielded to create visual experiences and employ it to solve existing problems. This paper flaunts the fusion of image processing and computer vision by proposing a method to create a prototype of virtual piano that would allow user to play actual piano by just touching its image or projection, showcasing virtual reality. This in turn would help to eradicate the problem of portability of bulky pianos by replacing them with just an 'image', thus making it cost efficient. This whole process is subsumed in stages of extracting piano from a real world image, finding the particular key user touch and then generating corresponding key's sound. This paper also explains the future possibilities of making touch or pressure sensitive piano by using depth sensing techniques. Thus, this paper would open the gates for exploring other possibilities for blending these two techniques to solve other prevailing problems and making life of people easier. © 2017 IEEE.",Computer Vision; Image Processing; Image Segmentation; Virtual Reality,Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Musical instruments; Problem solving; Virtual reality; Computing platform; Depth-sensing techniques; Embryonic stages; Existing problems; Image processing and computer vision; Pressure sensitive; Real-world image; Visual experiences; Image processing,"Saxena, A.; Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology, MeerutIndia; email: ankit@ankitsaxena.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In order to achieve robust heterogeneous system, MB-LBP and MLBP are applied to the individual heterogeneous face images for extracting local features from visible, sketch and NIR face images. These local features are used to capture the structural description of a face image. Feature vectors obtained from these two local descriptors are fused together by concatenation and fused feature vector is passed through the classifier.

It is a multi stage procedure. In our work, it begins with collecting the handwriting samples on plain white A4 size paper. Preprocessing steps such as binarization and noise removal etc are performed for better recognition. Initially color image or gray scale image is taken as an input then thresholding is done to convert the image into binary image and noise removal technique is also applied. Then line segmentation, word segmentation and character segmentation have been performed. After each segmentation process, normalization techniques have been applied for normalization purpose to find out space between lines, words and letters in handwriting images. Finally, the mean of the space between all the closed loops formed by the characters has been found out and compared with the word spaces to determine the character. This paper focuses on determination of behavior based on space analysis in handwritten document. The proposed method was tested on more than 500 text image of IAM database and sample handwriting images which are written by different writers on different backgrounds, detects the exact space in between lines, words and characters before and after skew normalization of a document. The experimental result shows that proposed algorithm achieves more than 63% accuracy for all type skew angles. © 2016 IEEE.",Document Image; Feature Extraction; Line Segmentation; Skew Normalization; Space Analysis; Word Segmentation,Binary images; Bins; Computational linguistics; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image processing; Systems analysis; Document images; Line segmentation; Skew Normalization; Space analysis; Word segmentation; Image segmentation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Enormous storage of data and high-speed computing to customers over the internet can be accomplished using cloud. Security of data in cloud is one of the chief concerns which acts as an obstacle in the realization of cloud computing. Along with quick expansion and application of cloud computing, users concern more and more regarding security and privacy issues involved in these techniques. An efficient method to perform privacy preserving image filtering operations in encrypted domain over cloud is proposed in this paper. The proposed method provides facility for distributed secure processing and storage of the secret image using Shamir's secret sharing method and Chinese remainder theorem. The plain secret image is divided into number of shares in a manner that each share by itself does not reveal any meaningful information about the original image, while collectively, they retain all the information. Two secret keys are used to avail security of image shares and without knowledge of such keys, one cannot restore the secret image back. Hence, the proposed scheme is highly secured and the image can be processed without revealing any information at the cloud data center. Experimental results demonstrate that number of image filtering procedures for enhancement can be carried out efficiently in encrypted domain using the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud computing; encrypted domain processing; image enhancement; secret sharing,Cloud computing; Computation theory; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Image enhancement; Network function virtualization; Security of data; Chinese remainder theorem; Cloud data centers; Domain processing; High speed computing; Original images; Privacy preserving; Secret sharing; Security and privacy issues; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"ISEA Asia Secur.

The multiple reflection and deflection by particles present in the water cause a decrement in visibility and contrast of the image captured by the camera. Distinct attenuation in different component of colour (R, G, B) consequences the colour change in the image. In this paper, a novel systematic approach based on a fractional filter has been used to enhance the low contrast underwater image. The order of the fractional derivative has been chosen adaptively, which largely depends on the presence of the weak and strong edges. Depending upon the amount of attenuation to each light wavelength, the colour change is compensated in order to restore the colour information. The results obtained demonstrate that there is a significant improvement in visibility and colour fidelity. The result has been compared with some state-of-the-art technique and it is observed that the results obtained are at most comparable to the existing technique. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive filtering; Fractional differential; Image enhancement; Tint correction; Underwater image processing,Adaptive filters; Color; Image enhancement; Image processing; Light scattering; Systems analysis; Underwater imaging; Visibility; Colour change; Colour informations; Fractional derivatives; Fractional differential; Fractional filters; Light wavelengths; Multiple reflections; State-of-the-art techniques; Adaptive filtering,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Weeds are one of the considerable menaces to the real home and humankind. They are destroying native habitats, forbidding native plants. Weeds cause decrease in farm and forest yield, invade crops and they can also harm livestock. The only solution to this problem is to avoid the growth of weeds either by removing them or using herbicides. In this proposed automated idea, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is utilized to make out whether plant is crop or weed. The maize crops are continuously monitored by capturing images using camera. In order to classify a plant as a crop or weed, various features are extricated which among them are shape, texture, color. We have made use of statistical textural features such as Intensity, Mean, Energy, Entropy, Standard Deviation, Smoothness and Third Moment. Machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is used for accurate prediction to find out whether the plant is crop or weed. The data-set consists of images of maize crop which are 500 in number and equal number of weed images.

It is changing the way we use and interact with technology. Its application in the mostly used social networking site for ex. IT is used in automatic tag suggestion feature in Face book. Face recognition reduce time in people tagging. As we know everything have some pros and cons same thing is also applied in the case of face recognition. It also has some limitation in real world application. It is brought about by appearance changes, for example, brightening, commotion, debasement, and impediment'. But now in face recognition based on very low resolution is in demand. Limitation of research on this topic is due to many factors which is caused due to environmental changes and recording of devices from distance. Still so many years it is not reachable to the potential of human recognition system. This paper covers the detailed overview or timely survey on the low resolution based on face recognition.

Small fixed Structuring Element (SE) size removes respective bright and dark details during opening and closing morphology & large SE size removes huge contour details of the input image. So, in the proposed MMCWA, by using weighted variance method, the adaptive Structuring Element size of the SE map is obtained to protect all details in the image. A total of 20 features, including 5 shape based features and 15 texture features were extracted for classification using Decision Trees, SVM and KNN classifiers.

The images obtained from imaging devices having different modalities usually provide complementary information. For instance, visible and infrared (IR) images provide complementary information of an object or a scene. Visible images provide the outline of an object or a scene whereas infrared images provide information of some special effects such as hidden objects or persons. Further, color image processing is also gaining importance in most of the real-life applications as color images provide better visual information and are highly suitable for human visual perception. Thus, fusion of visible and infrared images in HSV color space is proposed in the paper. Visual evaluations and objective comparisons on different datasets of visible and infrared images show that the proposed algorithm can effectively combine the information contained in input images and therefore can be successfully utilized in surveillance, military and many other real-life applications. © 2017 IEEE.",fuzzy transform; image fusion; infrared images; visible images,Artificial intelligence; Color; Image enhancement; Image processing; Imaging techniques; Infrared imaging; Military applications; Military photography; Fuzzy transforms; HSV color spaces; Human visual perception; Multiple image; Real-life applications; Visible image; Visual evaluation; Visual information; Image fusion,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In many of the cases the suspects are quite freely escaped because of the insufficient testimonials and lack of communication links in time. As an instance, suppose a bank robbery takes place and right then no one is able to press the emergency buzzer or to dial up to nearest police station. Eventually, when the nearest police station is informed about the fact, the gang is beyond the reach leaving no clue behind. Same is observed in many cases as rash driving and hit and run, Eve teasing and molestation of women at less crowded streets, pick pocketing and blackmailing at Automatic Teller Machines at roadside and many more. Where there is a crime involved, there has to be a quality surveillance and expert actuation to stand against all these activities with minimum human intervention. Our goal is to design an intelligent device that can continuously keep an eye on any activity happening around it and on administrator's request it can track any suspect, be it an object or a human being, with minimum power consumption and least human efforts. As an actuator it sends a signal to the nearest traffic control or police station intimating the state of crime along with its location and also tells about which direction it is heading to.

An appeal of these algorithms is that they are guaranteed to yield the global minimum in probability one sense. The flip side of these algorithms is that they are usually time consuming and also may not reproduce the results consistently. Contrastingly, the currently proposed in this paper, we formulate 2.1D sketch extraction using DIRECT algorithm, which not only apparently aims at providing the better global minimum but as a deterministic approach. Further, the extraction of 2.1D sketch are found to yield comparatively better than the results obtained by the hybrid differential evolution algorithm [1].

The algorithm utilizes a novel distance metric and a unique data element selection criteria to transfer the selected elements between clusters to achieve low intra-cluster variance and subsequently avoid dead centers.

After a survey of various FFT algorithms, because of its pipeline architecture Radix-22 SDF algorithm is chosen as the optimum hardware efficient FFT algorithm. Since the resolution increases with increase in number of samples, a length of 4096 is preferred for the acquisition system (one of the applications of FFT for satellite communication). The system level simulation is performed using MATLAB-Simulink. The algorithm is simulated using HDL programming language. The simulated HDL code is validated using Xilinx ISE synthesizer using Virtex-4 FPGA (XC4VSX35-10FF668). The real time testing of the algorithm is performed with an OFDM system. With inputs of 8 bit, it was found that an accuracy of 99.86% can be obtained. Also for 4096 points, the hardware consumed was 81%.

To ensure a reliable transportation system it is important to have an intelligent traffic control system. The very first step to do that is to acquire traffic data. Traffic data may be acquired from different methods. However in recent days image processing techniques has been very important and promising topic to deal with traffic related problems because of its ease of maintenance and being more intelligent system. Most of the work detects edge of the vehicles and counts the number of traffic on the road. The disadvantage of the method is that counting the number of vehicles may give faulty results when space between the vehicles on the road are very small (i.e. two cars very close to each other may be counted as one vehicle). In this the proposed method firstly, compute the amount of area occupied by vehicles on the road rather than finding number of vehicles. The greater the amount of area occupied by vehicles on the road the greater the amount of traffic congestion. This way every kind of vehicles can be accounted for traffic density. Using this traffic data, the proposed model automatically controls the traffic signalling in a sequential manner depending on the amount of traffic on the road. © 2017 IEEE.",Aurdino; Image processing; Signaling system; Traffic congestion,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Some of the noises which cause a serious degradation in the image quality are multiplicative noise, salt and pepper noise, impulse noise, gaussian noise, additive noise etc. Among these, salt and pepper noise can be eliminated using median filtering techniques. Sorting techniques have been beneficial for median filtering. In this paper a highly efficient optimized sorting algorithm is implemented for median filter. Median filter is used to calculate the median of set of pixel values of a window. To compare the same column pixel values, data is acquired from FPGA parallely. The adjacent median filter results are saved temporarily using D flip-flops. This method increases the efficiency of execution by reducing the comparisons from 21 to 13 and significantly increases 40% efficiency. Sorting algorithm is implemented using FPGA Spartan 6 LX45.

The need for identifying lung cancer at an early stage is very essential and is an active research area in the field of medical image processing. Several Computer aided systems have been intended to distinguish the lung cancer at its initial stage. Various types of images are used for detection of lung diagnosis. The most important challenging task is detection of lung nodule. Computed Tomography (CT) images are generally chosen due to less distortion, low noise, better clarity, less time consumption and low cost. There are different types of the noise present in the images we obtain for the lung mass detection like impulse noise, Gaussian noise and speckle noise.

Proposed model follows twofold working process whereas in first stage image pre-processing is applied to enhance the image quality of image by applying image enhancement with the help of auto-regressive model, second stage performs feature computation by combining morphological, shape and SIFT feature and finally Deep Neural Network is applied for classification performance evaluation. Proposed work is a combination of image enhancement, morphological feature, SIFT feature and classification technique. For efficient image enhancement, auto-regressive model is adopted here.

To match this smartness, our environment needs to become smarter through a technology that is we called Internet of Things. Nowadays, People are switched to follow our ancient culture. Museum is the one of a place where ancient culture and cultural heritage exist, hence it is considered to make a smart museum. To get the attention of visitor in museum it is being proposed as IoT based Smart Museum Environment which will automatically provide the information about artwork without any user intervention. IoT based smart museum relies on a wearable device(Raspberry PI) that will capture the user's movement, does the background subtraction algorithm to perform Image processing and it gets the localization information from a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is fixed in the museum. Hence, this wearable device will increase the performance of the whole system by sending only matched frame to cloud processing center.

Ordinary image thresholding is a class of clustering technique used for image compression because of its simplicity, robustness and accuracy but it is computationally expensive when extending for multilevel image thresholding. An attempt is made in this paper to reduce the computational time of multilevel image thresholding using hybrid gravitational search algorithm and pattern search (hGSA-PS) by optimising a criterion such as Shannon entropy or Fuzzy entropy for seeking appropriate threshold values. From literature, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is designed to explore the global search space (exploitation), and pattern search (PS) is designed to exploit a local search space (exploration), so we hybridise the GSA and PS to achieve exploitation and exploration of search space by incorporating strengths and weakness of both, and results are compared with differential evolution, particle swarm optimisation and bat algorithm and proved better in standard deviation, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), weighted PSNR and reconstructed image quality.

High performance can only be achieved at the cost of high power dissipation. Nowadays, the use of FPGAs is rapidly increasing due to its low cost and smaller time to market. Today’s high end FPGAs are capable of implementing high performance designs such as transceivers for RF application, signal processing and image processing applications etc. This is only possible due to their complex designs that includes on chip dedicated multipliers, Dual RAM blocks, Ethernet and DCMs etc. Since FPGAs consume large amount of power, it becomes a challenge for the designers to implement low power battery operated communication systems. Several power estimation models are available in literature for early stage power estimation of FPGAs in the synthesis design flow but they provide less accuracy (high percentage error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique. This paper presents the limitation of existing power estimation model proposed by Deng. The given model is converted into a script using MATLAB. The power values estimated from the power model (script) are compared with the high level synthesis tool: Xpower Analyzer targeted to Virtex FPGA. For estimation of power values, an embedded multiplier is synthesized for two different configurations: one with ‘CE’ (low power) and another without ‘CE’ for different I/O vector length. The results suggested that the given low level power estimation models provide less accuracy (high % error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique i.e. with ‘CE’. Further, there is a scope of remodel the existing model for the observed shortcoming. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Embedded multiplier; FPGAs; IP block; MATLAB; Power estimation model,Embedded systems; Frequency multiplying circuits; High level synthesis; Image communication systems; Image processing; MATLAB; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Embedded multiplier; High-performance design; Image processing applications; IP block; Low-power synthesis; Power estimations; Wireless communication system; Wireless telecommunication technologies; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA),"Verma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-62, India; email: gaurav.iitkg@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996554617

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other HE-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Annotation; boundaries; dataset; deep learning; nuclear segmentation; nuclei,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Object recognition; Pathology; Quality control; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Tissue; Annotation; dataset; Image processing technique; nuclei; Publicly accessible; Segmentation results; Segmentation techniques; Watershed segmentation; Image segmentation; algorithm; cell nucleus; human; image processing; machine learning; staining; Algorithms; Cell Nucleus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Staining and Labeling","Kumar, N.; IIT GuwahatiIndia; email: neeraj.kumar.iitg@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2780062,,ITMID,28287963,English,IEEE Trans.

There are various problem associates with this topic like low resolution of image, similarity of kidney stone and prediction of stone in the new image of kidney. Ultrasound images have low contrast and are difficult to detect and extract the region of interest. Therefore, the image has to go through the preprocessing which normally contains image enhancement. The aim behind this operation is to find the out the best quality, so that the identification becomes easier. Medical imaging is one of the fundamental imaging, because they are used in more sensitive field which is a medical field and it must be accurate. In this paper, we first proceed for the enhancement of the image with the help of median filter, Gaussian filter and un-sharp masking.

This was overcome by application of fuzzy set for solving different real life problems. Intuitionistic fuzzy set was introduced to handle complex circumstances and to provide better result. Fuzzy set proves its efficiency in field data processing. Minimal structure fuzzy oscillation can be efficiently applied for image processing, especially for face recognition. In this paper we introduce the concept of Intuitionistic fuzzy set or IF Set based minimal structure oscillation. A face database which may be considered as training set, is used to form IF set minimal structure. Again non membership pixel values are also calculated with those pixel values which are used to form IF set minimal structure accordingly. The pixels from membership and nonmembership images are applied to compute two new oscillatory operators. We introduce four new conditions according to the values of the oscillatory operators, which is used for recognition of the face. This new concept can be applied in different types of real life data analysis such as data mining. Along with the theoretical explanation we also presented some experimental results which proves the precision of the face recognition algorithm.

Accuracy of segmentation approach dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process itself i.e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step. Methods To address the above issues, in this paper a fourth order partial differential equation (FPDE) based nonlinear filter adapted to Poisson noise with fuzzy c-means segmentation method is proposed. This approach is capable of effectively handling the segmentation problem of blocky artifacts while achieving good tradeoff between Poisson noise removals and edge preservation of the microscopic biopsy images during segmentation process for cancer detection from cells. Results The proposed approach is tested on breast cancer microscopic biopsy data set with region of interest (ROI) segmented ground truth images. The microscopic biopsy data set contains 31 benign and 27 malignant images of size 896 × 768. The region of interest selected ground truth of all 58 images are also available for this data set. Finally, the result obtained from proposed approach is compared with the results of popular segmentation algorithms; fuzzy c-means, color k-means, texture based segmentation, and total variation fuzzy c-means approaches. Conclusions The experimental results shows that proposed approach is providing better results in terms of various performance measures such as Jaccard coefficient, dice index, Tanimoto coefficient, area under curve, accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, random index, global consistency error, and variance of information as compared to other segmentation approaches used for cancer detection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cell and nuclei segmentation; Fourt order PDE based nonlinear filter; Fuzzy c-means segmentation; Medical image segmentation; Microscopic biopsy images; Segmentation in presence of Poisson noise,"Biopsy; Diseases; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy systems; Image processing; Medical imaging; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear filtering; Poisson equation; Biopsy images; Fourth order partial differential equations; Fuzzy C mean; Nuclei segmentation; Poisson noise; Segmentation algorithms; Segmentation process; Texture-based segmentations; Image segmentation; Article; artifact; benign breast tumor; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; color k means segmentation; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; false negative result; false positive result; fourth order partial differential equation; fuzzy c means segmentation; fuzzy system; image analysis; image segmentation; measurement accuracy; measurement error; noise reduction; nonlinear system; Poisson distribution; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; texture based segmentation; total variation fuzzy c means segmentation; tumor biopsy; algorithm; biopsy; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; human; image processing; neoplasm; Algorithms; Biopsy; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neoplasms","Srivastava, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu UniversityIndia; email: rajeev.cse@iitbhu.ac.in",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28688490,English,Comput.

The feature set is obtained by computing different statistical features from the texture component. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) enhances separability of texture feature classes.

The proposed technique, which is an application of texture feature extraction on transform domain images, gives an overall classification accuracy of 91% for a combination of ten classes of similar looking diseases which is appreciable than the spatial domain only techniques for liver disease classification from ultrasound images. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Decision trees; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image compression; Image processing; Image segmentation; Ultrasonic applications; Wavelet transforms; Active contour segmentation; Biorthogonal wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Co-occurrence-matrix; Computer-based approach; Intensity histograms; Segmented regions; Texture feature extraction; Image texture,"Raghesh Krishnan, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita UniversityIndia; email: k_raghesh@cb.amrita.edu",,Institution of Engineering and Technology,17519659,,,,English,IET Image Proc.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022039190

Analysis, storage and/or transmission of these data demands high compression without any loss of diagnostically significant data. Although, various 3-D compression techniques have been proposed, they have not been able to meet the current requirements. This paper proposes a novel method to compress 3-D medical images based on human vision model to remove visually insignificant information. The block matching algorithm applied to exploit the anatomical symmetry remove the spatial redundancies. The results obtained are compared with those of lossless compression techniques. The results show better compression without any degradation in visual quality. The rate-distortion performance of the proposed coders is compared with that of the state-of-the-art lossy coders.

Reconstructed single photon emission computed tomography images are used to differentiate between subjects with normal value and abnormal value of ejection fraction. The method analyses pixel intensities that correspond to blood flow in the left ventricular region. The algorithm proceeds through three main stages: the initial stage does a pre-processing task to reduce noise as well as blur in the image. The second stage extracts features from the images. Classification is done in the final stage. The pre-processing stage consists of a de-noising part and a de-blurring part. Novel features are used for classification. Features are extracted as three different sets based on: the pixel intensity distribution in different regions, spatial relationship of pixels and multi-scale image information. Two supervised algorithms are proposed for classification: one algorithm is based on a threshold value computed from the features extracted from the training images and the other algorithm is based on sequential minimal optimization-based support vector machine approach. Experimental studies were performed on real cardiac SPECT images obtained from hospital. The result of classification has been verified by an expert nuclear medicine physician and by the ejection fraction value obtained from quantitative gated SPECT, the most widely used software package for quantifying gated SPECT images. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",Constrained least-square filtering; Ejection fraction; Nuclear medicine imaging; Single photon emission computed tomography imaging; Support vector machine,Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computerized tomography; Image classification; Image processing; Nuclear medicine; Optimization; Particle beams; Photons; Pixels; Support vector machines; Tomography; Constrained least squares; Ejection fraction; Nuclear medicine imaging; Pixel based approach; Sequential minimal optimization; Single photon emission computed tomography images; Spatial relationships; Supervised algorithm; Single photon emission computed tomography,"Sasi, N.M.; Model Engineering College, CUSATIndia; email: neethumsasi@gmail.com",,Springer London,18631703,,,,English,Signal Image Video Process.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007189909

This paper presents the usage of NPF in design of Non-Linear Unsharp Masking (UM) framework for the enhancement of X-ray mammograms (digital mammographic images). The UM approach presented consists of operational modules namely: edge preserving and contrast enhancement algorithms which are realized using different variants of NPF. Application of Human Visual System (HVS) based adaptive thresholding during contrast enhancement provides for an effective minimization of background noises. The responses of the different modules are then combined using non-linear fusion operators based on an improved logarithmic model of perception and human vision. The obtained enhancement results demonstrate noteworthy improvement in contrast of lesion region together with better visualization of lesion margins and fine details.

The algorithm overcomes the inherent limitations of the US image modality: Nonuniform density; missing boundaries; and strong speckle noise. We introduced a 'guitar' structure that represents the negative space surrounding the thalamic regions. The guitar acts as a landmark for deriving the widest points of the thalamus even when its boundaries are not identifiable. We augmented a generalized level-set framework with a shape prior and constraints derived from statistical shape models of the guitars; this framework was used to segment US images and measure the thalamic diameter. Our segmentation method achieved a higher mean Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, specificity, and reduced contour leakage when compared to other well-established methods. The automatic thalamic diameter measurement had an interobserver variability of-0.56 2.29 mm compared to manual measurement by an expert sonographer. Our method was capable of automatically estimating the thalamic diameter, with the measurement accuracy on par with clinical assessment.

We are proposing a novel end-to-end deep learning based framework for image super-resolution. This framework simultaneously calculates the convolutional features of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image patches and learns the non-linear function that maps these convolutional features of LR image patches to their corresponding HR image patches convolutional features. Here, proposed deep learning based image super-resolution architecture is termed as coupled deep convolutional auto-encoder (CDCA) which provides state-of-the-art results. Super-resolution of a noisy/distorted LR images results in noisy/distorted HR images, as super-resolution process gives rise to spatial correlation in the noise, and further, it cannot be de-noised successfully. Traditional noise resilient image super-resolution methods utilize a de-noising algorithm prior to super-resolution but de-noising process gives rise to loss of some high-frequency information (edges and texture details) and super-resolution of the resultant image provides HR image with missing edges and texture information. We are also proposing a novel end-to-end deep learning based framework to obtain noise resilient image super-resolution. Proposed end-to-end deep learning based framework for noise resilient super-resolution simultaneously perform image de-noising and super-resolution as well as preserves textural details. First, stacked sparse de-noising auto-encoder (SSDA) was learned for LR image de-noising and proposed CDCA was learned for image superresolution. Then, both image de-noising and super-resolution networks were cascaded. This cascaded deep learning network was employed as one integral network where pre-trained weights were serving as initial weights. The integral network was end-to-end trained or fine-tuned on a database having noisy, LR image as an input and target as an HR image. In fine-tuning, all layers of the combined end-to-end network was jointly optimized to perform image de-noising and super-resolution simultaneously. Experimental results show that proposed noise resilient super-resolution framework outperforms the conventional and state-of-the-art approaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. © 2017 IEEE.",,Convolution; Deep learning; Edge detection; Functions; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Optical resolving power; Signal encoding; Computer vision problems; De-noising algorithm; High resolution image; High-frequency informations; Image super resolutions; Image super-resolution; Spatial correlations; State-of-the-art approach; Image denoising,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,85OFA,,English,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031044939

Content based image classification (CBIC) of these large image datasets calls for the need of dimensionality reduction of features extracted for the purpose. This paper identifies the escalating challenges in the discussed domain and introduces a technique of feature dimension reduction by means of identifying region of interest in a given image with the use of reconstruction errors computed by sparse autoencoders. The automated process identifies the significant regions in an image for feature extraction. It not only improves the dimension of useful features but also contributes to increased classification results compared to earlier approaches. The reduction in number of one kind of features easily makes space for the inclusion of other features whose fusion facilitates improved classification performance compared to individual feature extraction techniques. Two different datasets, i.e. Wang dataset and Corel 5K dataset have been used for the experiments. State-of-the-art classifiers, i.e. Support Vector Machine and Extreme Learning Machine are used for CBIC.

Climatology attempts to analyze and explain the impact of climate so that the society can plan accordingly. Climatology analysis is often done on radar images representing various climatic conditions. These images contain varying scale of severity for any specific climatic parameter of study. The climatologists often find it convenient to analyze climatic conditions if tools are available to segment the weather images based on the severity scale which is represented by different colors. Segmentation of the weather radar image is also used for automated analysis of weather conditions. Differential evolution (DE) approach instead is used for fast selection of optimal threshold. In present paper, we have applied DE with multilevel thresholding for weather image segmentation which results in minimum computational time and excellent image quality. A new mutation strategy for DE named reconstructed differential evolution (RDE) strategy is suggested for better performance over image segmentation. Using fuzzy entropy and RDE for multilevel thresholding provides better results in comparison with last suggested methods. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Fuzzy; Multilevel thresholding; Mutation; Optimization; Radar; Satellite images; Severity,Climatology; Evolutionary algorithms; Image analysis; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Meteorological radar; Optimization; Radar; Fuzzy; Multilevel thresholding; Mutation; Satellite images; Severity; Radar imaging,"Ramadas, M.; Amity University Uttar PradeshIndia; email: meera_mgr@rediffmail.com",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

Real time face image capturing along with eye gaze tracking can provide a means of user input to the computer. Here we combine an efficient method for tracking eye and detecting blink to produce an environment by which physically disabled persons can access the computer very easily. Our aim is to minimize the hardware and setup cost by using accurate image processing techniques. The system will track the eye of a person by camera and process them to control the mouse pointer on the screen. The user can control the mouse by moving and blinking the eye. The system use isophote eye center detection method to find the iris. It gives an accuracy of 99.20%. The curves that connect the points of equal intensities are called isophote. Binary equivalent image is used to perform blink detection, in which number of black pixels is counted to determine the blinking of eye.

External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) is a type of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy mainly includes three phases-treatment planning, treatment plan evaluation and treatment delivery. During the treatment plan phase, the organs at risk in the respective cancer context need to be segmented from acquired medical images. In the yester years, the segmentation of target and the organs at risk was done by the doctor himself which is very tedious. But now, with the developments in the fields of technology, computerized algorithms are used for the purpose of delineating the organs at risk. The images used for treatment planning are usually CT images. This is because, the density information obtained in CT is used directly for dose calculation. In this work, rectum is segmented from CT images and segmented rectum images are useful in the treatment plan.

In fixed-value impulse noise, the gray value is a fixed value, i.e., either 0 or 255 (example: Salt and pepper noise). Digital signal processing frequently involves some method for noise reduction over an image. The median filter is a non-linear digital filter, which is most popularly used to remove impulse noises. Many popular algorithms were presented which eliminates impulse noises present and maintains the fine details of the image. But, median filter fails to preserves the edges of the image by uniform modification of the noise affected pixels and the noise-free pixels. Also, the conventional filters work better only over images affected with low noise ratios and is very poor when the noise ratio reaches above 40%. The proposed de-noising algorithm uses an adaptive Gaussian filters for removal of salt and pepper noise. As conventional de-noising algorithm fails at high noise density and in preserving edges along with image details the proposed technique switches between mask sizes depending noise density. To preserve edges and details of the image Adaptive threshold is employed. Advantage of adaptive threshold filtering does not affect the edges or other small structures in the image. Hence this method is more efficient for the images with very high noise ratio and preserving edges. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive Gaussian filters; Salt and Pepper noise; System generator; Xilinx ISE,Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gaussian distribution; Image acquisition; Image processing; Impulse noise; Integrated circuit design; Median filters; Optimization; Pixels; Pulse shaping circuits; Salt removal; Signal processing; Adaptive threshold filtering; De-noising algorithm; Design and implementations; Fixed-value impulse noise; Gaussian filters; Salt-and-pepper noise; System Generator; Xilinx ISE; Edge detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A very important and primary step in automatic detection of abnormalities in brain MRI images is reliable elimination of presence of the noise in the acquired images. Evaluation of the various noise removal algorithms to estimate the noise parameters is widely recognized as a typical standards for medical image processing solicitations. Validation of such brain MRI images can be done based on the evaluation through various statistical noise parameters. But the enactment of noise removal procedure profoundly depend on superiority of input brain MRI images and image processing skills employed for restoring original quality of brain MRI image by eliminating noises present in it and make the input image free from noises. This paper projects the type of noise existing in the brain MRI images and also removal of noises from the images using different types of noise elimination filters. The work proposes the design and implementation of the simple and efficient filtering technique for removal of noises in medical images specifically for brain MRI images and to upsurges the performance capabilities of the method. The experimental outcomes of suggested filtering algorithm are compared with the additional existing filtering approaches.

To achieve this, we proposed a wavelet based hybrid image denoising. In which, after wavelet decomposition of a noisy image both the approximation and the detail coefficients are incorporated into modification. Approximation coefficients are processed by the Cloud Model (CM) and estimated by the fuzzy mean without omitting the contribution of an individual. The detail parts undergo sub band based adaptive modified firm thresholding. Finally, the image is treated with an Adaptive Wiener filter, to further improve its visual quality.

This work reports techniques to improve recognition of embryo features such as circular shape, width of edges of the detected cells, alignment of 4-cell and 8-cell structures of the blastomere, etc leading to the goal of blastomere segmentation. Paper describes a method for the detection of cell cleavage quality of human blastomere via image processing. Boundaries or ridges of blastomeres are first extracted by Hessian-based ridge detector followed by non-maxima suppression and hysteresis thresholding. Hough circle transform is applied to the acquired boundaries to detect the presence of Oocytes/embryos with due consideration of boundary orientation. Then a screening algorithm is used to verify the detected embryo cells' circles. Finally, the location of validated cells is approximated with circles and ellipses. The higher order filtering methods such as Multi-Scale structures or second order confined structure of an image (Hessian) may be used to get precise parameters for the implementation of vessel enhancement filter which in turn can identify the ridges in the embryo images. © 2016 IEEE.",Blastomere; Hessian-based ridge detector; Hysteresis thresholding; IVF; Non-maxima suppression; Vessel filtering,Cytology; Hysteresis; Image classification; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Automated classification; Blastomere; Boundary orientation; Hysteresis thresholding; Multi-scale structures; Non-maxima suppressions; Screening algorithms; Vessel enhancement filter; Cells,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To perform context based offloading depends upon the need of mobile situation whether to offload data or not. Considering an image processing application that should be processed in a mobile phone. To do this, a mobile phone should utilize maximum computational resource. Hence we enable temporary cloud to access local server to do this process.

The estimation of age can be refined by considering both geometrical measures and texture analysis. The steps to be followed are normalization, face cropping, filtering, feature extraction and finally classification to provide the refined age of the face image. The normalization of face is done using histogram equalization to study the intensity component. From the image the face is cropped. The median filter is applied on the image to detach noise in the image and to maintain the edge details. The requisite features are extracted from the image such as geometric measures, texture details. The structure of texture features and the intensity transitions are analyzed.

The quality of the sample may degrade as the days pass till it finally reaches the consumers. The quality of a post harvested fish is determined mainly by two important factors namely climatic conditions and holding time. This paper presents a completely automated computer vision based segmentation of fish gills from digital images of fish samples. Post segmentation, a statistical relationship of the segmented gill region is established to design an assessment model for fish freshness identification. The fish gills are segmented using various strategic image processing techniques like contrast enhancement, adaptive intensity threshold and active contour based methods. The model for fish freshness testing is based on the image statistical features which are derived from the gills region of the saturation channel. The variation of the statistical distribution is observed to be decreasing monotonic which is basis for design of the framework for fish quality and freshness identification. This process being non-destructive provides an efficient fish quality assessment scheme in real time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Active contour; Color space conversion; Fish freshness; Fish gills; Image processing; Threshold,Computer vision; Fish; Image segmentation; Active contours; Color space conversion; Fish freshness; Image processing technique; Image statistical features; Statistical distribution; Statistical relationship; Threshold; Image processing; climate conditions; digital image; fish; identification method; image processing; numerical method; numerical model; segmentation; statistical distribution,"Dutta, M.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity UniversityIndia; email: malaykishoredutta@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,1681699,,CEAGE,,English,Comput.

Besides, multi-oriented of text lines in natural scene images make the problem more challenging. This paper proposes to explore ring radius transform (RRT) for text detection in multi-oriented and multi-script environments. The method finds component regions based on convex hull to generate radius matrices using RRT. It is a fact that RRT provides low radius values for the pixels that are near to edges, constant radius values for the pixels that represent stroke width, and high radius values that represent holes created in background and convex hull because of the regular structures of text components. We apply k-means clustering on the radius matrices to group such spatially coherent regions into individual clusters. Then the proposed method studies the radius values of such cluster components that are close to the centroid and far from the centroid to detect text components. Furthermore, we have developed a Bangla dataset (named as ISI-UM dataset) and propose a semi-automatic system for generating its ground truth for text detection of arbitrary orientations, which can be used by the researchers for text detection and recognition in the future. The ground truth will be released to public.

Existing methods concentrate either on robust feature extraction or view-invariant feature transformation. However, the extracted features suffer from various limitations such as color inconsistency and scale variations. Besides, during matching, a probe is compared against each gallery instance which represents only the pairwise relationship and ignores the high order relationship among them. To address these issues, we propose a multi-shot person re-identification framework that first performs a preprocessing task on images to address illumination variations for maintaining the color consistency. Subsequently, we formulate an approach to handle scale variations in the pedestrian appearances for keeping them with relatively a fixed scale ratio. Overlapped visual patches representing appearance cues are then extracted from the processed images. A structured multi-class feature selection approach is employed to select a set of relevant patches that simultaneously discriminates all distinct persons. These selected patches use a hypergraph to represent the visual association among a probe and gallery images. Finally, for matching, we formulate a hypergraph-based learning scheme, which considers both the pairwise and high-order association among the probe and gallery images. The hypergraph structure is then optimized to yield an improved similarity score for a probe against each gallery instance. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated on three public datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art methods shows the superior performance of our framework. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Hypergraph learning; Illumination variations; Multi-camera; Multi-class group LASSO; Person re-identification; Scale variations; Video surveillance,Cameras; Feature extraction; Probes; Security systems; Class group; Hypergraph; Illumination variation; Multi-cameras; Person re identifications; Scale variations; Video surveillance; Image processing,"Nanda, A.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: aparajita1.nanda@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020435885

Detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma and Edema are the ones in which OD detection finds the meaning and need. The method proposed here introduces a unique concept of fractal analysis in its own way, exploiting the geometric structure of eye called Pixel Based Multi Fractal Analysis (PBMFA). At the very outset the retinal fundus images are pre-processed employing a modified Contrast Limit Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method. Furthering Mean Based Localization is carried out on the pre-processed image to locate the Region of Interest (ROI) over which further processes are carried out helping in improvising time complexity and efficiency of the algorithm developed. Modified Canny Edge detection leveraged with Gabor operator is performed over the ROI located, resulting in extraction of blood vessels from the retinal image. Pixel Based Multi Fractal Analysis is done locating the origin of vascular tree (center of the OD), based on the fact that it carries highest fractal dimension. This helps us locate the center most accurately followed by which OD of the retinal image is traced. This algorithm was implemented on DSK6713T making it a real time system and also an end product ready. Hardware implementation results in improvisation of the time complexity of the system too. An evaluation of the proposed algorithm was run over a set of 50 images each from STARE, MESSIDOR and DRIVE projects, containing images from both normal and pathological subjects. Detection and tracing of Optic Disc was found to be accurate up to 98.66%.

In this brief a decision tree based method (DTBM) is presented which effectively removes random valued impulse noise from gray scale images. The pixels corrupted by noise are detected by an impulse detector and are reconstructed using an edge preserving image filter. The reconstructed pixels are written back in an adaptive manner so that they will be available for the next computation. The desirable feature of DTBM is that the design requires simple mathematical computations which results in a cost effective implementation of the system. The quantifiable evaluation and visual quality results of the presented system prove that the system's performance is good in both respects. Image enhancement is done on the denoised image using discrete cosine transform (DCT) which improves the visual quality of the image. © 2016 IEEE.,DCT; DTBM; Image enhancement; Random impulse noise,Decision trees; Discrete cosine transforms; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image processing; Impulse noise; Pixels; Cost-effective implementations; Desirable features; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); DTBM; Mathematical computation; Random impulse; Random-valued impulse noise; System's performance; Image denoising,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

But hyper spectral imaging perceives information from across the electromagnetic spectrum; the process of spectral imaging further splits the spectrum into more bands. This process of changing images into bands can be even in the invisible spectrum. Hence the hyper spectral images can be considered as n-dimensional matrices and each pixel can be regarded as n-dimens ional vector. These images contain various areas with similar characteristics like crop fields, forest area and deserts. To classify such regions one has look for certain features among the captured images. Some similarity measures should be undertaken to make clusters of areas having similar characteristics from the images. Finding the relative similarities in terms of numerical score can be carried out with the help of some standard algorithm. So, feature classification on basis of relative similarities pixel is robust method.

In contrast to these, our lower cost SoC tool based on DSP architecture offers a higher speed image segmentation process with co-relating performance. Thus, it also eliminates the need for higher computing resources on the host machine by using a Hardware accelerator called 'Pipeline Vision Processor' of an optimized Dual Core Digital Signal Processor. This architecture offers a high performance enhanced infrastructure with large on-chip memory and reduces the overall bandwidth requirement leading to accelerated imaging. We have cross-validated the performance of this tool by evaluating 27 medical case studies with thyroid medical history. As compared to diagnosis by propriety SIEMENS software or segmentation tools based on MATLAB, our hardware accelerated approach has shown a drastic reduction of computational time of about 250% with superior correlation. This SoC tool can be extended and realized for various other Medical Imaging procedures like Kidney's Glomerular Filtration Rate and Myocardial Perfusion studies of Heart. © 2016 IEEE.",Digital Signal Processing (DSP); Medical Imaging; Pipelined Vision Processor (PVP); System on Chip (SoC),Biomedical equipment; Computer hardware; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Hardware; Image processing; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Pipeline processing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; Single photon emission computed tomography; System-on-chip; Bandwidth requirement; Computational resources; Digital signal processing (DSP); Glomerular filtration rate; Hardware accelerators; Image segmentation process; System on chips (SoC); Vision processor; Integrated circuit design,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

First symptom of this disease is seen in joints of hand finger and wrist joints thus making hand radiograph analysis extremely important. Lately Reading hand X-ray radiographic image to measure joint space width is very tedious and time consuming task for the radiologist since there are 14 joints in hand and also the structure of hand is complicated to carry out joint space width measurement and analysis. It has certain disadvantages like inaccuracy because of visual measurement and also variation from one reader to another, which can be overcome by automatic technique that can serve as a powerful aid for peoples suffering from disability due to pain, stiffness in joints. In this paper, Image processing based algorithm is developed to yield solution to two major problems joint detection and JSW measurement. The algorithm is divided into following steps, First image preprocessing is carried out using Gaussian filter. Second hand mask is extracted by separating foreground and background by using Otsu's binarization method. Third morphological thinning is applied to get thinned skeleton of binarized image. Fourth To detect joint location in original X-ray image Gabor filter is used. Fifth edge Finally of minimal joint space width is extracted and analyzed automatically. We have experimented 10 digital hand X-ray radiograph of resolution 2000pixels×2000pixels and calculated 120 readings of JSW of finger joints successfully. © 2016 IEEE.",Arthritis; Joint space narrowing; Joint space width; X-ray,Bins; Diseases; Gabor filters; Pixels; Radiography; X ray radiography; X rays; Arthritis; Automatic technique; Inflammatory disease; Joint space narrowing; Joint space width; Radiographic images; Time-consuming tasks; Visual measurements; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This paper represents a hybrid approach which combines the Sobel and Canny edge detectors. It also uses a median filter to remove the salt and pepper noise from the image which consequently smoothen the image and edges can be detected easily. A comparison has also been shown between the hybrid approach with median filter and without median filter. The comparative study shows that using median filter shows enhanced result.

The hybrid model thus formed outperforms the separate singular models. Furthermore, the task of analysis of color emotions of the artistic image helps to gain further insights of the said classes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Abstract art; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Image processing; Machine learning; Neural networks,Artificial intelligence; Arts computing; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Education; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Learning systems; Neural networks; Visual languages; Abstract arts; Abstract paintings; Convolutional neural network; Degree of independence; Digital image; Hybrid model; Systematic method; Visual reference; Deep learning,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

In this approach, instead of extracting the features of the whole query image, features of the objects of interest are extracted. For this, some morphological operations are performed on the image. First, background subtraction is performed to reduce the effect of background intensities, then segmentation is performed and the regions are extracted. To minimize the number of comparisons in image retrieval process, the image is categorized into texture and non texture regions. This reduces the retrieval time by comparing the ROI on the basis of its category. During the feature extraction process, a flag is set to indicate the category of the image i.e. texture image or non-texture (natural) image. Feature vector of an image is stored along with respective objects within the image. Tetrolet transform is used to retrieve the texture features for the texture regions while moment invariants and edge features are used for non-texture regions. The performance and efficiency of the proposed system is tested on COREL and CIFAR databases. Experimental results show that the retrieval performance of the proposed algorithm is better in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",CBIR; Image retrieval; OBIR; RBIR; Tetrolet,Feature extraction; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Background subtraction; CBIR; Morphological operations; OBIR; Object-based image retrieval; RBIR; State-of-the-art methods; Tetrolet; Image texture,"Tyagi, V.; Department of CSE, Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology, Raghogarh, India; email: dr.vipin.tyagi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979272950

Multiplication is a ubiquitous thirsty area to perform arithmetic operations in DSP applications and researchers have found that LNS is the possible solution for multiplication to be performed for a DSP application. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Improved Operand Decomposition (IOD) to make an efficient logarithmic multiplier and subsequent achievement through scale realization. The Pipeline technique and the efficient correction circuit are used for error minimization at the cost of minimal hardware and delay.

Simulation results show that the proposed IOD method for logarithmic multiplication without the pipelining gives maximum of 35.39% less ADP and 11.15% less EPS for 32-bit architecture than of the reported logarithmic multiplier architecture. The proposed IOD based logarithmic multiplier with the pipelining gives a maximum of 20.17% less ADP for 8-bit architecture and 21.72% for 32-bit architecture than of the reported iterative pipelined architecture of logarithmic multiplier.

Furthermore, imaging modalities have also been developed to a great extent. Interestingly, computers help doctors to interpret medical images in the diagnosis process and thus the area of Computer Aided/Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) is born.

Not so long ago, this digital information (images and videos especially) savored the unique status of ‘definitive proof of occurrence of events’. However, given their susceptibility to malicious modifications, this status is rapidly depreciating. In sensitive areas like intelligence and surveillance, reliance on manipulated visual data could be detrimental. The disparity between the ever-growing importance of digital content and the suspicions regarding their vulnerability to alterations has made it necessary to determine whether or not the contents of a given digital image or video can be considered trustworthy. Digital videos are prone to several kinds of tamper attacks, but on a broad scale these can be categorized as either inter-frame forgeries, where the arrangement of frames in a video is manipulated, or intra-frame forgeries, where the contents of the individual frames are altered. Intra-frame forgeries are simply digital image forgeries performed on individual frames of the video. Upscale-crop and splicing are two intra-frame forgeries, both of which are performed via an image processing operation known as resampling. While the challenge of resampling detection in digital images has remained at the receiving end of much innovation over the past two decades, detection of resampling in digital videos has been regarded with little attention. With the intent of ameliorating this situation, in this paper, we propose a forensic system capable of validating the authenticity of digital videos by establishing if any of its frames or regions of frames have undergone post-production resampling. The system integrates the outcomes of pixel-correlation inspection and noise-inconsistency analysis; the operation of the system as a whole overcomes the limitations usually faced by these individual analyses. The proposed system has been extensively tested on a large dataset consisting of digital videos and images compressed using different codecs at different bit-rates and scaling factors, by varying noise and tampered region sizes. Empirical evidence gathered over this dataset suggests good efficacy of the system in different forensic scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Digital video forensics; Forgery detection; Noise inconsistency; Pixel correlation; Sensor pattern noise; Surveillance video authentication,Authentication; Computer crime; Crops; Digital forensics; Forensic engineering; Image processing; Multimedia systems; Pixels; Security systems; Video signal processing; Digital video forensics; Forgery detections; Noise inconsistency; Sensor pattern noise; Surveillance video; Computer graphics,"Singh, R.D.; University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: raahat.singh@hotmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17422876,,,,English,Digit.

Region-difference filters evaluate maximum difference of the average of two regions of the window around the center pixel. Implementing the filters on the whole image gives region-difference image. This image is then converted into binary image and morphologically operated for segmenting the desired lesion from the ultrasound image. The proposed method is compared with the maximum a posteriori-Markov random field (MAP-MRF), Chan-Vese active contour method (CV-ACM), and active contour region-scalable fitting energy (RSFE) methods. MATLAB code available online for the RSFE method is used for comparison whereas MAP-MRF and CV-ACM methods are coded in MATLAB by authors. Since no comparison is available on common database for the performance of the three methods, therefore, performance comparison of the three methods and proposed method was done on liver US images obtained from PGIMER, Chandigarh, India and from online resource. A radiologist blindly analyzed segmentation results of the 4 methods implemented on 56 images and had selected the segmentation result obtained from the proposed method as best for 46 test US images.

Image fusion aims to integrate complementary as well as redundant information from multiple modalities into a single fused image without distortion or loss of information. In this research work, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT)-based fusion techniques using genetic algorithm (GA) for optimal parameter (weight) estimation in the fusion process are implemented and analyzed with multi-modality brain images. The lack of shift variance while performing image fusion using DWT is addressed using UDWT. The proposed fusion model uses an efficient, modified GA in DWT and UDWT for optimal parameter estimation, to improve the image quality and contrast. The complexity of the basic GA (pixel level) has been reduced in the modified GA (feature level), by limiting the search space. It is observed from our experiments that fusion using DWT and UDWT techniques with GA for optimal parameter estimation resulted in a better fused image in the aspects of retaining the information and contrast without error, both in human perception as well as evaluation using objective metrics. The contributions of this research work are (1) reduced time and space complexity in estimating the weight values using GA for fusion (2) system is scalable for input image of any size with similar time complexity, owing to feature level GA implementation and (3) identification of source image that contributes more to the fused image, from the weight values estimated. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Discrete wavelet transform; Genetic algorithm; Image fusion; Objective metrics; Undecimated discrete wavelet transform,Algorithms; Brain mapping; Discrete wavelet transforms; Genetic algorithms; Image fusion; Image processing; Medical imaging; Wavelet transforms; Fusion techniques; Identification of sources; Multiple modalities; Objective metrics; Optimal parameter; Optimal parameter estimation; Time and space complexity; Undecimated discrete wavelet transforms; Parameter estimation,"Thyagharajan, K.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, RMD Engineering CollegeIndia; email: kkthyagharajan@yahoo.com",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955258379

In this paper, a novel RDH scheme for digital images is proposed that has high capacity with low distortion. The cover image is divided into blocks and all the pixels in the block are converted into odd value or even value by computing the optimal value of the block. The optimal value is mean, median, max histogram or min–max average which is very nearer to the pixels in the block. Secret data is directly embedded into blocks using odd even property.

However, such cloud-based systems possess security issues as third party servers become involved in them. Rendering data in an unreadable form so that no information is revealed to the cloud data centers will serve as the best solution to these security issues. One such image encryption scheme based on a Permutation Ordered Binary Number System has been proposed in this work. It distributes the image information in totally random shares, which can be stored at the cloud data centers. Further, the proposed scheme authenticates the shares at the pixel level. If any tampering is done at the cloud servers, the scheme can accurately identify the altered pixels via authentication bits and localizes the tampered area. The tampered portion is also reflected back in the reconstructed image that is obtained at the authentic user end. The experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme against various kinds of possible attacks, tested with a variety of images. The tamper detection accuracy has been computed on a pixel basis and found to be satisfactorily high for most of the tampering scenarios. © 2017 ACM.",Encrypted domain; Permutation ordered binary (POB) number system; Secret sharing,Bins; Cryptography; Image processing; Multimedia systems; Numbering systems; Pixels; Authentication bits; Binary number systems; Cloud data centers; Encrypted domain; Image encryption scheme; Number system; Reconstructed image; Secret sharing; Distributed computer systems,,,Association for Computing Machinery,15516857,,,,English,ACM Trans.

Image fusion is important in medical imaging, specifically for the purpose of detecting the tumor and identification of diseases. In this article, completely unique discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) based fusion method (DWT-IFS) is proposed. For fusion, initially, all source images are fused using DWT with the average, maximum, and entropy fusion rules. Besides, on the fused image IFS is applied. In the IFS process images are converted into intuitionistic fuzzy images (IFIs) by selecting an optimum value for the parameter in membership, non-membership, and hesitation degree function using entropy. Then, the resulting IFIs are decomposed into the blocks, and the corresponding blocks of the images are fused using the intersection and union operations of IFS. The efficiency of the proposed DWT-IFS fusion method is recognized by examining it with other existing methods, such as Averaging (AVG), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Laplacian Pyramid Approach (LPA), Contrast Pyramid Approach (CPA), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Morphological Pyramid Approach (MPA), Redundancy Discrete Wavelet Transform (RDWT), Contourlet Transform (CONTRA), and Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) using subjective and objective performance evaluation measures.

The optimum window size is determined by modeling the entropy values by a two-mode Gaussian mixture model and checking for the minimum entropy of the mode-probabilities. The outlier entropy values corresponding to defective areas are defined as those that exceed thrice the standard deviation, as is the norm in statistics. The result is automatic defect detection with no manual intervention.

The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively.

DAC-MSS builds a multi-category classifier model organized in the form of a tree of binary classifiers. The tree consists of several TW-LKSC classifiers which use a training set consisting of few labeled samples and rest unlabeled samples to generate a pair of hyperplanes, by solving a system of linear equations. The propagation of labels to unlabeled patterns is achieved through localized kernel spectral clustering (LKSC) which is the core clustering model embedded in TW-LKSC. TW-LKSC also employs cluster prototype to localize the generation of hyperplanes and prevents them from extending infinitely. The strength of DAC-MSS is its better classification accuracy and improved learning time, due to divide and conquer approach, as compared to one-against-all based semi-supervised classification algorithms. This is proved experimentally for benchmark UCI datasets.

Due to the massive amount of data generated by optical frontend, storing the raw data for offline post-processing is slow and impractical for the targeted single cell analysis applications. The proposed FPGA solution eliminates the need to transfer and persist the entire raw data by processing low-level signals and forming highlevel images in real-time. Objects of interest are detected and segmented from the image stream and a classifier subsequently performs high-level analysis on the segmented images. When compared with existing software-based post-processing workflow, this FPGA-based approach will improve both the number of objects captured per experiment and the overall end-to-end object classification performance. The system also allows co-optimization between optical system, low-level signal processing and image analytic in a unified environment that enables new scientific discoveries previously unachievable. © 2016 IEEE.",,Data handling; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image processing; Object recognition; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Optical systems; Signal processing; Classification system; High-level analysis; Object classification; Optical front-ends; Post processing; Scientific discovery; Segmented images; Singlecell analysis; Object detection,,Li J.Song Y.Peng Y.Nelson B.Wang S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The image of the object to be recognized is captured using camera and matched with pre-stored templates of the model object. Recognizing 3D view of the object is difficult in the presence of object occlusion and view-point invariants. This paper focuses on the problem of occlusion and provides a solution for handling self and inter-object occlusion. Self-occlusion has been addressed by the suitable calibration of the cameras and a novel algorithm has been proposed to address inter-object occlusion. A modified geometric mapping technique has been proposed for the 3D reconstruction of the recognized object. Real-time setup has been used to test the proposed solutions to identify objects of multiple shapes and sizes.

In this manuscript, we introduce a novel supervised dimensionality reduction approach, moments discriminant analysis, which models linear relationships between the high-dimensional input space and a low-dimensional space by maximizing the discrimination between second order raw moments of different classes to improve the generalization capability of a classifier. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, moments discriminant analysis is intended to accommodate data distributions that may be multimodal and non-Gaussian. Initially, experiments using synthetic random data (generated from different probability distributions) are performed to prove the efficiency of the proposed method for multimodal and non-Gaussian data with the help of five separability measures. Also, extensive experimental results on UCI machine learning repository and image retrieval on WANG and MIT (Oliva and Torralba) databases are carried out in order to exhibit the effectiveness of moments discriminant analysis over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Dimensionality reduction; Image retrieval; Kernel; Projection space; Statistical moments; Subspace learning,Discriminant analysis; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image retrieval; Learning systems; Dimensionality reduction; Kernel; Projection space; Statistical moments; Subspace learning; Probability distributions; Article; classification algorithm; data base; discriminant analysis; image processing; intermethod comparison; linear system; machine learning; moments discriminant analysis; probability; statistical model; supervised dimensionality reduction,"Murthy, K.R.; Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: k.ramachandra@isical.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,9252312,,NRCGE,,English,Neurocomputing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014409957

Optimization of such a process requires a thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic process which happens during impingement of the droplet on the surface. Image processing techniques can be employed to understand the process. Image processing is converting an image into digital form and analyzing it, to get an improved image and extracting the desired information from it. The technique is widely used in face detection, remote sensing applications, machine vision and industrial robotics. In the present work an image processing algorithm is developed for a specific surface cooling technique. A hot surface is treated by impinging droplets. The size of the droplets can alter the material characteristics significantly. The objective of the present work is to develop an image processing algorithm to find the droplet dimensions. The variation in radius and height is examined with the help of Matlab software. Edge detection techniques are used to determine the boundaries of the droplet clearly.

Hence the broadcast of electronic medical images over internet has become frequent. Due to lack of security levels in internet broadcast of electronic medical image is always susceptible to hackers and other breaches of security. Ensuring the security, integrity and robustness of digital medical image has become an important issue. In this paper a novel approach is proposed using Chao's theories and DNA encoding to provide the security for digital medical images. In the proposed method, firstly the input medical image is revamped into two DNA encoded matrices based on intensity levels. Later, for odd pixel value based DNA encoded matrix Chen's hyper chaotic map and for even pixel value based DNA encoded matrix Lorenz chaotic map are used to produce the chaotic sequences separately. The pixels positions of both DNA encoded matrices are snarled using these chaotic sequences. Finally, ADD operation is used for the addition of snarled both DNA encoded matrices to attain an encrypted image. The decrypted image is acquired by inverse process of encryption. From the experimental results it is proved that proposed algorithm enhances the security level. It sustains the integrity, robustness and efficiency of digital medical image encryption. © 2016 IEEE.",Chen's hyper chaotic map; Cryptography; decryption; DNA; medical mage encryption,Artificial intelligence; Broadcasting; Chaotic systems; Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital communication systems; DNA; DNA sequences; Image coding; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Medical imaging; Personal computing; Pixels; Chaotic map; Chaotic sequence; decryption; Digital communication networks; Digital medical images; Dna cryptographies; Internet broadcast; Medical image encryptions; Medical image processing,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In the proposed algorithm, medical images are embedded as watermark into a special cover image. In this process, the cover image is transformed by discrete wavelet transform and the LL sub-band obtained, is then transformed by discrete cosine transform. Watermark generation and embedding is performed by modifying the transformed coefficients of watermark and cover image by varying the value of scaling factor. Finally inverse discrete cosine and discrete wavelet transforms are applied on modified sub-bands to obtain the watermarked image. Watermark extraction is done using an extraction algorithm. Various quality parameters have been used to test and evaluate the performance of the proposed method for varying scale factors and different set of images.

This document aims to extract image frames from a streaming CCTV footage, recognize the vehicle number and convert it into its corresponding text format. Template matching has been used earlier in recognition of digits and letters, this paper also uses the concept of template matching methodology using a SIMULINK model in MATLAB which is developed to extract the vehicle number from the number plate. The alphanumeric values are extracted from the image containing the number plate, one after the other, and are matched with its corresponding template with the help of the template matching methodology. This template matching block compares each and every pixel value of the original image with the pixel values of the corresponding stored template and returns a template metrics value as an output. The templates stored in the model consists or various fonts in English as well as templates of some of the widely used languages (22 official languages) across India.

In such signal and image processing sections Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) plays an important role as robust local invariant feature descriptor for object recognition. To further improve the recognition and subsequently the retrieval, Sparse coding using SIFT features are performed using a novel approach as Linear Spatial Pyramid Matching which improves the object recognition such as images or data. The content of the image is extracted using SIFT. Sparse feature representations for the SIFT features are then computed using the learned dictionary. These representations are further pooled via spatial pyramid matching kernels which have a fixed dimension feature vectors that represents the whole image. The SPM is used to maximum pool the local features from the images and improves the spatial information. The proposed method effectively represents the features of the images and these features are used in image retrieval. Based on the query image, the Euclidean distance is calculated with database images and similar images are resulted.

Flooding is a constant threat to humanity and reliable systems for flood monitoring and analysis need to be developed. Flood hazard assessment needs to take into account physical characteristics such as flood depth, flow velocity and the duration of flooding. This paper provides the researchers with a detailed compilation of the methods that can be used for the estimation of flood water depth. A comparative study has been done between the water depth estimation techniques based on image processing and those which does not involve image processing. The comparison is based on various attributes such as implementation methods, advantages, accuracy and cost. Image processing methods are classified based on various algorithms such as character recognition, feature extraction, region of interest (ROI), FIR filter etc. Similarly, non-image processing methods are classified based on hardware used such as sensors, level indicators, etc., and other signal based techniques.

The detection is based on finding abnormalities, such as exudates and red lesions, and the grading is based on the location of these abnormalities in the image referred with its distance from the macula. Accordingly the entire image has been divided into regions and occurrence of abnormalities in these regions indicates the severity of the disease.

One of the tradition and most widely used clustering algorithm is k-Means clustering algorithm, but this algorithm fails to find structural similarity in the data or if the data is non-linear. Spectral clustering is a graph clustering method in which the nodes are clustered and useful if the data is non-linear and it finds clusters of different shapes. A spectral graph is constructed based on the affinity matrix or similarity matrix and the graph cut is found using Laplacian matrix. Traditional spectral clustering use Gaussian kernel function to construct a spectral graph. In this paper we implement PCA based similarity measure for graph construction and generated different Laplacian graphs for spectral clustering. In PCA based similarity measure, the similarity measure based on eigenvalues and its eigenvectors is used for building the graph and we study the efficiency of two types of Laplacian graph matrices. This graph is then clustered using spectral clustering algorithm. Effect of PCA similarity measure is analyzed on two types of Laplacian graphs i.e., un-normalized Laplacian and normalized Laplacian. The outcome shows accurate result of PCA measure on these two Laplacian graphs. It predicts perfect clustering of non-linear data.

It plays a major role in the field of biomedical applications as it is widely used by the radiologists to segment the medical images input into meaningful regions. In recent years, various brain tumour detection techniques are presented in the literature. The entire segmentation process of our proposed work comprises three phases: threshold generation with dynamic modified region growing phase, texture feature generation phase and region merging phase. by dynamically changing two thresholds in the modified region growing approach, the first phase of the given input image can be performed as dynamic modified region growing process, in which the optimisation algorithm, firefly algorithm help to optimise the two thresholds in modified region growing. After obtaining the region growth segmented image using modified region growing, the edges can be detected with edge detection algorithm. In the second phase, the texture feature can be extracted using entropy-based operation from the input image. In region merging phase, the results obtained from the texture feature-generation phase are combined with the results of dynamic modified region growing phase and similar regions are merged using a distance comparison between regions. After identifying the abnormal tissues, the classification can be done by hybrid kernel-based SVM (Support Vector Machine).

Some of those drawbacks are alleviated by providing same identity for multiple evidences. Here a multimodal biometric system is proposed based on LBP, PCA and probabilistic neural network (PNN). In proposed method LBP extracted the Face features from face images and those features are given as input to PCA that generates Face Feature Vector with reduced Dimensions. Finger features are extracted from Fingerprint images using LBP and those features are given as input to PCA that generates Finger Feature Vector with reduced Dimensions. Using LBP, the distinct textual features of face and fingerprint are extracted. Weighted Summation Fusion method is used to combine these unimodal features. A probabilistic neural network is used as Classifier. An average recognition rate of 97.5% achieved with proposed method.

The leather surface images are rich in texture and results in large file sizes. Hence it needs high storage capacity and the computation time required to process these images is also huge. Image compression has become crucial in relation to processing, storage as well as for transmission. Lossy and lossless are the two compression techniques used widely and lossless compression is preferred for archival purposes. The aim is to present a very efficient image compression technique to reduce the computational complexity of the leather grading system and to store the leather images effectively. Our proposed methodology is to compress an image using second generation wavelets by introducing Lifting Scheme which provides the frame for building the Multiwavelet. The image is compressed by Set Partition in Hierarchical Tree (SPIHT) coding. According to the experimental results, the computational time for leather grading system is considerably reduced by compressing the image. The image is processed 42 % faster than the uncompressed image. © 2016 IEEE.",Leather images; Lifting Scheme; Lossless compression; Multiwavelet; SPIHT,Artificial intelligence; Grading; Image coding; Image processing; Leather; Compression techniques; Emerging technologies; Image compression techniques; Lifting schemes; Lossless compression; Multiwavelet; Second generation wavelet; SPIHT; Image compression,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Normalized Eigen values (i.e. the spectrum) of iris image can be stored in the Smartcard memory and then it may be used for further identification. Hence, for verifying if two iris images are isometric or not, we need to compare the first 'n' Eigen values of the iris image spectra. If two iris images have the same Eigen values or same Riemannian Metrics values, it means both iris images are belonging to the same person. If two iris images have different Eigen values or different Riemannian Metrics values, it means both iris images are belonging to different persons. The experiments were conducted for 50 iris images of CASIA database. The experiments prove that the proposed technique is accurately identifying individuals on the basis of their iris images. The robustness testing was conducted by modifying few pixels in specific regions and few pixels in overall image. But, still the proposed method was able to identify individuals on the basis of their iris image patterns. The results of iris implementation reveal that the proposed method is an efficient and economically feasible. © 2016 IEEE.",Eigen values; Iris Image; Laplace-Beltrami Operator; Noise Removal; Shape Matching,Image processing; Laplace transforms; Pixels; Smart cards; Eigen-value; Iris images; Laplace-Beltrami operator; Noise removal; Shape matching; Image compression,"Mishra, K.N.; Department of Computer Sc. and Engg., Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, (Alld.

These techniques however consume substantial processing time for the medical images. A new lossless encryption technique using quaternions can be adopted which reduces the processing time enormously. The quaternion technique is implemented using counter mode of encryption and modular arithmetic operations. The security of the medical image transmission can even be enhanced by incorporating digital watermarking which serves as an authentication of the sender and also reduces the difficulty in maintenance of multiple documents.

Among various plants, Banana is considered to be one of the most valuable plants. The scientific name of banana is Musa Paradisiacal. It has a life span of about 10-12 months. Banana leaf is to be regularly monitored for presence of disease. They are easily affected by viral disease called Banana Streak Virus. The symptom of the banana streak virus will be notice in the leaf of banana, by change in coloration into reddish yellow and this can be observed from fifth month of the plant. This leads to reduction in the growth of the plant as well as rottening of the banana fingers. The detection and prevention of banana streak viral disease is carried out using an Embedded Linux development board interfaced with a camera, which is used to capture the leaf of banana plant. The captured image is to be processed by an algorithm called Economic Threshold Level (ETL). This algorithm is used to set the threshold value of a healthy banana leaf of the captured image.

Image forgery detection is piled up by the necessity of authenticity and to preserve integrity of the images. And in majority of the cases copy-move image forgery technique is used to alter the digital image, in which a portion of the image is copied and pasted somewhere else in the same image with the purpose to cover an important image characteristic. Here, copy-move image forgery detection scheme is implemented to detect tampered digital images using adaptive overlapped segmentation and feature point matching. It integrates both block-based and keypoint-based forgery detection methods. Adaptive overlapped segmentation algorithm segments the image into different superpixels. Then, the feature points are extracted from each part using SURF algorithm, and these features are matched with one another, if the match exceeded the preset threshold it will indicate the suspected forgery regions and then merged regions are generated. Finally, detected forgery regions are displayed by applying the morphological operation to the merged regions. © 2016 IEEE.",Copy-move image forgery detection; Overlapped segmentation; Region extraction,Computer crime; Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Forensic engineering; Forensic science; Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Copy-move forgery detections; Feature point matching; Forgery detections; Image characteristics; Image forgery detections; Morphological operations; Region extraction; Segmentation algorithms; Image segmentation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In this paper, XOR ciphering technique used for encryption and decryption process. All existing mechanisms embed data by reversibly vacating room after the encrypted images. However, this may result in some errors on data extraction and/or image restoration. In this paper, we suggest a method by holding a space before encryption with a RDH algorithm.

Visual Perception is considered as the end product of visual system. It can be described as the way the brain interprets what the eye sees. Human Visual System can easily extract the structure information and structure character is widely used in perception-oriented image processing tasks, such as image retrieval, face detection, texture classification, and quality assessment. The existing structure descriptor describes about the intensity character and luminance contrast of a local region. By the orientation selectivity mechanism, the correlations among pixels in a local region based on the similarities of their preferred orientation are computed. On imitating the arrangement of the excitatory/inhibitory cells, the correlations between the central pixel and its neighbors i.e local neighbors got binarized, and the orientation selectivity based pattern is used. Then, taking both the gradient magnitude and the orientation selectivity based pattern into account, a rotation invariant structure descriptor is introduced. According to the Orientation selectivity mechanism on primary visual cortex,a novel structure descriptor is introduced which represents the spatial correlation of an image which is applied in texture classification and image quality assessment. With the novel structure descriptor, image structure was extracted,an orientation selectivity based structural histogram and recognition of an image was derived to represent the image content. © 2016 IEEE.",Correlations; Human Visual System; Luminance; Perception Oriented,Classification (of information); Face recognition; Image analysis; Image processing; Image quality; Image retrieval; Integrated circuits; Luminance; Pixels; Search engines; Vision; Correlations; Human Visual System; Image quality assessment; Orientation selectivity; Preferred orientations; Primary visual cortex; Structure information; Texture classification; Image texture,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The videos of six different types of flow patterns namely, annular flow, bubble flow, churn flow, plug flow, slug flow and stratified flow are recorded for a period and converted to 2D images for processing. The textural and shape features extracted using image processing are applied as inputs to various classification schemes namely fuzzy logic, SVM and SVM with PCA in order to identify the type of flow pattern.

The concept in such systems works towards development of the lane departure warning system based on video image processing techniques for Night light, Rainy weather, broken lane and normal road conditions. Due to the growing traffic and improper driving one may suffer from an accident. The proposed system will be helpful to determine the lane in which the car/bus etc should be driven.

Intervention between the protection of useful diagnostic information and noise suppression must be treasured in medical images. Image denoising is an applicable issue found in diverse image processing and computer vision problems. There are various existing methods to denoise images. The important property of a good image denoising model is that it should completely remove noise as far as possible as well as preserve edges. This paper presents a review of some major work in area of image denoising. The objective in all discipline is to extract information about the scene being imaged.

With the headway in image capturing devices, image data are being generated in high dimensions. However, processing the captured images plays a vital role that is gaining importance with its applicability in several filed of research. Numerous methods for processing of imagery have been developed nevertheless; existing methods still confines as the complexities of image increases with several coherent disadvantages such as greater amount of processing time and effort, prone to errors, inefficient outcome in terms of Accuracy Assessment parameters. Further, to classify the images into one of the several categories available in the database, typically make use of text associated with the image.

Identification of the diseases is the key to prevent qualitative and quantitative loss of agricultural yields. Rice (Oryza Sative) is one of the essential crops in India and losses due to the diseases badly impact the economy. Manual detection of the diseases is very difficult and not accurate. This creates a need for Image processing techniques which will help in accurate and timely detection of the diseases and overcome the limitations of the human vision. A new technique to diagnose and classify rice diseases has been proposed in this paper. Four diseases namely rice bacterial blight, rice blast, rice brown spot and rice sheath rot have been identified and classified. Different features like shape, the color of a diseased portion of the leaf have been extracted by developing an algorithm. All the extracted features have been combined as per the diseases and diseases have been classified using Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC) and k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (k-NN). The performance of the proposed technique has been evaluated with the help of 115 rice leaf images of four diseases and 70 percent image data has been used for training the classifier and 30 percent has been used for testing. Classification accuracy has been calculated for each disease using both classifiers.

This facilitates cardiologists to critically assess the cardiac function or dysfunction in a patient in terms of their left ventricle's performance, measured as its ejection fraction. Fuzzy c-means based pixel clustering is used for automatic segmentation. The left ventricle in all frames in the complete cardiac heartbeat cycle are extracted after being automatically loaded and segmented. In each image, pixels are grouped into two clusters-foreground and background. After the clustering, connected component analysis labels the pixels into connected regions. The left ventricle region is heuristically selected based on the distance from the image center and eccentricity. This novel original pixel clustering with labeling approach avoids manual initialization or user intervention. This method fully automatically extracts the left ventricle with more accuracy than manual tracing on all slices in the MRI images of the complete cardiac heartbeat cycle. The average computational processing speed per frame is 0.6 seconds, making it much more efficient than level sets, active contours, or other deformable methods, which need many iterations for the evolution of the snake or contour. Accuracy of the automated method presented herein was validated against manual tracing-based extraction. After performing the comparison on four MRI frames, it was found that an average correlation coefficient of 0.95 between the automatic and manual left ventricle segmented boundaries was higher than an average correlation coefficient of 0.85 between two manual tracing-based segmentations of the same. © 2016 IEEE.",,Biology; Extraction; Fuzzy systems; Heart; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Numerical methods; Pixels; Automatic segmentations; Average correlation coefficients; Computational processing; Connected component analysis; Connected component labeling; Ejection fraction; Fuzzy C means clustering; User intervention; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

This leads us towards Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, whose main objective is to detect an expressed emotion and recognize the same. The proposed work introduces an FER system, which models the relationship between human facial expression and corresponding induced emotion for static images by extracting shape and appearance features. Automatic interpretation of facial expressions from static images is very challenging, as information available in a static image is less when compared with image sequences. Proposed method incites efficient extraction of shape and appearance features from still images for varying facial expressions using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for classification. The proposed work is implemented on Cohn-kanade data set for six basic expressions (happy, sad, surprise, anger, fear and disgust). Results show that identification of human expressions from static images has a better detection rate when shape and appearance features are used rather than texture or geometric features. Use of HOG for feature extraction makes the FER system robust, and real time implementation is made much easier. © 2016 IEEE.",Facial Expression Recognition (FER); Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG); Support Vector Machine (SVM),Extraction; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Image processing; Image retrieval; Real time control; Support vector machines; Automatic recognition; Facial expression recognition; Facial Expressions; Geometric feature; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Human facial expressions; Products and services; Real-time implementations; Face recognition,,Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Key step towards tracking is detection. The next and main step is tracking, which is the process of finding the path of the object across the video sequence. Masking is the novel approach in video analysis. Masking is the process of discerning the region of moving object which is not to be revealed. Masking of particular object can be used in various applications like media conversation, Traffic monitoring, video conferencing. In the proposed system background subtraction algorithm is used for detecting moving objects in video, which is the most widely used approach.

Segmentation of iris from the eye and varied background illumination are the two main problems which decreases the Recognition Rate (RR). Segmentation is performed by extracting circular features of iris. Illumination is tackled by use of adaptive histogram. We propose two step feature optimization to improve the recognition rate. Firstly, we improve the sharpness of image by increasing the peak pixel values and decreasing the crest pixel values based on the thresholds found by experiments. Secondly, we enhance the feature vectors prior to feature selection. This is performed by matching the ranks of the pixel values in the feature vectors. Pixel values which are matching in their ranks are enhanced and others are penalized. Rank is computed based on pixel values. This improves the feature selection and also improves classification margin. Proposed techniques were applied on CASIA database. Top recognition rate was found to be 100% where as average recognition rate is found to be 98.66% showing the proposed algorithms work satisfactorily on the dataset applied. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature Optimization; Image Processing; Iris recognition; Machine Vision; Pixel Depth improvement; Rank match analysis,Biometrics; Computer vision; Image processing; Pixels; Adaptive histograms; Background illumination; Classification margins; Feature optimizations; Feature vectors; Iris recognition; Match analysis; Security fields; Feature extraction,"Charan, S.G.; Nokia IndiaIndia; email: charansg333@gmail.com",Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

An essential task for this framework is dictionary learning. Our novel proposition involves learning such a dictionary not only by analyzing the distribution of training data in the metric space but also exploiting local nature of the visual scene. Subsequently, the learning scheme is further developed for a message passing interface programming architecture. The resulting algorithm is applied to gray scale image denoising which one of the fundamental problems in image processing. In this regard, we show that dictionary learning from noisy images improves denoising performance.

We regard our research framework to that of a retrieval problem and adapt the so called codebook based Vector of Local Aggregate descriptor (VLAD) that has been promising for the object retrieval application in image processing. The codebook comprises a set of code vectors with associated Voronoi cells computed from a clustering algorithm on a set of feature vectors along the online trace. However, we show that the VLAD formulation at times, cannot effectively discriminate between writers, when their respective feature vectors are not linearly separable in the Voronoi cell of the code vectors. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel descriptor that improves upon the VLAD formulation. Secondly, we explore a normalization for the feature vectors prior to the generation of the VLAD. Our method is different to the min–max and z-score in that it takes care in ensuring that the codevectors are not influenced by the presence of outliers in the data. The performance of our proposed descriptor with the new feature normalization are evaluated on two publicly available Online Handwriting Databases – the IAM and IBM-UB1.

We propose symmetry features using gradient vector flow for Canny and Sobel edge images of each input frame to identify candidate edge components. Then for a candidate edge component image, we extract both global and local features using colors from different channels in a new way. Besides, the proposed method extracts statistical and structural features from the spatial distribution of candidate pixels in a multi-scale environment. Lastly, the extracted features are fed to a logistic classifier for categorization. The features extracted locally and globally are tested both separately and altogether in terms of confusion matrix. The performance of the proposed categorization method is evaluated through several text detection and recognition experiments before and after categorization.

The codebook is generated in two steps. 1. The training set is sorted based on the magnitudes of the training vectors. 2. From the sorted list, training vector from every nth position is selected to form the codevectors. Followed by that, centroid computation with clustering is done by repeated iterations to improve the optimality of the codebook. The codebook thus generated is compressed (lossy) to reduce the memory needed to store the codebook with the slight degradation in the quality of the reconstructed image. The bits needed to store the indices of the codevectors are further reduced to improve the compression rate without introducing any extra coding distortion (lossless) using the concept of Search Order Coding (SOC). The technique is tried with different codebooks of sizes 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 and the results are compared in terms of bits taken per pixel and PSNR (quality of the reconstructed image) values.

The characteristically similar nature of the melanocytic skin lesions specifically melanoma and dysplastic nevi make the diagnosis more subjective and time consuming, even for expert clinicians. Computer aided diagnostic system has a great impact on the notable discrimination of two closely similar classes of skin diseases by extracting a large number of effective features. In this reported work fractal geometry has been used for both skin lesion border irregularity measurement and texture features extraction. Here, in fractal based texture analysis technique the dermoscopic images have been decomposed into a set of binary images to extract more effective texture features from different grey regions of the image. From each of the image grey region, some statistical features have been extracted along with the fractal dimension measurement to quantify the intensity variation in that region. In this paper it has been established that the extraction of texture information from different small sub regions of the original image using fractal texture analysis increases the classification performance for both the classes. An analysis of the dependence of the performance of classifier using fractal based texture analysis, on the number of decomposed binary images, has been discussed.

Most of the image hashing algorithms has their limitations in getting the desirable performance against a particular image processing attack i.e. rotation. In this paper, we have proposed image hashing technique dominantly based on statistical features of the image which is robust to almost all kind of image processing attacks including rotation. In our proposed algorithm input image is normalized by using resizing, Gaussian filtering, color space conversion from RGB image to YCbCr and only Y component is taken for hash generation. Radon transform is then applied to the preprocessed image to produce 2-D Radon coefficients. 1-D DCT is then applied to the Radon coefficients to produce column-wise DCT coefficients. Lastly first AC coefficient from each column are taken to form the row-wise vector which is used to extract four statistical features, Mean, Standard Deviation, Kurtosis & Skewness. The extracted features form the final feature vector which is used for image identification. Many experiments have conducted to compare the proposed technique with the state-of-the-art techniques and the results shows that proposed hashing is robust to normal digital operations apart from giving excellent result against rotation. © 2016 IEEE.",Content based copy detection; Image forensics; Image hashing; Statistical Features,Feature extraction; Forensic engineering; Higher order statistics; Image retrieval; Radon; Statistical methods; Color space conversion; Content-based copy detections; Gaussian filtering; Image forensics; Image hashing; Image identification; State-of-the-art techniques; Statistical features; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

Hence, in this paper, compressive sensing (CS) and finite field wavelet packet-division multiplexing (FFWPDM) transmultiplexer based approach is proposed for secure transmission of multiple images. Further, to reconstruct the image, we utilize the compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm, namely orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) at the receiver.

CAD system performs diagnosis and detection of malignancy from suspect regions in medical image. Aggregation of cells (Nodules) is unusual appearances that are numerous, clustered, irregularly shaped and sized and branching in orientation. Detection sensitivity of cancer depends on identification of malignant nodules. Major challenge lies in the lesion ROI segmentation during the clinical evaluations. For clinical work flow medical images are stored in PACS. In this paper the nodules are extracted from the DICOM lung image in the noise environment such as Gaussian, salt and pepper, Poisson and speckle using different edge detection operators such as Gaussian, Average, Laplacian and Sobel. To increase the reliability, contour detection is followed by morphological analysis with various sizes of the Disk and Diamond structuring element and watershed algorithm. These results enable to analyze the accuracy of nodule extraction from DICOM images and the impact of the noise during Diagnosis. © 2016 IEEE.",DICOM; morphology; Nodules; Noise; structuring element; watershed,Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Edge detection; Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Morphology; Reliability analysis; Watersheds; X ray radiography; Detection sensitivity; DICOM; Edge-detection operators; Morphological analysis; Nodules; Noise; Structuring element; Water-shed algorithm; Computer aided diagnosis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

Based on the edge type and sharpness analysis using Laplacian operator, an effective representation of blur image detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which can determine that whether the image is blurred or not, and what is the extent of blur through Variance of Laplacian. In this project a simple, reliable and fast algorithm for image noise estimation is presented. Images taken for the testing is assumed to be corrupted by additive zero mean Gaussian noise. To exclude structures or details from contributive to the noise variance estimation, an easy edge detection algorithm inculcating first-order gradients is applied first. Then a Laplacian operator followed by an averaging over the whole image will provide very accurate noise variance estimation. There is only one parameter which is self-determined and adaptive to the image contents. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs well for different types of images over a large range of noise variances. Performance comparisons against alternative approaches are also provided. Results obtain through screenshots of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2016 IEEE.",Computer Vision; Laplacian Operator; Open-CV; Python,Computer vision; Digital devices; Edge detection; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Laplace equation; Mathematical operators; Spurious signal noise; Edge detection algorithms; Fast algorithms; Image quality assessment; Laplacian operator; Noise variance estimation; Open-CV; Performance comparison; Python; Laplace transforms,,Dwivedi R.K.Hamid A.B.A.Saxena A.K.Agarwal A.K.Ather D.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Regular monitoring of crops for early diagnosis and treatment with pesticides or removal of the affected crop is some of the solution to minimize the crop loss. Monitoring of the crops by human labour is costly, time consuming, error prone due to insufficient knowledge of the disease and highly repetitive at different stages of crop growth. These needs have motivated to design a line following mobile robot with vision sensors for navigation across the field for disease identification in a green house. The robot has been designed and simulated in an open source software known as Virtual Robot Experimental Platform (V-REP) with experimental field of 40 crops. Programming for navigation is done in Lua scripting tool which is embedded with the V-REP software. Capturing of images has been performed using camera. Processing of images for identification of disease and its representation in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been done using an algorithm in MATLAB R2011B which interacts with V-REP tool through socket communication.

It has found applications in various expanses like Games, Entertainment, Military, Navigation and many more. One such application could be in Library Management System. Earlier systems for book tracking involved immobile computers that only had the shelf numbers nested with book id to locate a book. A borrower needed to ask the Librarian/support staff to look up the shelf number from the system so as to find a book or simply do it manually by himself by searching each shelf. The application of Augmented Reality in Library Administration is useful in automating the proximity location tracking of a book and providing alternatives to the borrower in the books context. The borrower is navigated through the library till he/she reaches the shelf where the book is kept. The spine of the book serves as the index of the required book and contextual information is augmented once the book is located.

As the costs of dermatologists to monitor every patient is very high, there is a need for a computerized system to evaluate patient's risk of skin disease using images of their skin lesions. Many researchers have used different preprocessing, segmentation and classification techniques to determine whether a skin image suffers from diseases or not. Feature extraction is very important for predictive modeling applications. Feature extraction in image processing is a method of capturing visual content of images for indexing and retrieval. Primitive image features can be either general features, such as extraction of color, texture and shape or domain specific features. Texture based features are widely used in image analysis for medical diagnosis.

Block compressive sensing (BCS) of images has gained a prominence in recent years due to low encoding complexity. In this paper, we propose the reconstruction algorithm for BCS framework based on iterative re-weighted l1 norm minimization. In the proposed algorithm, the desired signal sparsity is achieved using l1 norm minimization while Wiener filtering is incorporated as the smoothing operator. We also propose block based joint reconstruction algorithm for correlated images and video frames. The correlation is captured through the joint sparsity model by minimizing the objective function which promotes the common sparsity structure.

Various methodologies for detection in forward-looking infrared imagery, which has higher spatial resolution, has been discussed by a number of researchers in literature. The algorithm we developed in the present study detects tanks not only in higher resolution but in lower resolution imagery as well. Detection algorithm is initiated by the segmentation of thermal image using mean shift, which provides possible targets present in the field other than the background. To reduce clutter and uneven illumination in a thermal image, a pre-processing morphological algorithm based on top-hat filtering has been implemented. After convolution of image window with Gabor filter banks, we extracted the energy feature of each image generated after convolution. The energy vector of such a target and the neighbouring background window has been calculated, and the similarity between the target and background using distance-measuring method has been measured. The minimum distance is used as the threshold to decide the target. A comparative study has been carried out between tanks and various targets/objects that appear similar to tanks in a thermal image. This validates our target detection algorithm. The false-positive rate and true-positive rate have been calculated for performance evaluation. Overall, this algorithm shows promising results for tank detection using single-band thermal imagery. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Airborne single-band thermal image; mean shift segmentation; morphological processing; top-hat filtering,Armored vehicles; Convolution; Feature extraction; Gabor filters; Image segmentation; Military vehicles; Signal detection; Tanks (containers); Forward-looking infrared imagery; Mean-shift segmentation; Morphological algorithms; Morphological processing; Target detection algorithm; Texture feature extraction; Thermal images; Top-hat filtering; Image processing,"Gautam, A.K.; Defense Terrain Research Laboratory, Defense Research and Development Organization, Metcalfe House, Civil Lines, India; email: shshgautam@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016730382

Many researchers have made an attempt to standardize and to propose a sign language recognition system. To the best our knowledge, according to the literature survey, most of the work reported has concentrated at the fingerspelling level or at the word level, and less work at the sentence level has been reported. As sign languages are very abstract, fingerspelling or word level interpretation of signs seems to be a tedious and cumbersome task. Although existing research in sign language recognition is active and extensive, it still remains a challenge to achieve accurate recognition and interpretation of signs at the sentence level. In this paper, we made an attempt to address this problem by proposing an approach that exploits the texture description technique and symbolic data analysis concept to characterize and effectively represent a sign, taking into account the intra-class variations due to different signers or the same signers at different instances of time. In order to study the efficacy of the proposed approach, extensive experiments were carried out on a considerably large database of Indian sign language created by us. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method has shown good recognition performance in terms of F-measure rates. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Indian sign language; local binary pattern variance (LBPV); symbolic data; video sequence,Image processing; Indian sign languages; Intra-class variation; Local binary patterns; Sign Language recognition; Symbolic data; Symbolic data analysis; Symbolic representation; Video sequences; Pattern recognition,"Chethana Kumara, B.M.; Department of Studies in Computer Science, University of MysoreIndia; email: chethanbm.research@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016824047

LWT is faster and efficient implementation of traditional wavelet transform and LSVR has faster learning speed and high generalization capability compared to classical support vector regression. Combination of LWT and LSVR based image watermarking not only show imperceptibility and robustness but also reduces the time complexity. First the image is decomposed into four subbands using one level LWT and low frequency subband (approximate image) is partitioned into non overlapping blocks. Selected blocks based on correlation of wavelet coefficients are used to embed the binary watermark logo. For each selected block, significant wavelet coefficient is used as target to LSVR and its neighboring coefficients (feature vector) act as input to LSVR. The security of the watermark is achieved by applying Arnold transformation to original watermark. The scrambled watermark bit is embedded by comparing the output (predicted value) of LSVR of each selected block and the actual target value. The good learning capability and high generalization property of LSVR against noisy datasets provides the successful extraction of watermark against several image processing attacks: median filtering, average filtering, addition of Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, contrast enhancement, blurring, scaling, cropping and rotation. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme gives significant improvement in imperceptibility and robustness compared to the state-of-art techniques. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bit error rate; Digital watermarking; Lagrangian support vector regression; Lifting wavelet transform; Peak signal-to-noise ratio; Support vector regression,Bit error rate; Digital watermarking; Economic and social effects; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image coding; Image processing; Image watermarking; Lagrange multipliers; Median filters; Regression analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Vectors; Efficient implementation; Generalization capability; Generalization properties; Learning capabilities; Lifting wavelet transforms; Peak signal to noise ratio; Salt-and-pepper noise; Support vector regression (SVR); Wavelet transforms,"Mehta, R.; University School of Information and Communication Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Sector 16-C, India; email: rajesh2010usit@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,18688071,,,,English,Intl.

This paper proposes an essential threshold based progressive secret image sharing scheme. Affine Boolean functions are used to generate 2i noise-like shares in ‘i’ levels, out of which at least ‘s’ (2i?1) shares are considered as essential and the rest are non-essential shares. Essential shares suffice to reconstruct/decode the secret image with a certain level of recognizability. The contribution of the non-essential part progressively aids on the quality of the reconstructed image. Robustness in term of decoding reliability of the proposed method is also studied against a set of common operations including random gain change on the share images.

Medical images acquired from different modalities give rise to a practical problem in image registration. For many years, mutual information has been utilized as a similarity criterion for registration. Therefore, it is believed to be the state-of-the-art in this field. Nonetheless, it is understood to be non-convex and possess many local maxima. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel evolutionary rigid body docking (ERBD) algorithm for medical image registration. Here, the ligand is taken as the non-aligned (target) image (to be registered) and protein as the reference image. The alignment of the target image is changed as per the optimal configuration. This paper introduces a firsthand objective (fitness) function for finding optimal configurations. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the fitness function. The proposed method is useful for recovery of rotation and translation parameters. Different image data formats like magnetic resonance image (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) images from Retrospective Image Registration Evaluation (RIRE) project are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The identification of exact location of stroke lesion helps in perceiving its characteristics, an essential part of diagnosis and treatment planning. This task is challenging due to the typical shape of the stroke lesion. This paper proposes an efficient method for computer-aided delineation of stroke lesions from DWI images. Method: Proposed methodology comprises of three steps. At the initial step, image contrast has been improved by applying fuzzy intensifier leading to the better visual quality of the stroke lesion. In the following step, a two-class (stroke lesion area vs. non-stroke lesion area) segmentation technique based on Gaussian mixture model has been designed for the localization of stroke lesion. To eliminate the artifacts which would appear during segmentation process, a binary morphological post-processing through area operator has been defined for exact delineation of the lesion area. Result: The performance of the proposed methodology has been compared with the manually delineated images (ground truth) obtained from different experts, individually.

For visual object tracking, the MIL framework is used to select a few discriminative features from a pool of features by maximizing the bag likelihood. The feature pool consists of computationally efficient Haar-like features. Each feature is used for the construction of weak classifier also called decision stump. A few classifiers with high discriminative power (to separate target from background) are combined to form a strong classifier. The key point is the selection of a few highly discriminative features from a very large pool in small amount of time to ensure fast and accurate tracking. In this paper, we propose a fast online feature selection algorithm based on maximizing the classifier score (CSR). The tracking performance is better than the existing feature selection methods. This paper also introduces kernel trick on Haar-like features for target tracking. Furthermore, we explore use of Haar-features in half target space. To get the actual target size in successive video frames, a scaling strategy is applied. By having the feature matching using kernel, Haar-features in half target spaces and scale adaptation method in a single tracking framework, we obtain better tracking performance as compared to the state-of-the-art trackers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Classifier score; Computer vision; Haar-features; Kernels; Multiple instance learning; Visual tracking; Weak classifier,Computer vision; Image processing; Lakes; Learning systems; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Haar features; Kernels; Multiple instance learning; Visual Tracking; Weak classifiers; Feature extraction,"Sharma, V.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: vijay4247@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,9235965,,SPICE,,English,Signal Process Image Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011072050

The blurring in case of an up-sampled image is caused by the degradation of HF and VHF image details that correspond to fine details and edge regions during the up-sampling process. The degradation of HF and VHF image details is more significant than that of the flat and slowly varying regions. In order to resolve this problem effectively, a fuzzy composite scheme is developed which is based on the inverse modeling approach of HF degradation. During the pre-processing operation, the VHF components of an image are boosted up using recursive Laplacian of Laplacian (LOL) operator prior to image up-scaling. Subsequent to the image up-scaling, a fuzzy local adaptive Laplacian post-processing scheme is used which enhances the HF image details more than the low frequency image details based on local statistics in the up-scaled image. The HF restoration performance of the fuzzy based composite scheme is enhanced by improving its nonlinearity through the variations of different parameters of the fuzzy inference system (FIS) such as slope, width and the number of input-, and output membership functions. The effective fusion of pre-processing and post-processing operations makes the proposed scheme much effective to tackle the non-uniform blurring than the standalone pre-processing and post-processing techniques.

Detection of edges for an image may help for image segmentation, data compression, and image reconstruction. Edges of an image are considered a type of crucial information that can be extracted by applying detectors with different methodologies. Its main purpose is to simplify the image data in order to minimize the amount of data to be processed. There exist many rich classical edge detection techniques which make use of integer-order differentiation operators and can function in both spatial and frequency domains. In the case of integer-order differentiation operators, the gradient operator is identified by order ‘one’ and the Laplacian by order ‘two.’ This paper demonstrates a new kind of edge detector based on the ‘fractional’ (‘non-integer’)-order differentiation operation and through the usage of the ‘fractional Fourier transformation’ tool, so as to perform it in the fractional Fourier frequency domain, known as the edge detection based on fractional signal processing approach. It is shown through computer simulations that this approach can detect the edges precisely and efficiently. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated from the quantitative aspects of mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio through simulations. The experiments show that, for any grayscale image, this method can obtain better edge detection performance to satisfy human visual sense. Moreover, comparisons are also provided to prove that the proposed method outperforms the classical edge detection operators, interpreted in terms of robustness to noise. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Edge detection; Fractional differential mask; Fractional Fourier frequency domain filtering; Fractional Fourier transform; Fractional-order calculus; Grünwald–Letnikov fractional derivative,Calculations; Differentiation (calculus); Edge detection; Fourier optics; Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Image compression; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Mean square error; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Fractional derivatives; Fractional differential; Fractional Fourier transforms; Fractional-order calculus; Frequency-domain filtering; Signal detection,"Kumar, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: sanjay.kumar@thapar.edu",,Birkhauser Boston,0278081X,,CSSPE,,English,Circ Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013997820

The manual assessment of pathology slides is time-consuming and complicated regarding various types of cell identification. This paper proposes an ensemble rule-based decision-making approach for morphological classification of erythrocytes. Firstly, the digital microscopic blood smear images are pre-processed for removal of spurious regions followed by colour normalisation and thresholding. The erythrocytes are segmented from background image using the watershed algorithm. The shape features are then extracted from the segmented image to detect shape abnormality present in microscopic blood smear images. The decision about the abnormality is taken using proposed multiple rule-based expert systems. The deciding factor is majority ensemble voting for abnormally shaped erythrocytes. Here, shape-based features are considered for nine different types of abnormal erythrocytes including normal erythrocytes. Further, the adaptive boosting algorithm is used to generate multiple decision tree models where each model tree generates an individual rule set. The supervised classification method is followed to generate rules using a C4.5 decision tree. The proposed ensemble approach is precise in detecting eight types of abnormal erythrocytes with an overall accuracy of 97.81% and weighted sensitivity of 97.33%, weighted specificity of 99.7%, and weighted precision of 98%. This approach shows the robustness of proposed strategy for erythrocytes classification into abnormal and normal class.

By analysis of photons scattering process by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) the inhomogeneities in tissues are to be identified and their images reconstructed. Methods Digital phantoms with goat's heart as a control tissue embedded with inhomogeneities adipose (high scattering) and spleen (high absorption) are simulated. The phantoms considered are – (a) simulation of the developed stage of inhomogeneity by inclusion of adipose and spleen tissues in control and (b) its onset stage by increasing the optical parameters by 10% at fixed locations in control tissue. These phantoms are scanned by simulated system, consisting of nine ports for photon injection and backscattered photons from each port are received by three ports located at 2, 4 and 6 mm from the injecting port, placed in the direction of x-axis. By the data collected from the entire surface, by processing, three grey-scale images are constructed. For localization of inhomogeneities these images are scanned in terms of normalized backscattered intensity (NBI). Results The images obtained by MCS with 1 million photons, with error minimized, at respective ports, show the presence of inhomogeneities at various depths, which is further supported by the increase or decrease in the NBI compared to that of control for adipose or spleen, respectively. The increase or decrease is more at first port compared to others. The inhomogeneities located at 2 mm below the surface are better identified by the receiving port located at 2 mm on the surface. The same applies to inhomogeneities located at 4 and 6 mm, respectively. Conclusion The present simulated system not only shows the presence of inhomogeneties at various depths in tissue phantom but also presents their characteristics. © 2017",Inhomogeneities; Monte Carlo simulation; Normalized backscattered intensity; Reflectance imaging system; Tissues phantoms,"Backscattering; Bioinformatics; Histology; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Phantoms; Photons; Backscattered intensity; Backscattered photons; Inhomogeneities; Laser backscattering; Monte carlo simulations (MCS); Optical characteristics; Reflectance imaging; Scattering process; Tissue; adipose tissue; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; image reconstruction; imaging phantom; imaging system; laser; light scattering; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; photon; tissue section; tumor localization; animal; goat; imaging phantom; laser; Monte Carlo method; neoplasm; pathology; Animals; Goats; Lasers; Monte Carlo Method; Neoplasms; Phantoms, Imaging","Singh, M.; Department of Sensor and Biomedical Technology, School of Electronics Engineering, V.I.T.

The cover image is encrypted; the information to be secured is scrambled, and then embedded in the Intermediate Significant Bit (ISB) planes of encrypted cover image, at the locations determined by a Pseudorandom Address Vector (PAV). The pseudorandom embedding of the scrambled data in the ISB planes of encrypted image results in a three tier security of the data to be secured. The ISBPE embedding results in an important advantage that the proposed scheme becomes completely robust to commonly employed attack of Least Significant Bit (LSB) removal/replacement. A novel concept of embedding a very small size fragile watermark in addition to the secret information has been used which facilitates early tamper detection. This feature could save crucial processor time in critical situations of national security issues/warfare etc. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more robust to various signal processing attacks like Joint Picture Expert Group compression, Additive White Gaussian Noise and ‘salt and pepper’ noise as compared to conventional LSB based embedding techniques. Comparison results with some well-known techniques show that besides providing high degree of security and robustness to various malicious attacks the proposed technique is capable of embedding a fairly large amount of secret data in the host image while maintaining a good stego-image quality. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Data hiding; Intermediate significant bit plane; Scrambling; Tamper detection; Watermarking,Cryptography; Digital watermarking; Gaussian noise (electronic); National security; Network security; Security of data; Signal processing; Steganography; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Data hiding; Embedding technique; Joint picture expert groups; Least significant bits; Scrambling; Significant bit planes; Tamper detection; Image processing,"Parah, S.A.; Post Graduate Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Technology, University of KashmirIndia; email: shabireltr@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9236082,,MUSPE,,English,Multidimens Syst Signal Proc,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941350064

Hence it has become one of the major research areas. Conventional image segmentation techniques are unable to provide satisfactory segmentation results for medical images as they contain irregularities. They need to be pre-processed before segmentation. In order to obtain the most suitable method for medical image segmentation, we propose MIST (Medical Image Segmentation Tool), a two stage algorithm. The first stage automatically generates a binary marker image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology. This marker serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses GrabCut to yield an efficient segmented result. The obtained result can be further refined by user interaction, which can be done using the proposed Graphical User Interface (GUI). Experimental results show that the proposed method is accurate and provides satisfactory segmentation results with minimum user interaction on medical as well as natural images. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Interactive; Medical image; Morphology; MRI; Segmentation; X-ray,"Binary images; Graphical user interfaces; Iterative methods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical morphology; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Morphology; User interfaces; X rays; Clinical evaluation; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Interactive; Iterative refinement; Region of interest; Segmentation results; Segmentation techniques; Two-stage algorithm; Image segmentation; algorithm; Article; automation; computer interface; diagnostic imaging; image processing; image reconstruction; image segmentation; imaging software; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; mathematical morphology; measurement accuracy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; robotics; x-ray computed tomography; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer interface; human; machine learning; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; system analysis; Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Systems Integration; User-Computer Interface","Chattopadhyay, C.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology JodhpurIndia; email: chiranjoy@iitj.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,28214717,English,Comput.

The primary goal of medical image fusion is to combine several images obtained from various sources into a distinct image suitable for improved diagnosis. Complexity in medical images is higher, and many soft computing methods are applied by researchers to process them. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are more appropriate for medical images because the images have many uncertainties. In this paper, a new method, based on Sugeno's intuitionistic fuzzy set (SIFS), is proposed. First, medical images are converted into Sugeno's intuitionistic fuzzy image (SIFI). An exponential intuitionistic fuzzy entropy calculates the optimum values of membership, non-membership, and hesitation degree functions. Then, the two SIFIs are disintegrated into image blocks for calculating the count of blackness and whiteness of the blocks. Finally, the fused image is rebuilt from the recombination of SIFI image blocks. The efficiency of the use of SIFS in multimodal medical image fusion is demonstrated on several pairs of images and the results are compared with existing studies in recent literature. © 2017 ETRI.",Diagnosis; Image fusion; SIFI; SIFS; Uncertainties,Diagnosis; Fuzzy sets; Image processing; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Soft computing; Stress intensity factors; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Intuitionistic fuzzy entropies; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Multimodal medical images; SIFI; SIFS; Soft computing methods; Uncertainties; Image fusion,"Tirupal, T.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological UniversityIndia; email: tirutalari@gmail.com",,ETRI,12256463,,ETJOF,,English,ETRI J.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016475265

It aims at improving the visual and informational quality of the distorted images. Histogram equalization is one of the most frequently used techniques for image contrast enhancement. However, histogram and most of the other enhancement approaches may yield un-natural looking or artifacts after enhancement, and the images computed by these methods are not desirable in few applications such as consumer electronic products where brightness preservation is necessary to avoid annoying artifacts. To overcome such problems, a new optimal grey level mapping based edge preserved satellite images enhancement technique using a beta differential evolution (BDE) algorithm has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method uses a simple grey-level mapping technique and beta differential evolution algorithm together with corresponding enhancement operators for quality contrast and brightness boosting of the satellite images. In this approach, the grey levels of the input image are replaced by a new set of grey levels. The proposed algorithm has been tested on numerous colored satellite images and also on standard Lena image.

Despite the fact, segmentation of retinal vessels still remains a challenging task due to the presence of abnormalities, varying size and shape of the vessels, non-uniform illumination and anatomical variability between subjects. In this paper, we carry out a systematic review of the most recent advancements in retinal vessel segmentation methods published in last five years. The objectives of this study are as follows: first, we discuss the most crucial preprocessing steps that are involved in accurate segmentation of vessels. Second, we review most recent state-of-the-art retinal vessel segmentation techniques which are classified into different categories based on their main principle. Third, we quantitatively analyse these methods in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve and discuss newly introduced performance metrics in current literature.

The target is image sequences taken by a moving camera in this paper. Tracking methods using color information tend to track mistakenly a background region or an object with color similar to the target object since the proposed method is based on the particle filter. The method constructs the probabilistic background model by the histogram of the optical flow and defines the likelihood function so that the likelihood in the region of the target object may become large. This leads to increasing the accuracy of tracking. The probabilistic background model is made by the density forests. It can infer a probabilistic density fast. The proposed method can process faster than the authors' previous approach by introducing the density forests. Results are demonstrated by experiments using the real videos of outdoor scenes.

Structure from Motion (SfM) is well known computer vision technique for estimating 3D structure from 2D image sequences. Inherent complexities of the SfM pose different algorithmic and implementation challenges to have an efficient enablement on embedded processor for real time processing. This paper focuses on highlighting such challenges and innovative solutions for them. The paper proposes an efficient SfM solution that has been implemented on Texas Instrument's TDA3x series of System on Chip (SoC). The TDA3x SoC contains one vector processor (known as Eve) and two C66x DSPs as co-processors which are useful for computationally intensive vision processing. The proposed SfM solution which performs Sparse Optical Flow, Fundamental matrix estimation, Triangulation, 3D points pruning consumes 42% of Eve and 10% of one DSP for 25 fps processing of one mega pixel image resolution. © 2017 IEEE.",,Automobile drivers; Image processing; Image resolution; Parallel processing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Semiconductor device manufacture; Stereo vision; System-on-chip; Computer vision techniques; Driver assistance system; Fundamental matrix estimation; Inherent complexity; Innovative solutions; Realtime processing; Structure from motion; System on chips (SoC); Advanced driver assistance systems,,Sanchez D.D.Lee J.-H.Pescador F.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a noninvasive, repeatable, and atomical tool for medical imaging in clinic system, was widely used in affective computing; however, it faces its dataset processing difficulty for dimensional reduction as well as for decreasing the computational complexity. In addition, features extraction from those de-dimensionality datasets is a challenging issue. The current work solved the de-dimensionality issue by using some preprocessing algorithms including clustering, morphological segmenting, and locality preserving projection. In order to keep useful information in fMRI dataset for reduction process, improved neighborhood pixel-based locality preserving projection (NP-LPP) algorithm was addressed and continuously for feature extraction operating using Otsu weighted sum of histogram. Furthermore, a modified covariance power spectral density (MC-PSD) separately in an fMRI Valence–Arousal experiments was measured. The results were analyzed and compared with affective norms English words system. The experiments established that the proposed methods of NP-LPP effectively simplified high complexity of fMRI, and Otsu weighted sum of histogram exhibited superior performance for features extraction compared to the MC-PSD through the calculation root mean standard error.

Facial feature extraction is very much important for the initialization of processing techniques like face tracking, facial expression recognition or face recognition. Among all facial features, eye localization and detection is essential, from which locations of all other facial features are identified. However, the existing face recognition techniques failed to identify the exact person. In order to overcome this issue, Geometric Shaped Facial Feature Extraction for Face Recognition (GSF2EFR) is designed for identifying the exact person by finding the center and corners of the eye using eye detection and eye localization modules. An input facial image is given where the face map gets initialized and processed in the form of coarse-to-fine manner with two modules. In the first module, eye detector is used to detect the eye pattern using Gabor filter. In the second module, the location of eye center is found using SVM classifier to reduce the eye localization time. Finally, after locating the center and corners of eye fiducial points are found from which the face of an individual gets recognized. The better performance of proposed GSF2EFR system is measured in terms of eye detection accuracy, eye localization time and true positive rate. © 2016 IEEE.",eye detector; Eye localization; facial expression recognition; Facial feature extraction; Gabor filter; SVM classifier,Edge detection; Extraction; Eye protection; Feature extraction; Gabor filters; Human computer interaction; Image processing; Location; Object recognition; Eye localization; Face recognition technique; Facial expression recognition; Facial feature extraction; Human face image; Processing technique; SVM classifiers; True positive rates; Face recognition,,Satheesh Kumar J.Devi T.Rajeswari R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Detection is done by continuously looking out for symptoms of drowsiness, while considering both physiological and physical signs. Physiological factors include core body temperature and pulse rate. Both of these parameters will decrease during the onset of drowsiness. These are monitored by using somatic sensors. Physical cues including yawning, drooping eyelids, closed eyes and increased blink durations. Once the system detects that the driver is drowsy by using a combination of these factors, it alerts the driver across multiple stages depending on the severity of the symptoms.

The success of this primary module determines the accuracy rate of higher level of image processing task. This module is application specific in nature. So determining a suitable image enhancement for real time images is a challenging one. Common distortions that are found in the real time images are contrast variation, blur, salt and pepper noise and so on. It is a challenging task to enhance the low level of blur distortion in an image. Hence in this paper the existing image smoothing methods (mean filter, Gaussian filter, anisotropic diffusion, median filter, adaptive median filter, conservative smoothing, and alpha trim mean filter) suitable to enhance low level distortion in images are evaluated in detail. Images of low distortions along with its ground truth image were taken from the CSIQ dataset. Performance of the existing image smoothing methods was measured using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). Results showed that PSNR and SSIM were higher for conservative smoothing method followed by the adaptive median filtering method. Hence, this study concludes that conservative smoothing technique and adaptive median smoothing among neighborhood processing techniques could be deployed as a suitable image enhancement algorithm for blur effect removal. © 2016 IEEE.",Image enhancement; Image smoothing; Quantitative analysis,Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Chemical analysis; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Median filters; Signal to noise ratio; Adaptive median filter; Adaptive median filtering; Anisotropic Diffusion; Image enhancement algorithm; Image smoothing; Image smoothing method; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity index measures (SSIM); Image processing,,Satheesh Kumar J.Devi T.Rajeswari R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Once a thyroid nodule has been detected (or suspected), the first test that is routinely being performed is the fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (invasive). This test result is helpful in the classification of the nodule being benign or malignant with the aid of bio-markers. Another common test is the Ultrasound imaging (non-invasive). But, due to the inherent spatial limitations within the Ultrasound image, distinguishing the different pathological conditions related to Thyroiditis are challenging. The aim of this study is to classify multiple pathological conditions related to Thyroiditis by analyzing various textural image features extracted from ultrasound images. The thyroid Ultrasound images are retrospectively collected (with biopsy results) from a private scan center in Chennai, India. The image database contains thirty five Adenoma conditions, sixteen Hashimoto's conditions and twenty five normal cases. The abnormal conditions on the Ultrasound images are drawn manually by the experienced radiologist and stored as a 'ground truth'. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix and the gray-level run-length features of the 'hand drawn' region of interest (ROI) are extracted for each image. The features are then analyzed using the statistical unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test and classified based on the 'ground truth' data. The t-test shows a significant (p<0.001) differences between the groups. The texture features extracted from the Ultrasound images proves that the thyroid disorders such as Adenoma and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis can be distinguished from the normal using the highlighted texture features. © 2016 IEEE.",Adenoma; FNAC; Hashimoto's; Texture Features; Thyroiditis,Biopsy; Image segmentation; Testing; Tumors; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic imaging; Adenoma; FNAC; Hashimoto's; Texture features; Thyroiditis; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Considering the limitations with existing aids for mobility of visually impaired, we propose a new device to help visually impaired in their outdoor mobility. This device uses an RGB camera and image processing techniques to recognize the surrounding objects and inform/alarm the user accordingly.

In order to make their storage and transfer efficient, different data compression techniques are used in the literature. The ultimate motive behind data compression is to transform a big size data into small size data, which eventually implies less space while archiving, and less time in transferring. However, in order to operate/analyze compressed data, it is usually necessary to decompress it, so as to bring back the data to its original form, which unfortunately warrants an additional computing cost. In this backdrop, if operating upon the compressed data itself can be made possible without going through the stage of decompression, then the advantage that could be accomplished due to compression would escalate. Further due to compression, from the data structure and storage perspectives, the original visibility structure of the data also being lost, it turns into a potential challenge to trace the original information in the compressed representation. This challenge is the motivation behind exploring the idea of direct processing on the compressed data itself in the literature. The proposed survey paper specifically focuses on compressed document images and brings out two original contributions. The first contribution is that it presents a critical study on different image analysis and image compression techniques, and highlights the motivational reasons for pursuing document image analysis in the compressed domain. The second contribution is that it summarizes the different compressed domain techniques in the literature so far based on the type of compression and operations performed by them. Overall, the paper aims to provide a perspective for pursuing further research in the area of document image analysis and pattern recognition directly based on the compressed data. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",Compressed data analysis; Compressed document; Compressed domain; Compressed image processing,Big data; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Government data processing; Image analysis; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Compressed datum; Compressed document; Compressed domain; Compressed images; Compressed-domain techniques; Data compression techniques; Image compression techniques; Internet based application; Image compression,"Javed, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, (An Autonomous Institute Under VTU, Belagavi), NMAM Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: javedsolutions@gmail.com",,Springer Netherlands,2692821,,AIRVE,,English,Artif Intell Rev,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015724203

To this aim, a scheme to construct a four cycle free non-binary (NB) LDPC code is proposed first. The NB-LDPC code is designed using the base matrix of the LDPC code present in IEEE 802.16 standard. The proposed NB-LDPC code matrices are quasi-cyclic in nature with a large girth and an irregular structure. The code matrices are so designed that they can act as the sensing matrix for CS applications and also provide a means of protection from channel errors. This study shows that the proposed LDPC codes can act as CS sensing matrices and also offer a low bit error rate performance as compared to the existing codes. A large set of simulation results report the improved CS image reconstruction performance as variation in measurement sizes and rate of the NB-LDPC codes.

The TRBG uses two mutually coupled double scroll chaotic systems that are synchronized via complete chaotic synchronization and inverse ?-lag synchronization techniques. The numerical simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of chaotic true random bits generator through FIPS-140-2 randomness test suite. The proposed generator is applied with an aim to secure the digital images by framing an image encryption process based on the effective TRBG. The statistical analyses conform to the required encryption standards and quality. But, Volos et al image encryption scheme inherently holds a number of vulnerabilities that make it possible to break the encryption scheme. This paper proposes the break of the Volos et al image encryption scheme by exploiting these vulnerabilities to evidence that their scheme lacks security. It is practically shown by applying the chosen-plaintext and known-plaintext attacks which successfully recovers the plaintext-image from the encrypted image without knowing the secret key.

For detecting image forgery there is a need to have important features of the image. For obtaining the image features we need a suitable transform. One of the important and commonly used transform is discrete wavelet transform that can provide spatial and frequency related information of a signal. However, it provides ambiguous information due to its shift variant property. This ambiguity can be overcome using the UWT due to its shift invariance property. In forgery, some operations are applied to an image at different locations. For instance same type of details at different locations, the UWT provides the output of same nature, whereas the DWT doesn't. Due to this property, the features extracted in undecimated wavelet transform (UWT) domain provide better results in many applications like denoising, change detection, etc. In this paper, image features are extracted using the Markov model after transforming it into UWT domain. To evaluate the performance CASIA v1.0, Columbia Color and DSO-1 databases are used. The support vector machine with the linear kernel applied to separate the forged and pristine images. We experimentally obtain better results using the UWT transform as compared to the DWT transform on all these three databases. © 2016 IEEE.",Image forgery; Markov process; Splicing; Tampering,Cable jointing; Discrete wavelet transforms; Feature extraction; Image processing; Markov processes; Change detection; High quality images; Image forgery; Image forgery detections; Important features; Shift-invariance properties; Tampering; Undecimated wavelet transform; Wavelet transforms,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Accurate and automatic detection of macula from fundus images is an essential step to develop automated screening tool for ocular pathologies. The proposed work presents an imaging method for detection of macula in fundus images automatically. The proposed method includes a strategic windowing based approach for accurate detection of macula. Instead of searching macula from whole fundus image, a search region is considered with the help of optic disc and then macula is detected from that search region using double windowing based method. Normal and affected fundus images from a local eye hospital were used to test the performance of proposed method and achieved encouraging results.

Various techniques have been developed to extract either Text, Table or Figure region in a document image. However, our finding from past research suggests that these techniques do not deal with documents containing a combination of two or more such regions. Moreover, we believe that in order to facilitate document recreation, the extracted information requires organization in terms of its semantic layout and formatting. Therefore, we advocate the need of a combined technique for extracting each of these regions and need of structuring the extracted information efficiently. In this paper, we propose an efficient two-stage framework CDIA-DS (Compound Document Image Analysis-Data Structure) to cater the aforementioned needs. In the first stage, the regions in document image are identified, and classified in the form of Views (Text/Table/Figure). Views are then organized in the second stage through the proposed tree based structure comprising of leaf and parent nodes in the form of Views and Layouts (arrangement of one or more Views) respectively. In the end experiments are done, to examine the efficiency of CDIA-DS using the proposed data structure. © 2016 IEEE.",,Data structures; Semantics; Technology transfer; Combined techniques; Compound document images; Document images; Efficient reconstruction; Electronic formats; Parent node; Tree-based structures; Image processing,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

On the same time, World Health Organization (WHO) is a dedicated health organization from United Nations quotes, 'By 2030 diabetes will be one of the seventh leading causes of death, whereas, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be about 9% among adults aged above 18 (measured in 2014)'. Though, diabetes is not completely curable but early stage detection can helps in controlling the degree of severity of this silent killer. One of the controlling factors, which could help in early detection, is the retina of the eye, a light sensitive metabolically active region on which noninvasive observation can possible. As eye is a metabolically active organ, it gets affected at the earliest stage for the people suffering from Diabetes. Thereafter, analyzing the symptoms of retina, like, miroaneurysms, exudates, and edemas can predict the degree of severity. Since, a plan is required towards the studying these symptoms on digital image, the fundus image of the retina, and the detection of attributes, like, miroaneurysms, exudates and edemas. Before carrying out the analysis, it is very essential to properly locate the optic disc and macula which are geometrically important for the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy on digital images.

It eventually damages the the costly machinery or important documents. So, a system based on image processing based fire detection technique and then a mechanical system to fastidiously smother it. Its biggest benefit is that it will be possible to detect the fire at comparatively early stage and extinguish it selectively so that the other unaffected areas of the room won't be damaged. This system is divided into three stages. First of all, fire is detected using image processing. Secondly, exact co-ordinates of the location of fire are determined. Then, an electro-mechanical system is built to fastidiously smother the fire without damaging other property.

This has set a huge measure of burden on governments and medical service authorities. As of now, researchers have identified that DM can be recognized in a non-invasive approach through the analysis of human facial blocks. In this paper, a novel way has been proposed to detect DM using texture and color features of facial blocks. For DM detection, four facial blocks have been selected which characterize facial image, color and texture features have been extracted from these blocks using color space transformation and 2-D Gabor Filter (GF) respectively. Input RGB image is transformed into Lab color space to extract color features. Extracted texture and color features represent the samples, where each facial block is defined by a single texture and color value. Healthy verses DM samples have been classified with accuracy 94.28% using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and 97.14% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. © 2016 IEEE.",Color Features; Diabetes Mellitus; Gabor Filter; K-NN; SVM; Texture Features,Automation; Color; Feature extraction; Gabor filters; Image enhancement; Image processing; Nearest neighbor search; Process control; Support vector machines; Color and texture features; Color features; Color space transformation; Diabetes mellitus; Infectious disease; K-nearest neighbors; Medical services; Texture features; Color image processing,"Padawale, S.N.; Department of Electronics and Telecommunication, Rajarshi Shahu College of EngineeringIndia; email: swapnali.np@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The extracted lip contour can be useful in tracking the lip movements in Visual Speech Recognition. The accuracy of the system can be improved by correct extraction of the lip contours. In this paper, a computer vision approach is proposed to automatically extract lip contour from the face image. The proposed technique uses Viola Jones algorithm to localize the face and mouth in the image. Unlike existing methods merge thresholds used in Viola Jones are made iterative and adaptive which makes it invariant to the quality of input image. The colour space conversion and clustering method results in separation of lip from non lip pixels which are further subjected to morphological operations and ellipse fitting for an efficient lip contour extraction. The proposed method has been tested on 4000 images from the VidTimit database and results showed significant improvement in lip segmentation than some of the existing methods for lip contour extraction.

It is an alarming issue and is one of the major causes to prolong human wounds. Wounds examination process involves an expertise and constant follow ups to check and recommend wound details. This is a costly process and troublesome in case of bed ridden patients. Various systems like MEdical Digital PHOtogrammetric System (MEDPHOS), Measurement of Area and Volume Instrument System (MAVIS) have been developed for wound assessment. The systems suffer from high cost and maintenance. Moreover, these also need an expertise to perform assessment. As smart phones have become the part and parcel of our lives, this project attempts to make use of Smart phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analyzing images of chronic foot ulcers. In this paper, we have developed an android based smartphone based solution involving the patients or hospital nurses actively. Additionally, we have also developed an online 'Experts review' system which would send the image analysis notifications to the user. The proposed system consist of an android-based PC application. The user captures the image and uploads the image to the database. The image is then processed against the K-shift algorithm. The inferences like the wound status are then sent to the user and the image is also sent for expert review. The experts then examine the image, and based on the status of the wounds, they suggest for any changes in the treatment. Our simulation results show that the wound detection using K-mean shift algorithms gave good accuracy of approximately 80%. This shows that with this smart phone system provides promising accuracy for wound image analysis. © 2016 IEEE.",Android based smartphone; Diabetes; Image processing; Mean shift,Android (operating system); Automation; Image analysis; Medical problems; mHealth; Optimization; Process control; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Digital photogrammetric systems; Examination process; High-resolution digital cameras; Instrument systems; Mean shift; PC applications; Physical conditions; Wound assessment; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

At first take input image and then perform skin-tone detection on Hue, saturation, value (HSV) color model. Secondly, mask image is converted in frequency domain. This is achieved by applying Haar-Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), leading to four sub-bands. Sub-band LL (Low-Low band) is used for processing the data. Different levels of DWT are used with Haar transforms. Then the payload (number of bits that can be embedded) is calculated. By tracing skin pixel in one of the given high frequency sub-band, secret data embedding is Performed. First cropped the image then performed all steps for embedding process.

Enhancing and image classification is used for analysis of texture computed tomography (CT). In this paper images of lungs were taken for find various parameters of the texture. Mainly CT images of lungs can be categorised into normal and abnormal. Classification is based on the features extracted from the taken image. Implementation of the system focuses on texture based features e.g. GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) feature plays an vital role in medical field. Selection is based on the twelve various statistical features and seven shape for extraction by applying sequential forward selection algorithm. After application of sequential forward selection algorithm Bayesian classifier was applied among classified data to get best classification. © 2016 IEEE.",Bayesian Classifier; CDF; CLAHE; CT images; GLCM; IP; LCD; Lung Cancer Detection System; MATLAB; SFA; Texture Feature Extraction,Automation; Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Diseases; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image texture; Liquid crystal displays; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Optimization; Process control; Bayesian classifier; CLAHE; CT Image; GLCM; Lung cancer detections; Texture feature extraction; Image classification,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This guidance image maybe input image from video or any other different image. Proposed guided filter has clear output and mainly in this filter edges of video or image are preserved. Also the implementation of guided filter does not require carrying out convolution in spatial domain like conventional bilateral filter.

Processing of human faces discovers many applications in various domains like law enforcement, security surveillance etc. A standard face processing system consists of face detection, face recognition, face tracking and face rendering. Face detection is one of the most premeditated areas of computer vision in image processing not only because of its thought-provoking nature but because of its broad continuum of applications which requires face detection as the first step. The formative Viola-Jones face detection algorithm is discussed in detail and what is the future prospectus of the face detection techniques. The focus is on the benefits and the drawbacks of the Viola-Jones and why it is the most prominent face detection algorithm and how it can be further improvised in order to meet the needs of today's time. To overcome the cons serial implementation of the Viola-Jones algorithm, the algorithm will be implemented on a parallel platform.

Basically video compression is implemented in a video stream frame by frame. Live video processing is a cumbersome task which usually reduces the video transmission rate. So, multimedia data transmission is carried out using suitable hardware modems. The question that arises here is that whether it is possible to achieve live video transmission in a compressed mode without causing loss in data and transmission rate. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a universal coder decoder procedure called UCODEC.

In proposed article, a competent image inpainting technique is demonstrated to resolve this drawback, relied Nonlocal total variation. Initially remotely sensed images are effected by ill posed inverse problems i.e. image destripping, image denoising etc. So it is required to use regularization technique to makes these problems well posed i.e. NLTV method, which is the combination of nonlocal operators and total variation model. Actually this method can make use of the good features of non local operators for textured images and total variation method in edge preserving for color images. To optimize the proposed variation model, an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used in order to get similarity with the original image. And evaluate the outcomes of proposed technique with the existing technique i.e. MNLTV optimized by Bregmanized-operator-splitting algorithm which is a prediction based method. The investigation of all outcomes confirms the efficacy of this rule. © 2016 IEEE.",Inpainting; Multichannel nonlocal total variation; Nonlocal Total Variation; Regularization; Remotely sensed images,Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Inverse problems; Optimization; Remote sensing; Inpainting; Nonlocal; Regularization; Remotely sensed images; Total variation; Image denoising,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

At the beginning of this disease mainly the joints of hand and wrist are affected making hand radiograph analysis very important. Lately manual JSW measurement in hand X-ray digital radiograph of Arthritis patients were in use but it has disadvantages like inaccuracy, inter-reader variability. Also hand radiograph analysis is difficult for radiologist since in all there are 14 number of hand joints. To avoid observer dependency, computer-aided analysis is required. We have proposed the use of image processing techniques using MATLAB to analyze joint space narrowing. In this paper bone boundaries are delineated with Active Shape Model which contains statistical model of bone shape and local texture. Joint positions are identified by local linear mapping based on texture features. We have examined five hand radiograph images affected by RA. Joint location estimate accuracy is 92%.

A 2D image could also be informally called as image honeycomb or an arrangement of pixel values in a hexagonal array. A 3D hexagonal prism lattice image is viewed as an ordered sequence of 2D image honeycombs arranged in the z-direction and the 3D arrangement of voxel values is called a hexagonal prism lattice of voxel values. Most of the 3D hexagonal prism lattice image processing operations are similar to those of 2D image honeycomb processing. 3D images are processed with the help of 3D scanning windows, whereas 2D images are processed with the help of 2D scanning windows. A digital image defined over a hexagonal prism lattice has better curvilinear properties when compared to an image defined over a rectangular prism lattice.

Though many researchers have implemented various algorithms and techniques for character recognition in different languages, ancient characters conversion still poses a big challenge. Because image recognition technology has reached near-perfection when it comes to scanning English and other language text. But optical character recognition (OCR) software capable of digitizing printed Tamil text with high levels of accuracy is still elusive. Only a few people are familiar with the ancient characters and make attempts to convert them into written documents manually. The proposed system overcomes such a situation by converting all the ancient historical documents from inscriptions and palm manuscripts into Tamil digital text format. It converts the digital text format using Tamil unicode. Our algorithm comprises different stages: i) image preprocessing, ii) feature extraction, iii) character recognition and iv) digital text conversion. The first phase conversion accuracy of the Brahmi script rate of our algorithm is 91.57% using the neural network and image zoning method. The second phase of the Vattezhuthu character set is to be implemented. Conversion accuracy of Vattezhuthu is 89.75%. © 2016 IEEE.",Character Recognition; Image Zoning; Machine Translation; Segmentation; Vattezhuthu,Character sets; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Feature extraction; History; Image processing; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Natural language processing systems; Optical character recognition; Translation (languages); Zoning; Conversion accuracies; Historical documents; Image preprocessing; Image recognition technology; Machine translations; Optical character recognition (OCR); Vattezhuthu; Written documents; Character recognition,,Dong M.Wu C.-H.Lu Y.Li H.Tseng Y.-H.Yu L.-C.Lee L.-H.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Learning a single level of dictionary is a well researched topic in image processing and computer vision community. In deep dictionary learning, the first level proceeds like standard dictionary learning; in subsequent layers the (scaled) output coefficients from the previous layer are used as inputs for dictionary learning. This is an unsupervised deep learning approach. The features from the final/deepest layer and representations for subsequent analysis and classification. The seminal paper of stacked denoising autoencoders have shown that robust deep models can be learnt when augmented noisy data is used for training stacked autoencoders instead of clean data. We adopt this idea into the deep dictionary learning framework; instead of using only clean data we augment the training dataset by adding noise; this improves robustness. Experimental evaluation on various benchmark datasets on classification and clustering shows that our proposal yields significant improvement. © 2017 ACM.",Deep learning; Dictionary learning; Unsupervised learning,Deep learning; Image processing; Learning systems; Unsupervised learning; Benchmark datasets; Classification and clustering; Dictionary learning; Experimental evaluation; Image processing and computer vision; Learning approach; Single level; Training dataset; Classification (of information),,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

As earlier TB detection methods do not ensure accurate results, there is an immediate action required to detect the disease with proper tools. To address this issue, a novel mechanism is proposed to detect tuberculosis in chest radiographs. The proposed method includes a three stage process of accurate detection of tuberculosis. In the first stage, lung segmentation using adaptive thresholding is utilized to segment the chest images which have different illumination. The second stage of feature extraction modifies the input image into a set of features which extracts relevant information contained in the chest image. In the third stage of process, k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (k-NN) outputs the decision that the input image is normal or abnormal. The detection process is evaluated using four performance analyzing criteria: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Simulation result shows that the accuracy of our proposed system is 4% more than the graph-cut based TB detection system. A comparison task is also performed to measure the quality of classifier among three classifiers: k-NN, support vector machine and artificial neural network classifier. Results show that k-NN classifier outperforms the other two classifiers with much lower misclassification rate. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive thresholding; classification; feature extraction,Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Extraction; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Image processing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Radiography; Text processing; Adaptive thresholding; Area under the ROC curve; Artificial neural network classifiers; Detection methods; Detection process; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Misclassification rates; Three-stage process; Image segmentation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Coronary angiography techniques for the detection of CAD lead to various complications like artery-dissection, arrhythmia and even death. In this paper we propose an image processing method for detecting and localizing the stenosis regions in the artery. The method is applied on the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)) image of the heart for the detection of stenosis. The region of interest is considered as the coronary arteries and is segmented using vessel enhancement diffusion filter along with dilation and erosion morphology. Centerlines of the segmented arteries are extracted using a fast marching based method. Detection of the stenosis is done by estimating the vessel diameter at each centerline location. The abrupt reduction in the diameter of the arteries is a sign of stenosis. The proposed method is evaluated with a set of images and it gives 86.67% accuracy for detecting the stenosis. This result validates the performance of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.",Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Artery Diseases; DICOM; Morphological Operations; Segmentation,Angiography; Blood vessels; Chemical detection; Computer aided design; Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Diseases; Heart; Image processing; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Processing; Computed tomography angiography; Coronary angiography; Coronary artery disease; Detection and localization; DICOM; Dilation and erosions; Image processing - methods; Morphological operations; Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The existing methods in image distortion analysis, extracts the features that capture the facial details. It extracts four different features (specular reflection, blurriness, chromatic moment, and color diversity) to form the IDA (Image Distortion Analysis) feature vector. The existing methods in image quality assessment, extracts several general image quality features to form IQA (Image Quality Assessment) feature vector. The designed system utilizes a hybrid scheme of both IDA and IQA. In addition, it also extracts the Fourier based and Wavelet based features of the image.

Because of intrinsic features of images (i.e. bulk data capacity, high redundancy etc) encryption of images is different from that of texts and it is generally difficult to handle by traditional methods. Present study proposes a novel symmetric image encryption algorithm using pixel shuffling and reversed binary string of pixel intensity value. Here, the size of the proposed Key-row and Keycol vectors are same as the no of rows and no of columns of the original image. For each pixel, initially binary pattern of pixel intensity value is reversed. In the next step, the new intensity value is stored at a shuffled position. The pixel position is shuffled using two key vectors-Key-row and Keycol. The proposed method is applied on benchmark images and assessment of performance is done using different standard metric for key testing-histogram, correlation, entropy, NPCR and UACI between the original and encrypted image.

The palm print identification problems which are due to affectedness, illumination, impediment, shadow, and blur are undertaken using various methods such as hierarchal feature-based, template matching, graphical record matching, and artificial neural network approach. We propose a line hand featurebased palm print identification system with GLCM feature extraction (including 5 differentiators - Angular Second Moment/Energy, Contrast, Homogeneity/Inverse Difference Moment, Entropy, Correlation) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) artificial neural network as a classifier. The motivation of using this palm print identification is because of its unique solution to the stability-malleability dilemma, where it is the ability to preserve antecedently learnt knowledge (stability), and potency to accommodate new patterns indefinitely (malleability). Another motivation is also used for biometric authentication of a person's identity because of its profusion, where it not only has the information available on the fingerprint, but also it has a far more amount of details in terms of principal lines and wrinkles. Yet compared with the other biometric characteristics, palm print identification has several advantages : low-cost capturing device, low-resolution imaging, and low-officiousness. The experiments show a promising result by using the proposed method that obtained an identification rate of 98.75%.",Biometric authentication; Feature extraction; Glcm differentiators; Identification rate; Line hand feature-based; Low- resolution imaging; Low-cost capturing device; Low-officiousness; Lvq classifier; Malleability; Palm print identification; Profusion; Stability,Authentication; Biometrics; Convergence of numerical methods; Deep neural networks; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Motivation; Neural networks; Template matching; Vector quantization; Biometric authentication; Differentiators; Feature-based; Identification rates; Low costs; Low Resolution Imaging; Low-officiousness; Malleability; Palmprints; Profusion; Palmprint recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The proposed approach employs a new methodology for segmenting the blood vessels from the retinal images more effectively. The overall process is carried out in five steps. The first step is to pre-process the image in order to remove the presence of noise in it and to convert the color image to grey scale image. Second step is the border detection process where the of the blood vessels is are moved by a border detection algorithm. Third step is the texture features are extracted from the detected border and then these features are given as input towards the Improved Fuzzy C Means clustering (IFCM) method in order to produce the membership function. Fourth step is the defuzzification process in which the outputs of the inference obtained for each pixel is combined to a final segmented output which provides a segmented foreground against the background. Final step is the Post-processing process where the unwanted pixels are filled or removed. Our proposed algorithm is tested over 180 images in order to analyse its efficiency. From the experimental results, it has been observed that the proposed segmentation approach provides better segmentation accuracy of 97.8 % in segmenting Retinal blood vessels. © 2016 IEEE.",Improved Fuzzy-C-Means Clustering; Retinal blood vessels; Segmentation; Texture features,Computation theory; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Image processing; Image segmentation; Membership functions; Ophthalmology; Pixels; Automatic segmentations; Fuzzy C means clustering; Grey scale images; Improved fuzzy c-means clustering; Its efficiencies; Retinal blood vessels; Segmentation accuracy; Texture features; Blood vessels,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Color quantization is a technique to reduce the number of unique colors in the image, but excessive color quantization can reduce the visual quality of images.

Most of the image encryption algorithms will generate encrypted images with noise-like or texture-like contents. Hence it's easy to distinguish natural images from encrypted images. The chances of attacks and image analysis by malicious people are more on images with noise-like or texture-like contents. This paper presents an efficient visually meaningful image encryption algorithm that uses integer discrete wavelet transform(DWT) and Arnold transform. The central idea of proposed scheme is to use a reference image to hide the original image in its encrypted form. Arnold transform has been used to transform the encrypted original image content before inserting it into the wavelet sub-bands of the reference image. The final encrypted image will look similar to the reference image, and the original image can be extracted and decrypted by an authorized person who has the valid decryption and data hiding key. © 2016 IEEE.",,Cryptography; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image processing; Wavelet transforms; Arnold transform; Authorized users; Encrypted images; Image encryption algorithm; Image encryptions; Multimedia security; Reference image; Wavelet sub bands; Image texture,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Stud.

Image processing algorithms have been deployed to automatically delineate various layers for autonomous width profiles computation. Classical OCT segmentation algorithms are anchored around gradient and its derivatives. Such pixel information can vary from subject to subject so prior approximations of different layers are imposed in the name of regularization. Regularization restrains the generalization capability of the model which is crucial for segmentation in pathological subjects. The presented approach aims to model signal interactions with a tissue type through back scattered signal characteristics. During prediction phase, given an unknown interaction, the model estimates the probability of signal being backscattered from a tissue type. Sensor's ballistic models are employed to estimate the uncompressed signal statistics. These models have been experimented and evaluated on 5000 AMD (age-related macular degeneration) and 5000 normal B-scans from Duke OCT dataset.

Fortunately, an early stage diagnosis can increase the survival rates of the patients. Sputum cytology is one of the easiest and cost-effective method for lung cancer diagnosis. Chances of misdiagnosis and sampling error related to sputum cytology led to the concept of malignancy associated changes. Malignancy associated changes (MAC) are the subtle changes that happens to the normal appearing cells near or distant from the malignant cells. Literature suggests that these changes can be used as an indicator for lung cancer rather than using malignant cells which are very less in number compared to the normal appearing cells in sputum cytology images. The proposed work is intended to detect cells with MAC from sputum smear images. Analysis of nuclei texture features of sputum cell nuclei using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and Gray Level Run Length Matrix from both normal and cancer patients revealed that both type of cells could be differentiated. Among 110 texture features calculated for each nuclei, a set of 35 features which clearly distinguishes normal cells and normal appearing cells were chosen. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the cells into two classes i.e cells with MAC and cells without MAC. This study demonstrates that the presence of MAC cells in conventional microscopic sputum cytology images can be identified using image processing techniques and it can have some significance in the early detection of lung cancer. © 2016 IEEE.",image analysis; lung cancer; Malignancy Associated Changes; sputum cytology; texture features,Biological organs; Cells; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image analysis; Image processing; Support vector machines; Cost-effective methods; Early-stage diagnosis; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Image processing technique; Lung Cancer; Lung cancer diagnosis; Malignancy Associated Changes; Texture features; Cytology,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Stud.

Features extracted by Gabor wavelet have similar information as visualized by the receptive field of simple cells in the visual cortex of the mammalian brains. This motivates researchers to use Gabor wavelet for feature extraction. Gabor wavelet features are used for many multimedia applications such as stereo matching, face and facial expression recognition (FER), texture representation for segmentation. This motivates us to analyze Gabor features to evaluate their effectiveness in representing an image. In this paper, three major characteristics of Gabor features are established viz., (i) Real coefficients of Gabor wavelet alone is sufficient enough to represent an image; (ii) Local Gabor wavelet features with overlapping regions represent an image more accurately as compared to the global Gabor features and the local features extracted for the non-overlapping regions; and (iii) Real coefficients of overlapping regions are more robust to radiometric changes as compared to the features extracted from both global and local (non-overlapping regions) by using real, imaginary and magnitude information of a Gabor wavelet. The efficacy and effectiveness of these findings are evaluated by reconstructing the original image using the extracted features, and subsequently the reconstructed image is compared with the original image. Experimental results show that the local Gabor wavelet features extracted from overlapping regions represent an image more efficiently than the global and non-overlapping region-based features. Experimental results also show that the real coefficients alone is sufficient enough to represent an image more accurately as compared to the imaginary and magnitude informations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Feature extraction; Gabor wavelet; Mean square error and Correlation coefficients,Computer vision; Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Image processing; Mammals; Mean square error; Correlation coefficient; Facial expression recognition; Gabor wavelet features; Gabor wavelets; Magnitude information; Multimedia applications; Performance analysis; Texture representation; Stereo image processing,"Bhuyan, M.K.; Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: mkb@iitg.ernet.in",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962197404

If the shares are printed onto transparencies, the secret image can be visually revealed only when a subset of k or more transparencies are stacked together otherwise nothing will be revealed. Progressive Visual Secret Sharing (PVSS) also allows the decryption of secret image by stacking of physical transparencies but clarity and contrast of the decoded secret image will be increased progressively with the number of stacked shares. Most of the existing researches on PVSS suffer with the common problems like space-inefficiency(pixel expansion) and noise-like shares. This paper proposes a novel PVSS scheme with four or more number of space-efficient as well as meaningful shares.

It facilitates integration of copyright protection and integrity verification into the same scheme. However, most of such existing state of art approaches either lacked the feature of tamper detection and original content recovery or provided an approximation using coarser block level approach. The proposed self recoverable dual watermarking scheme integrates all the aforementioned functionalities of copyright protection, tamper detection and recovery into one scheme. The scheme is independent of the order of embedding of robust and fragile watermarks as these are embedded in different regions of the cover image. It performs tamper detection and recovery, both at the pixel level. The scheme obtains recovery information for each 2×2 image block in just eight bits which are further encoded to only four bits via mapping table. This reduction in recovery bits allows efficient embedding of copyright information which is tested against comprehensive set of attacks. The scheme is found to be robust against noises, filtering, histogram equalization, rotation, jpeg compression, motion blur etc. Besides the normalized cross correlation value, the evaluation of the extracted copyright information is also being done using various objective error metrics based on mutual relation between pixels, their values and locations respectively. The imperceptibility and visual quality of the watermarked as well as recovered image is found to be satisfactorily high. Three major categories of images: natural, texture as well as satellite have been tested in the proposed scheme. Even minute alterations can be chalked out as the detection accuracy rate has been enumerated on pixel basis. The scheme can tolerate tampering ratios upto 50 percent though the visual quality of the recovered image deteriorates with increasing tampering ratio. Comparative results based on normalized cross correlation, probability of false acceptance, probability of false rejection and peak signal to noise ratio metrics validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme over other existing state of art approaches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Copyright protection; Dual watermarking; Integrity verification; Normalized cross correlation (NCC); Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR); Probability of false acceptance (PFA); Probability of false rejection (PFR); Self recoverable,Image processing; Information filtering; Pixels; Probability; Recovery; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Watermarking; Copyright protections; Dual watermarking; False acceptance; False rejection; Integrity verifications; Normalized cross correlation; Peak signal to noise ratio; Self recoverable; Copyrights,"Singh, P.; Motilal Nehru National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: priyankaap@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957646498

The main challenge in contrast enhancement is that an algorithm suitable for low contrast distorted images does not suit for high contrast distorted images. In this paper, an efficient contrast enhancement algorithm with automated parameterization is proposed using the concept of genetic algorithm and fuzzy intensification operator. Main focus of the proposed method is to improve the visibility information of an image by manipulating their intensity information. Simulation results of the proposed fuzzy-genetic based method were compared with standard existing methods such as log, gamma, linear contrast stretching, histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization and rule based fuzzy method using their default parameter values. Performance of the proposed and existing methods on very low, low, moderate, high and very high levels of contrast distorted images were quantitatively measured using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and feature similarity index measure (FSIM). The PSNR, SSIM and FSIM values were statistically analysed by two-way ANOVA. Results of this experiment inferred that (a) the contrast enhancement techniques performed well when the level of distortions were very low to moderate, (b) contrast enhancement was better in the proposed fuzzy-genetic based method than other existing methods, and (c) overall, the proposed fuzzy-genetic based method performed well on very low to very high levels of distorted images with higher PSNR, SSIM and FSIM values than other existing methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Contrast enhancement; Fuzzy intensification operator; Genetic algorithm; Quantitative analysis,Chemical analysis; Computer vision; Equalizers; Genetic algorithms; Graphic methods; Image processing; Image segmentation; Signal to noise ratio; Adaptive histogram equalization; Contrast Enhancement; Fuzzy intensification; Histogram equalizations; Image contrast enhancement; Image processing and computer vision; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity index measures (SSIM); Algorithms,"Satheesh Kumar, J.; Department of Computer Applications, Bharathiar UniversityIndia; email: jsathee@rediffmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982843274

First, impulse locations are detected by applying the combination of sparse denoising and thresholding, based on sparse and overcomplete representations of the corrupted image. This stage optimally selects threshold values so that the sum of the number of false alarms and missed detections obtained at a particular noise level is the minimum. In the second stage, impulses, detected in the first stage, are considered as the missing pixels or holes and subsequently these holes are filled-up using an image inpainting method.

Today the de facto standard for such reconstruction is compressed sensing (CS). CS produces high quality images (with minimal perceptual loss); but such reconstructions are time consuming, requiring solving a complex optimization problem. In this work we propose to ‘learn’ the reconstruction from training samples using an autoencoder. Our work is based on the universal function approximation capacity of neural networks. The training time for the autoencoder is large, but is offline and hence does not affect performance during operation. During testing/operation, our method requires only a few matrix vector products and hence is significantly faster than CS based methods. In fact, for MRI it is fast enough for real-time reconstruction (the images are reconstructed as fast as they are acquired) with only slight degradation of image quality; for CT our reconstruction speed is slightly slower than required for real-time reconstruction. However, in order to make the autoencoder suitable for our problem, we depart from the standard Euclidean norm cost function of autoencoders and use a robust l1-norm instead.

This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. For instance a disease named little leaf disease is a hazardous disease found in pine trees in United States. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves. This paper presents an algorithm for image segmentation technique which is used for automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. It also covers survey on different diseases classification techniques that can be used for plant leaf disease detection. Image segmentation, which is an important aspect for disease detection in plant leaf disease, is done by using genetic algorithm. © 2017 China Agricultural University",Classification; Genetic algorithm; Image processing; Plant disease detection,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Image processing; Plants (botany); Productivity; Soft computing; Agricultural productivity; Automatic Detection; Automatic technique; Classification technique; Disease detection; Plant disease; Segmentation techniques; Softcomputing techniques; Image segmentation; detection method; disease; genetic algorithm; image classification; image processing; leaf; numerical method; survey; United States,"Singh, V.; Computer Science Department, IMS Engineering CollegeIndia; email: vijai.cs@gmail.com",,China Agricultural University,22143173,,,,English,Inf.

The differentiation between weed and crop and weed removal are the two challenging tasks for the farmers especially in the Indian sugarcane cultivation scenario. The automatic weed detection and removal becomes a vital task for improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the agricultural processes. The detection of weeds by the robotic model employs a Raspberry Pi based control system placed in a moving vehicle. An automated image classification system has been designed which extracts leaf textures and employs a fuzzy real-time classification technique. Morphological operators are applied to extract circular leaf patterns in different scales from the leaf images. An optimal set of features have been identified for the characterization of crops and weeds in sugarcane fields. A weed detecting robotic prototype is designed and developed using a Raspberry Pi micro controller and suitable input output subsystems such as cameras, small light sources and motors with power systems. The prototype's control incorporates the weed detection mechanism using a Raspbian operating system support and python programming.

Moreover, the health and cost burden of CW are escalating at a disturbing rate due to a global rise in population of elderly and diabetic cases. The conventional approach includes visual contour, sketches, or more rarely tracings. However, such conventional techniques bring forth infection, pain, allergies. Furthermore, these methods are subjective as well as time-consuming. As such, nowadays, non-touching and non-invasive CW monitoring system based on imaging techniques are gaining importance. They not only reduce patients’ discomfort but also provide rapid wound diagnosis and prognosis.

Existing model of data organization and processing in Hadoop using HDFS and MapReduce are ideally tailored for search and data parallel applications, for which there is no need of data dependency with its neighboring/adjacent data. However, many scientific applications such as image mining, data mining, knowledge data mining, and satellite image processing are dependent on adjacent data for processing and analysis. In this paper, we identify the requirements of the overlapped data organization and propose a two-phase extension to HDFS and MapReduce programming model, called XHAMI, to address them. The extended interfaces are presented as APIs and implemented in the context of image processing application domain. We demonstrated effectiveness of XHAMI through case studies of image processing functions along with the results. Although XHAMI has little overhead in data storage and input/output operations, it greatly enhances the system performance and simplifies the application development process. Our proposed system, XHAMI, works without any changes for the existing MapReduce models and can be utilized by many applications where there is a requirement of overlapped data.

In the former method we identified segmentation and object detection as being responsible for consuming most of the global processing time. While in the latter, as segmentation was not used, shape-based object detection was the compute-intensive task identified. Experimental results show that the accelerated method running on multi-GPU systems for blood detection in WCE images is on average 265 times faster than the original CPU version and is able to process 344 frames per second.

At the current rate of increasing automobiles, speed determination has become a major concern in avoiding fatal accidents. Radar technology is the current productive way used for speed detection. In this paper we have come up with an alternative method of using image and video processing which can overcome the drawbacks of radar guns. It uses the live video stream from the surveillance cameras for calculating the speed of the vehicle. The speed of vehicle is updated every half a second, hence keeping a track on acceleration and deceleration of vehicle in the field of view of the camera. Any violation in the speed laws can be observed and notified to the officer of law. This helps in keeping track of the speed violators and saves the effort of an officer holding a radar gun on the highways. The video can also be saved for future use. The speed calculated shows an error of only 3% in real time and is tested in many experiments.

MRI brain has structural symmetry between the right cerebral hemisphere (RCH) and left cerebral hemisphere (LCH) of brain cerebrum. Any brain abnormalities due to tumors, hemorrhage, etc disturbs the similarity between the two hemispheres. We split the right and left hemisphere of MRI image using central vertical line and compare the histograms using similarity measures. Fifteen histogram similarity measures (HSM) are used to generate the threshold vector (TV). The TV obtained from training images using fuzzy c means based clustering technique. TV values are helpful to classify the MR images with the help of artificial neural network (ANN) classifier in the testing process. Hundred of axial images of normal and abnormal subjects are taken for training process. We test our algorithm with 66 volumes collected from three popular repositories. The average of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rates are 98%, 96% and 94%. The error rates are 2% false alarm and 4% missed alarm.

Clustering algorithms are part of data mining algorithm that groups the data into various number of given clusters. All the data points in one cluster have similar properties based on which they are clustered i.e. each cluster has minimum difference between its points and maximum difference from other cluster data points. The proposed algorithm uses k-mean algorithm and firefly to cluster image pixels into k cluster for segmentation. Since k-mean clustering algorithm is gets trapped in local optima it is optimized using firefly algorithm. Swarm intelligence based algorithms forms the basis of the firefly algorithm which has several application and used to solve optimization problems. Firefly algorithm has been applied in many research and optimization areas. Firefly algorithm and its hybridized version have been used to solve various problems successfully.

This paper presents a novel method for logo based document image retrieval, when a query document containing logo is given as an input. Logo from the query document is extracted based on energy contributed by connected components of document image after using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Segmentation depicts how the object is composed in an image and aids in extracting useful information from it so that interpretation becomes easier. Segmentation may be regarded as an essential pre-processing stage that will help to acquire objects that can be efficiently utilized in further steps of processing. This extraction of objects is helpful in almost every field today such as medical, forensic, industry and agriculture. Instead of using pixels, DWT make use of waves that helps to extract object efficiently. To raise the segmentation accuracy further an improved Fuzzy-C Mean with Edge and Local Information (FELICM) based gray stretch strategy is suggested that will help to segment an image by obtaining an optimistic and adaptive threshold by incorporating FELICM and gray stretch on coefficients with low frequency and edge enhancement on coefficients with high frequency after DWT. Existing and the proposed strategies have been compared using parameters Accuracy, Uniformity, Shape measurement and Regional Contrast. © 2016 IEEE.",Discrete Wavelet Transform; Image Segmentation; Thresholding FELICM,Discrete wavelet transforms; Image segmentation; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive thresholds; Edge enhancements; High frequency HF; Improved fuzzy c-means; Local information; Segmentation accuracy; Shape measurements; Thresholding; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Brain tumor detection is one of the most widely used applications by vast researchers. In this paper a novel approach is presented for detection of affected mass (tumor) in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two level wavelet transform is used to decompose the brain image with mother wavelet 'db6'. The horizontal, vertical and the diagonal components at both the levels are further decomposed to level five using histogram for each of the component using one dimensional wavelet transform. By finding global minima at level five, and then mapped at the component histogram, a threshold value is found out. The component then is thresholded using this adaptive threshold. The original image is then reconstructed with the obtained components using this course segmentation. The approximation component at level one is unaltered. Lastly a windowing technique is used to eliminate the false detection due to light in-homogeneity or due to hard tissues, which uses a window based threshold. Results after fine segmentation showed that normal patient images showed complete black region in the final segmented image whereas malignant images showed the region of interest after segmentation. The MRI images from a research institute were obtained and the results after segmentation were validated from an expert from the same research institute. © 2016 IEEE.",adaptive threshold; course segmentation; fine segmentation; global minima; Magnetic resonance images; wavelet transform; windowing technique,Brain; Brain mapping; Diagnosis; Graphic methods; Image compression; Image processing; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Tumors; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive thresholds; Adaptive wavelets; Fine segmentations; Global minima; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Region of interest; Research institutes; Windowing techniques; Image segmentation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Further, these segmentation masks are combined and updated using a Markov random field model to generate the final foreground segmentation.

One of the major limitations of some of these images is their resolution. Therefore, image resolution enhancement is the first necessary step in image processing. Image resolution enhancement is the process of modifying the images under consideration so that obtained image is more appropriate than the original image for required application. Image resolution is important aspect of any image. Good quality image i.e. high-resolution image produces better results in image processing application. Resolution enhancement can be done in various domains such as spatial & transform domains. Different transform domain methods that are used for image resolution enhancement are namely, Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT), Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) etc. Out of these, DT-CWT is found to be one of the most effective methods. In this paper, we have analyzed different approaches based on interpolation for image resolution enhancement. The discussion and comparison of different transform domain methods for image resolution enhancement is carried out on satellite benchmark images and analytical results showing the supremacy among these methods for image resolution enhancement is presented. © 2017 IEEE.",Bicubic Interpolation; Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT); Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Satellite image resolution enhancement; Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT),Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image coding; Image compression; Image processing; Image resolution; Intelligent systems; Interpolation; Partial discharges; Satellites; Bicubic interpolation; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT); Image processing applications; Image resolution enhancements; Resolution enhancement; Satellite images; Stationary wavelet transforms; Wavelet transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Quality based classification of these products is being carried out manually in the industry which is tedious and expensive. Computer Vision systems can be used to automate the classification process. Automation can reduce the production cost and improve the overall quality. A computer vision system captures the image of the underlying object and transmits it to an image processor. The processor, after processing the image, presents it to a pattern recognizer. The recognizer performs the quality assessments and classifies the underlying object into pre-specified quality classes. Previous studies in this regard used minimal features to perform classification which reduces the accuracy. In the proposed approach more features are used which significantly improves the automation process. Automation process faces several challenges like identifying appropriate features and the best classifier.

Skin lesions show distinct color variations as they evolve from benign to malignant one. The use of different color spaces can provide the best discriminative information of lesions embedded in a particular color channel and used in efficient segmentation of a digital image. A simple and efficient method for the automatic segmentation of clinical images using colorspace analysis and improved binary thresholding algorithm is proposed. Clinical images taken from normal mobile cameras have the inherent problem of improperly illumined background compared to dermoscopic images. The proposed algorithm corrects these constraints with initial pre-processing steps of adjustments of clinical image. The algorithm has been evaluated using 175 images from different online public databases. The efficiency of the overall segmentation process is carried out by calculation of similarity matrices for segmented lesions from each color channel used. The framework is able to differentiate and extract the cancerous lesion from the background skin with around 94% accuracy with the preferred choice of color channel. © 2016 IEEE.,Color Space; Dermoscopy; Medical Image Processing; Melanoma; Thresholding,Color; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Digital image storage; Image processing; Image segmentation; Intelligent control; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Oncology; Power control; Power electronics; Automatic segmentations; Calculation of similarities; Color space; Dermoscopy; Melanoma; Pre-processing step; Segmentation process; Thresholding; Color image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

There are several basic experiments in physics which help the students understand the basics of classical physics. However, the rising cost of laboratory infrastructure and costly equipment to conduct these experiments make it difficult for schools, in developing countries like India to build laboratories. This paper presents innovative web-based laboratory for physics to study equations of motion. One such experiment in equations of motion is the determination of acceleration due to gravity of a free falling object. However, measuring the distance traveled and time taken by a free-falling object is a tedious process. To overcome this challenge, a computer vision based system is presented which can measure the distance traveled and time taken by the object during free fall. By the technique of object detection in computer vision, the free-falling object is detected and tracked. The system is implemented using OpenCV libraries.

The advantage of MATLAB is, it is widely available, continuously updated and has wider reach. In our approach, mixed pixel areas are detected using super pixel segmentation of colour and depth, and consolidate them to lost pixel regions. The consolidated regions are replete with neighbouring depth information based on a Robust Edge-Stop (RES) Function; distance transform values of colour edge pixels are used to form this function.

This paper proposes a novel image processing sign language detection framework that employs MAdaline network for classification purpose. This paper mainly highlights two novel aspects, firstly it introduces an advanced feature set comprising of seven distinct features that has not been used widely for sign language interpretation purpose, more over utilization of such features negates the cumbersome step of cropping of irrelevant background image, thus reducing system complexity. Secondly it suggests a possible solution of the concerned problem can be obtained using an extension of the traditional Adaline network, formally termed as MAdaline Network. Although the concept of MAdaline network has originated much earlier, the provision of application of this framework in this domain definitely help in designing an improved sign language interpreting interface. The newly formulated framework has been implemented to recognize standardized American sign language containing 26 English alphabets from 'A' to 'Z'. The performance of the proposed algorithm has also been compared with the standardized algorithms, and in each case the former one outperformed its contender algorithms by a large margin establishing the efficiency of the same. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaline; American sign language; least mean square; MAdaline; Widrow-hoff's learning rule,Artificial intelligence; Audition; ADALINE; American sign language; Learning rules; Least mean squares; Madaline; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Symp.

Object recognition have immense of applications in the field of monitoring and surveillance, medical analysis, robot localization and navigation etc. The appearance of an object can be varied due to scene clutter, photometric effects, changes in shape and viewpoints of the object. The the recognition should be invariant to viewpoint changes and object transformations, robust to noise and occlusion. This work aims at formulating a technique that consist of two stages. For the first stage, the query image is categorized using a classifier. For classifier optimization we have implemented two types of classifiers- Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier that make use of GIST features and k-nearest neighbour(kNN) classifier that make use of Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT). GIST based SVM classification is done using different kernels such as Linear kernel, Polynomial kernel and Gaussian kernel. SIFT features are invariant to affine transformations of the images. SIFT features of the images are extracted and a similarity matrix is formed by matching these SIFT features. Then a k-nearest neighbour(kNN) classifier is implemented on the similarity matrix. GIST feature based SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel showed better classification accuracy than SIFT feature based kNN classifier.

Scene classification is the process that analyzes the properties of various image features of a scene and organizes the scenes into categories. Programmed techniques for correlating scenes with labels have a high potential for improving the performance of computer vision applications such as searching, retrieval and object recognition.

The performance measure of the classifier was evaluated using confusion matrix and classification accuracy. We considered MIT-8 scene category, leaves, Caltech-20 and deer data sets for our experiments. The classification accuracy was found to be good. Results show that classification accuracy is increased significantly for classification using GIST features in SVM classifiers.

According to the studies, there are different types of skin cancers like melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carci- noma (SCC). Melanoma is a condition where the production of melanin is significantly reduced because of the dysfunctionality of melanocyte cells. One of the major factor that affects the melanocyte cell is sunburn due to the ultraviolet rays from the sun. The disorder can be identified by the shape, color and texture of skin lesion. The skin lesion can be normally separated into three as benign, atypical and melanoma. A benign skin lesion is a normal skin, atypical skin lesion may or may not be cancerous and melanoma is surely a cancerous one.

The precise estimation of volume of the abnormality aids better prognosis, treatment planning and dose estimation. The work put forth in this paper has proposed and implemented a semi-automatic technique that yields appropriate segmented regions from MR brain images. The Segmentation technique here utilizes fusion of information beyond human perception from MR images to develop a fused feature map. The information beyond human perception include second order derivatives that are computed from an image which are discussed in detail in relevant section of this paper. This obtained feature map acts as a stopping function for the initialized curve in the framework of an active contour model to obtain a well segmented region of interest. The segmentation is carried out in all the slices of a particular dataset with initialization of the active contour required only on the first slice which makes this method fast. The obtained segmentation results are compared with ground truth segmentation results obtained from experts manually using Jackard’s Co-efficient of Similarity and Overlap index. The boundaries of the segmented regions are utilized in surveyor’s algorithm to compute the volume of the tumors with high accuracy. The efficacy of this volume estimation technique is illustrated with comparison to mostly used ABC/2 method and cavalieri method.

The proposed method used for the design of two-dimensional (2-D) two-channel linear-phase FIR perfect-reconstruction filter bank. In this method, the fan shaped, diamond shaped and checkerboard shaped filters are designed. The quadratic measure of the error function between the passband and stopband of the filter has been used an objective function. First, the low-pass analysis filter is designed and then the PR condition has been expressed as a set of linear constraints on the corresponding synthesis low-pass filter. Subsequently, the corresponding synthesis filter is designed using the eigenfilter design method with linear constraints. The newly designed 2-D filters are used in translation invariant pyramidal directional filter bank (TIPDFB) for reduction of speckle noise in ultrasound images.

In this scheme, DWT is applied on ROI (region of interest) of the medical image to get different frequency subbands of its wavelet decomposition. On the low frequency subband LL of the ROI, block-SVD is applied to get different singular matrices. A pair of elements with similar values is identified from the left singular value matrix of these selected blocks. The values of these pairs are modified using certain threshold to embed a bit of watermark content. Appropriate threshold is chosen to achieve the imperceptibility and robustness of medical image and watermark contents respectively. For authentication and identification of original medical image, one watermark image (logo) and other text watermark have been used. The watermark image provides authentication whereas the text data represents electronic patient record (EPR) for identification. At receiving end, blind recovery of both watermark contents is performed by a similar comparison scheme used during the embedding process. The proposed algorithm is applied on various groups of medical images like X-ray, CT scan and mammography. This scheme offers better visibility of watermarked image and recovery of watermark content due to DWT-SVD combination. Moreover, use of Hamming error correcting code (ECC) on EPR text bits reduces the BER and thus provides better recovery of EPR. The performance of proposed algorithm with EPR data coding by Hamming code is compared with the BCH error correcting code and it is found that later one perform better. A result analysis shows that imperceptibility of watermarked image is better as PSNR is above 43 dB and WPSNR is above 52 dB for all set of images. In addition, robustness of the scheme is better than existing scheme for similar set of medical images in terms of normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) and bit-error-rate (BER). An analysis is also carried out to verify the performance of the proposed scheme for different size of watermark contents (image and EPR data). It is observed from analysis that the proposed scheme is also appropriate for watermarking of color image. Using proposed scheme, watermark contents are extracted successfully under various noise attacks like JPEG compression, filtering, Gaussian noise, Salt and pepper noise, cropping, filtering and rotation. Performance comparison of proposed scheme with existing schemes shows proposed scheme has better robustness against different types of attacks. Moreover, the proposed scheme is also robust under set of benchmark attacks known as checkmark attacks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Blind watermarking; Electronic patient record (EPR); Error correcting code; Image and text watermarking; Medical image security,Authentication; Bit error rate; Codes (symbols); Discrete wavelet transforms; Errors; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image analysis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Image watermarking; Matrix algebra; Medical imaging; Recovery; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Blind watermarking; Electronic patient record; Error correcting code; Medical image security; Text watermarking; Computerized tomography,"Thakkar, F.N.; Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Motilal Nehru National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: falgungcet@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989869187

In this scheme a digital medical image is partitioned into region of interest (ROI) and the region of non interest (RONI). To detect and localize ROI tampering with high accuracy pixel wise positional and relational bits are calculated. Positional bit is calculated with respect to MSBs, row and column of the pixel. Relational bit shows the relation between MSBs. Two original LSBs of each ROI pixel are replace by their corresponding positional and relational bits. Original LSBs of ROI pixels are concatenated and embedded in RONI for ROI recovery in the case of tampering. Multiple watermarks i.e. electronic patient record (EPR), hospitals logo and LSBs of ROI are embedded simultaneously as a robust watermark in RONI using IWT-SVD hybrid transform. The proposed scheme is blind and free from false positive detection. Various experiments have been carried out on different medical imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, tamper detection, localization, recovery and computation time.

Gujral Punjab Techncial University, Jalandhar-Kapurthala Highway, Kapurthala, Punjab  144603, India","Face detection is a prominent research domain in the field of digital image processing. Out of various algorithms developed so far, Viola–Jones face detection has been highly successful. However, because of its complex nature, there is need to do more exploration in its various phases including training as well as actual face detection to find the scope of further improvement in terms of efficiency as well as accuracy under various constraints so as to detect and process the faces in real time. Its training phase for the screening of large amount of Haar features and generation of cascade classifiers is quite tedious and computationally intensive task. Any modification for improvement in its features or cascade classifiers requires re-training of all the features through example images, which are very large in number. Therefore, there is need to enhance the computational efficiency of training process of Viola–Jones face detection algorithm so that further enhancement in this framework is made easy. There are three main contributions in this research work. Firstly, we have achieved a considerable speedup by parallelizing the training as well as detection of rectangular Haar features based upon Viola–Jones framework on GPU. Secondly, the analysis of features selected through AdaBoost has been done, which can give intuitiveness in developing more innovative and efficient techniques for selecting competitive classifiers for the task of face detection, which can further be generalized for any type of object detection. Thirdly, implementation of parallelization techniques of modified version of Viola–Jones face detection algorithm in combination with skin color filtering to reduce the search space has been done. We have been able to achieve considerable reduction in the search space and time cost by using the skin color filtering in conjunction with the Viola–Jones algorithm. Time cost reduction of the order of 54.31% at the image resolution of 640*480 of GPU time versus CPU time has been achieved by the proposed parallelized algorithm. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",Face detection; Features analysis; GPU computing; Skin color filtering; Viola–Jones,Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Color; Computational efficiency; Cost reduction; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image resolution; Signal detection; Cascade classifiers; Face detection algorithm; Features analysis; GPU computing; Parallelization techniques; Parallelized algorithm; Research domains; Skin-color filtering; Face recognition,"Mutneja, V.; I.K.

Associated 3D measurements can facilitate surgical planning and postoperative assessment. Further, lifelike 3D visualization of human face is helpful as a communication/training tool for medical professionals/trainees. In this backdrop, we present a 3D surface imaging and measurement platform that is both flexible and accurate. Specifically, our systems consists of a stereo camera and two monocular cameras, which can be individually positioned and focused to obtain crisp images. From those images, true-to-scale reconstruction was achieved with accuracy levels between 97.46% and 99.83% in various oculofacial measurements. Significantly, such levels of accuracy are comparable to those achieved by inflexible legacy systems. Additionally, our system, consisting of discrete cameras, requires minimal training to operate, and hence could find use in telemedicine. © 2016 IEEE.",3D reconstruction; Oculoplastic surgery; Pre-operative planning; Structured-light imaging; True-to-scale autocalibration,Cameras; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Legacy systems; Surgery; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D reconstruction; Auto calibration; Medical professionals; Monocular cameras; Multi-camera networks; Pre-operative planning; Structured-light imaging; Surgical planning; Stereo image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

This limits their usage for the upcoming academic research institutes and also their reach to the mass market in general. Among the most popular and frugal head mounts, Google Cardboard (GC) and Wearality2 are video-see-through devices that can provide immersible AR and VR experiences with a smartphone. Stereo-rendering of camera feed and overlaid information on smartphone helps us experience AR with GC. These frugal devices have limited user-input capability, allowing user interactions with GC such as head tilting, magnetic trigger and conductive lever. Our paper proposes a reliable and intuitive gesture based interaction technique for these frugal devices. The hand gesture recognition employs the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) based on human skin pixels and tracks segmented foreground using optical flow to detect hand swipe direction for triggering a relevant event. Realtime performance is achieved by implementing the hand gesture recognition module on a smartphone and thus reducing the latency.

Vision loss is due to DR is preventable with regular checkups at the earlier stages. The presence of exudates is the basic signs of DR. Hence, exudates detection becomes a major problem-solving task, in which retinal images plays a vital role. In this paper, a technique is proposed depending on morphological closing operations which are in image processing is used to identify exudates from retinal image. At the starting phase, the retinal image must be preprocessed, where at first the image which is in RGB color format is altered to the image of HSI color format and on Intensity-band of HSI color format average filter is performed to reduce noise and subsequently contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization is performed to normalize the image. In subsequent phase, exudates are identified using morphological closing operation and then Nilblack's thresholding is applied.

For any vehicle to be recognized, vehicle license plate detection will play a major significant role in this active world. For finding vehicles commonly used in field of security and safety system, LPDR plays a significant role and we need to recognize vehicles registration number at a certain distance. This paper has four major steps as follows: Preprocessing of captured image, Extracting license number plate region, Segmentation and Character Recognition of license plate. In pre-processing the desired vehicle image is taken through the digital camera, brightness of image is adjusted, noise removal using filters and image is converted to gray scale. Exactions of license plate region consist of finding the edges in the image where exact location of licenses plate is located and crop it into rectangular frame. Segmentation plays a vital role in vehicle licenses plate recognition; the legibility of character recognition completely relies on the segmentation done. The approach which we have used is simple but appropriate. First we segmented all characters in the image (LP) using Bounding box method. Finally, recognition of each character is done. The template matching method is used for recognition each character in the vehicle license plate. © 2016 IEEE.",Bounding Box and filter; Licenses Plate Detection; Noise removal; Recognition; Segmentation,Accidents; Character recognition; Image processing; Image segmentation; Optical character recognition; Security systems; Template matching; Vehicles; And filters; Noise removal; Plate detections; Recognition; Registration number; Template matching method; Vehicle license plates; Vehicle number plate; License plates (automobile),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Proc.

One such challenge is salt water crocodile. In general, crocodiles are seen in fresh water like lake and river. Nowadays it is migrated to salt water. These salt water crocodiles are serious threat to travelers and sailors. This issue is addressed through solution like Ocean Observation System (OOS), which integrates video frame system with target detection. Development of OOS is a challenging task due to various image processing modules like background occlusion, object deformation, scale changes, etc. Detection algorithms using global feature descriptor such as colour, failed to produce reliable detection, when the background image has similar colour. In case of motion pictures, reliability of detection becomes less while using local feature descriptors like Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) etc., As target detection through such single feature representation does not produce reliable results, we propose a Multi-Feature Joint Descriptor (MFJD) method in this paper. An optimization of crocodile detection process is obtained through the implementation of two different MFJD and by comparing their performance on detection rate. The feature descriptors considered in the proposed MFJD algorithms includes Colour, HOG and SIFT. The simulated results ensure the reliability of detection achieved through MFJD detection process. © 2016 IEEE.",Crocodile detection; Feature fusion; HOG; Image detection; MFJD; SIFT,Color; Image analysis; Image processing; Optimization; Signal detection; Feature fusion; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Image detection; Image Processing Module; MFJD; Ocean observation systems; Scale invariant feature transforms; SIFT; Feature extraction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Though, some recently developed image processing techniques successfully oppressed by other sections have been infrequently, if ever, experimented on celestial observations. Here we present a new idea of super resolution of Astronomical objects using Back propagation algorithm. 'Super-resolution' is efficient in improving the excellence of analysis of diffused sources formerly unobserved by the background noise, efficiently rising the depth of obtainable observations. Higher-resolution image out of a set of low resolution frames can be obtained through super-resolution. Super-resolution is viable only for point sources which have negligible dimensions, then for wide-ranging objects the knowledge about intensity vacillation at angular prevalence is irreversibly mislaid. Again obtaining super resolved image for extended sources(e.g. comets, meteoroids, etc) is a new challenge if the speed of the object is very high. Acquiring High resolution images of celestial objects from ground based telescopes is intricate and often requires computational post processing techniques to remove blur caused by atmospheric commotion. Even images obtained through satellite imaging are compressed and sent to earth. So there is need for Super resolution of those compressed or noisy images. So, here we simply implement Super-resolution for Astronomical objects using Back propagation algorithm to overcome lost information and challenges for high speedy celestial objects. The purpose is to super resolve high speedy celestial objects whose analysis may in future help to prevent collisions of such celestial objects with earth and also avoid future solar system damage. © 2016 IEEE.",Astronomical observations; Back propagation algorithm; Bicubic interpolation; Blur sigma factor; Gaussian kernel; Gradient descent function; High resolution image; Linear kernel; Low resolution images; Mean square error function; Sparse toeplitz matrix; Super resolution,Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Earth (planet); Matrix algebra; Mean square error; Optical resolving power; Astronomical observation; Bicubic interpolation; Gaussian kernels; Gradient descent; High resolution image; Linear kernel; Low resolution images; Sigma factor; Super resolution; Toeplitz matrices; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The fMRI reveals the functional activity caused by the Blood Oxygenated Level Dependent (BOLD) signals in the brain. The visual image reconstruction allows to translate neural brain activity pattern into the visual image (stimulus) that has caused the corresponding brain activity. The stimulus may be graphical characters, face images, handwritten characters and natural images. The proposed technique aims to develop a novel framework for visual image reconstruction of natural images from fMRI. The exact reconstruction of natural images is challenging due to its complexity. The classification of image prior plays an important role in improving the accuracy of reconstruction. Since the image prior consists of multiple categories, like Gabor wavelet transform, Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Haar feature transform, Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) were tried on image prior. The extracted features are fed into the multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier followed by k-means clustering. An analysis on reconstruction done using different feature extraction techniques revealed that the Gabor feature extraction gave the highest accuracy in final results. The reconstruction of natural images was achieved with an accuracy of 80% till now. Also 70% accuracy was achieved in identifying the category and reconstructing the test stimulus from a real time test fMRI voxel responses. The proposed work focuses on developing an accurate, less complex and automatic software technique for visual image reconstruction of natural images. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature extraction techniques; fMRI voxel responses (BOLD); Hybrid Bayesian Framework; k-means clustering; Multiclass SVM classifier; Visual Image Reconstruction,Brain; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Complex networks; Discrete cosine transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Functional neuroimaging; Image classification; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurophysiology; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Bayesian frameworks; Feature extraction techniques; fMRI voxel responses (BOLD); K-means clustering; Multiclass SVM; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Reversible data hiding is one among the many methods to securely store message into a cover media like image. Drawbacks of this method were overcome with the help of novel approaches like Separable reversible data hiding. Separable reversible data hiding is an improvised method in which there are two key players : The content owner and the data hider. The former encrypts the original image with an encryption key while the later exploits the spatial correlation of the natural image to create an additional space to accommodate data. At the receiver side, receiver having the data-hiding key, can extract the data but not the original image. At the same time, the receiver with the encryption key, can extract the image but not the data. If he has both the data-hiding and the encryption keys, he can extract the data and the original image content. The efficacy of this method can be enhanced if the keys too can be secured. This can be done using an efficient key-exchange algorithm like the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm. Also use of multiple encryption methods would make the system compatible with different applications. The system, in its working environment, would come across various actors with different privileges. In such a situation, having an authentication system would ensure that the data is received at the right hands. An authentication system and attack prevention measures, integrated along with the current version makes Separable Reversible data hiding a formidable method for data security.",AES; DES; Diffie hellman key exchange; Reversible data hiding; Separable reversible data hiding; Symmetric keys,Authentication; Image processing; Steganography; Authentication systems; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; Image steganography; Key exchange algorithms; Multiple securities; Reversible data hiding; Spatial correlations; Symmetric keys; Cryptography,"Mohan, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mar Baselios College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: meghamohan1992@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

A blood sample of the patient is spread over a glass slide, stained with Giemsa stain and examined under a microscope. It takes a few hours and a highly trained professional to visually examine the slide and give the results. It is even more difficult to detect the different types of malaria parasite and their stages by the conventional methods. The proposed method involves acquisition of the thin blood smear microscopic image at 100x magnification, pre-processing by partial contrast stretching, separation of infected cell from the image by applying k-means clustering on the a?b component of L?a?b color space, feature extraction (shape and textural) of the infected cell, feature reduction using one way ANOVA and finally training the K-nearest neighbor classifier to test the images. Instead of extracting features for the entire group of erythrocytes present in the image, the algorithm only processes the infected cells increasing the speed, effectiveness and efficiency of testing.

In this paper, we propose a method for the generation of high dynamic range image from a single input image using power law transformation. Power law transformation generates differently exposed images by varying the gamma value of the input image. Once the multiple exposure images are generated, they are fused together based on certain quality measures such as contrast, saturation, well exposedness etc. The result shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach which is verified qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2016 IEEE.",Contrast; High Dynamic Range; Power law transformation; Saturation; Well-exposedness,Computer networks; Information systems; Saturation (materials composition); Contrast; High dynamic range; High dynamic range images; High dynamic range imaging; High quality images; Image misalignment; Low dynamic range; Power-law; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Image restoration is done in two fields: spatial domain and frequency domain. In spatial domain the refining action for restoring the images is done by directly operating on the pixels of the digital image. Restoration adequacy was checked by taking peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and mean square error (MSE) into considerations. There are several approaches for image recognition. Among those approaches, application of soft computing models on digital image has been considered to be an approach with a better result.

The contrast of an image is increased by HE. But HE fails to produce satisfactory results for wide range of low contrast images, because HE does not use a spatial feature that is included in an original image. In order to overcome this disorder the differential gray-levels histogram equalization (DHE) has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the DHE to color image processing. Then, hue and intensity information are taken into account for color image enhancement. Hue component is used for intensity processing. Even by keeping the intensity constant we can capture the edge by changing the hue. First the processing is done with intensity component and then with hue component. Finally intensity and hue component results are combined to produce better results. The proposed method has one parameter which controls the enhancement property of the color image. The guideline for the decision of the parameter which is agreed by the human sense is also described. © 2016 IEEE.",color image processing; contrast enhancement; histogram equalization; hue; intensity,Color; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Image processing; Signal processing; Color image enhancement; Contrast Enhancement; Differential gray-levels histograms; Histogram equalizations; intensity; Intensity information; Low contrast image; Spatial features; Color image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The recognition rate of handwritten character is still limited due to the presence of large variety of shape, scale and format in hand written characters. A sophisticated handwritten character recognition system demands a better feature extraction technique that would take care of such variety of handwriting. The work proposed in this paper is an attempt to develop recognizer for Odia handwritten numeral digits based on Binarization and discrete cosine transform (DCT) scheme. The recognizer puts emphasis on exploiting the inherit characteristics of Odia numeral images. The system first employs the techniques like thinning, foreground and background noise removal, cropping and size normalization etc., to preprocess the character images. Binarization and DCT technique is employed separately to extract the features from the images. Subsequently, these feature vectors are sent to the neural network classifier. Extensive simulations show that the results are very promising over a standard dataset and the recognition rate for Binarization and DCT are 80.2% and 90%, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.",Back Propagation Algorithm; Binarization; Character Recognition (CR); Discrete cosine transform (DCT) Feature Extraction; Neural Network,Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Bins; Discrete cosine transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Neural networks; Binarizations; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Extensive simulations; Feature extraction techniques; Hand written character recognition; Hand-written characters; Handwritten numeral recognition; Neural network classifier; Character recognition,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

In order to overcome such problem a new Natural image based Visual Secret Sharing (NVSS) scheme was presented. Using NVSS scheme one can distribute a secret image using n-1 natural images and one noise image. It does not modify the contents of natural images. The encryption phase extracts features of every natural image. The secret image is converted to a share by performing computations on secret image and feature extracted from natural images. On the other hand the secret image is retrieved by performing computations on the share and the feature extracted from natural images. This scheme can be used to decrease the risk of transmission and also resolve the management problems. In our proposed system steganography is included to NVSS scheme to securely transfer data by hiding it behind the secret image. To increase the security further this secret data is encrypted before performing steganography. Hence the secret data is in encrypted format. This secret image is then converted into share which is finally embedded in cover image. This proposed scheme is able to share black and white, grey level or color images secretly. Also this scheme is easy to implement. © 2016 IEEE.",Data hiding; natural images; transmission risk; visual secret sharing,Cryptography; Discrete cosine transforms; Steganography; Color images; Data hiding; Image security; Management problems; Natural images; Risk of transmissions; Secret images; Visual secret sharing; Image processing,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Lack of technical competence, chance of electrocution is some of such issues. The cables/ wires of different instruments, measuring devises, rehabilitation systems are often the source of infection; causes of electrocution, discomfort and immobility. This has led to implement wireless technology/ system for medical applications. Accordingly researches are going on to use wireless technologies for different purposes of rehabilitation. The present work uses a wireless night vision camera for gaze tracking of the patient for 24×7 support eliminating the use of cables/ wires and thus reducing the chances of infections and other hazardous. The camera along with a power supply (battery) serves as a standalone unit for ready deployment. The control computer can be set up at a distance even out of the cabin and helps the physiotherapists and healthcare staffs to monitor and assist several patients remotely at a time. The experiments have been carried out in both day and night with users wearing spectacles or no spectacles. Promising results have been obtained in spite of several issues of data loss, IR glaring etc. Several applications of wireless technologies have been attempted, but use of such approach has never been tried earlier.

Unlike existing approaches that use content of handwriting for fraud/forged document identification, in this paper we propose a novel approach that explores the quality of handwritten documents by considering both foreground and background information to identify whether it is old or new. The proposed approach works based on the fact that if a fraud document is created with some gaps after the original one, the fraud document happened to be a new one and the original happened to be an old one in this work. To identify whether a given handwritten document is old or new with gaps, we propose to divide Fourier coefficients of the input image into positive and negative coefficient images, and then reconstruct respective images to conquer two reconstructed ones. The contrast of the reconstructed images obtained before and after divide-conquer is studied to analyze the ages of the document based on image quality. The proposed approach finds a unique relationship between reconstructed images, obtained before and after divide-conquer, to identify the input image as old or new. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on our own handwritten dataset and a standard database, namely, Google-LIFE magazine. Comparative studies with the existing approaches show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches in terms of classification rate. © 2016 IEEE.",Divide and conquer; Document aging; Forged document; Fourier coefficients; Fraud document,Character recognition; Crime; Fourier analysis; Fourier transforms; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Waveform analysis; Background information; Divide and conquer; Document identification; Forged document; Fourier coefficients; Fraud document; Handwritten document; Positive and negative coefficients; Information retrieval systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21676445,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Once Hyperspectral Image (HSI) has been acquired, a meaningful information can be obtained by further processing it. Processing of HSI must aim at achieving of given goals: Detect and classify the elementary materials for each pixel. Hyperspectral image classification is an active area to allocate distinct label to each pixel vector so that it is well defined by a given class. For classification of HSI, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is extensively used. To improve the classification accuracy, spectralspatial preprocessing technique called Multi hypothesis (MH) prediction has been used prior to SVM classifier. This processed HSI will results in less intraclass inconsistency compared to original image and it gives robust classification in the existence of noise. Major contribution of this work is an improvement of classification accuracy and to achieve it, a post processing step after classification has been applied.

It can be characterized by the gradual loss of articular cartilage. The knee OA- Affected bones slide together due to degradation of cartilage, causing joint pain, swelling, stiffness and eventual loss of motion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable non-invasive imaging modality to detect damages in cartilage, ligament and tendon which cannot be visualized using an x-ray. In the proposed work, the cartilage is segmented using pixel-based segmentation technique. Image processing techniques such as contrast enhancement, histogram equalization, thresholding and canny edge detection are implementedusing MATLAB R2013a (8.1) software on the MR images in 2D coronal view. Then a rough mask is created which undergoes morphological operations and the background noise is reduced. The segmented image undergoes GLCM feature extraction process. The texture features are calculated from the segmented image. The extracted GLCM features are given to the SVM classifier for classifying the image as normal and OA-affected. The accuracy was found to be 86.66% for the classification of the subject into normal and OA-affected.

Traditional canny edge detection algorithm uses frame based statistics which gives high accuracy but computationally more complex. Also canny algorithm is more sensitive to noise. In this experiment, an attempt is made to make canny algorithm more robust to noise using morphological filtering. Here canny algorithm is implemented at block level without any compromise in edge detection performance. If frame level statistics are used for threshold selection, it would result in either loss of edges or surplus edge detection. To solve this problem threshold selection is made based on type of block. Smooth and texture pixel counts are calculated for image block. Instead of using probability, actual pixel counts are used to calculate threshold. This makes threshold selection block more adaptive. Finally, objective analysis is carried out which shows proposed block based distributed algorithm is better than traditional frame based algorithm, especially in presence of impulse noise. © 2016 IEEE.",Block based image processing; Canny edge detector; Morphological filter; Simulink,Bandpass filters; Edge detection; Image processing; Pixels; Signal detection; Block based image processing; Canny edge detection; Canny edge detectors; Detection performance; Morphological filtering; Morphological filters; Simulink; Using probabilities; Impulse noise,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Therefore automatic image handling framework is required that can overcome related limitations in visual investigation which provide early detection of disease and also type of cancer. The proposed strategy is effectively connected to many numbers of pictures, demonstrating accurate results for changing image standard. Distinctive picture handling calculations, for example, Image enhancement, Clustering, Mathematical process and Labeling are executed utilizing MATLAB. Utilizing a portion of the productive image handling instruments we can recognize and section disease cell. The segmentation helps in knowing the precise size and shape of the cancer cell and the area. First we have utilized image enhancement strategies to improve the quality in terms of contrast and standardize the pixel values in the picture. After enhancement, segmentation is done to concentrate on area of interest; in this case it is nucleus. K-mean segmentation is used for segmentation. At that point we apply Feature extraction after that we have connected it to classifier to get the desired results as whether the cell is cancerous or not.

MRI has a time-consuming data collection process. CS is an emerging mathematical technique which enables us to reconstruct the image or signal from very few samples. Recently severe efforts are made to apply CS to MRI to speed up the acquisition process. Reducing the amount of data reduces the scan time which in turn reduces the time of exposition of patient to the magnetic fields. Various optimization algorithms are proposed for the reconstruction of MR images from small set of available data without compromising with the image quality.

This process is called co-registration. In this work we will discuss a three step procedure to prepare raw MRI data for co-registration. The primary requirement from the brain MR images is the extraction of the cortical surface of the brain. In order to perform cortical surface extraction, the acquired MR images are pre-processed to strip unwanted components, remove noise and avoid partial volume effect. This is achieved with the application of a skull stripping method based on hole-filling, dilation and erosion followed by anisotropic diffusion based filtering of the skull stripped images.

However, when copy-move forgery occurs, the second compression cycle is not always aligned w.r.t the first compression cycle. In such cases the misalignment factor in the horizontal and vertical directions need to be estimated which will be very useful for further blocks in the forensic analysis pipeline.

A local binary texture method, as a statistical approach, and a wavelet analysis technique, as a transform-based approach, are used for feature extraction and two feature vectors are obtained for every document image. The similarity distances between each of the two feature vectors extracted for a given query and the feature vectors extracted from the document images in the training step are computed separately. In order to use the properties of both features, a classifier fusion technique is then employed using a weighted average fusion of distance measures obtained in relation to each feature vector. The document images are finally ranked based on the greatest visual similarity to the query obtained from the fusion similarity measures. The Media Team Document Database, which provides a great variety of page layouts and contents, is considered for evaluating the proposed method. The results obtained from the experiments demonstrate a correct document retrieval of 65.4% and 91.8% in the Top-1 and Top-10 ranked document list, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.",Classifier fusion; Document image retrieval; Local binary pattern; Texture features; Wavelet transform,Binary images; Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Image classification; Image compression; Image fusion; Image processing; Image texture; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Query processing; Vectors; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Classification fusion; Classifier fusion; Document image retrieval; Document Retrieval; Local binary patterns; Similarity distance; Statistical approach; Texture features; Image retrieval,,Marsland S.Bailey D.Gupta G.S.,IEEE Computer Society,21512191,9.78151E+12,,,English,Int.

The sequence of the images is decomposed into different sub-bands with a dual tree discrete wavelet transform. We compute the DRAW map according to the appearance of the image based on features such as exposure, contrast and saturation.

Image fusion is the procedure to merges statistics from various images of the identical view. These pictures perhaps taken from various detectors, obtained at dissimilar times. In this paper, an image fusion technique rely on Directional Contourlet transform is proposed to improve the quality of image and meet the needs of application of vision. Two or more images to be fused should be decomposed using Contourlet with multi-resolution frequencies. The resulting sub-images are fused using Directive Contrast rule to obtain the combined image. As the wavelet transform has several special features in evaluation with scalar wavelets on image processing, but it flushes it to keep the inherent information. The efficacy of the proposed scheme has been explained using various image sets such as the multi-focus pictures, multi-detector satellite image.

The diagnostic accuracy can be limited by incompetence of the operating personnel, which can be supplemented by machine learning algorithms for classification of physiology and pathology. This paper uses effective information feature extraction, principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of multi-sequence MR images of 7 patients. All axial slices of the brain are classified into normal and abnormal images. Various methods for feature extraction were tested among which effective information yielded the highest accuracy of 80.8 in a set of 677 images used for training and testing. The sensitivity and specificity were 80 and 81.06, respectively. Different grid sizes were tested, and the highest accuracy was reported for 2 × 2 which indicates that the feature extraction must be taken over a small grid to ensure detection of minor variation from normal. The image sequences tested considered in the study are T1 weighted, T2 weighted, Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and post contrast T1 weighted. T2 weighted images were best classified with the maximum accuracy of 95.97. This method proved to be effective to classify the images of all four sequences with accuracy ranging from 92-96. The method was also tested with out of sample data and the accuracy obtained was 72.4. The novelty of this work lies in the classification of multi-sequential images using all the different slices of the patient which includes the top of the skull as well as the mandible. The slices differ significantly as the spread of the tumor varies with each slice. The slices are taken at 5mm gap and the tumor can have a thickness less or more than the slice gap considered for the scan. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Petrology is a specialty that deals with the understanding of the essential characteristics of the coal through appropriate chemical, morphological, or porosity analysis. Conventional analysis of coal by a petrologists is subjected to various shortcomings like inter-observer variations during screen analysis and due to different machine utilization, time consuming, highly skilled operator experience, and tiredness. In chemical analysis, use of conventional analyzers is expensive for characterization process. Thus, image analysis serves as an impressive automated characterization procedure of subtyping the coal, according to their textural, morphological, color, etc., features.

The background model maintained needs to be updated as and when moving objects add and leave the background. This paper proposes a redefined codebook model which aims at eliminating the ghost regions left behind when a non-permanent background object starts to move. The background codewords which were routinely deleted from the set of codewords in codebook model are retained in this method while deleting the foreground codewords leading to ghost elimination. This method also reduces memory requirements significantly without effecting object detection, as only the foreground codewords are deleted and not background. The method has been tested for robust detection on various videos with multiple and different kinds of moving backgrounds. Compared to existing multimode modeling techniques our algorithm eliminates the ghost regions left behind when non permanent background objects starts to move. For performance evaluation, we have used similarity measure on video sequences having dynamic backgrounds and compared with three widely used background subtraction algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Background subtraction; Motion analysis; Object detection; Video surveillance,Computer vision; Image processing; Motion analysis; Object recognition; Security systems; Background objects; Background subtraction; Background subtraction algorithms; Dynamic background; Memory requirements; Moving-object detection; Similarity measure; Video surveillance; Object detection,"Sharma, V.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: 2014pcp5168@mnit.ac.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

It minimizes the intraclass sparse reconstruction errors and maximizes the interclass reconstruction errors simultaneously. The above-mentioned steps have come under the training phase.

In the current work, we present a new technique for encrypting digital images based upon the pixel shuffling combined with changing pixel values using 128-bit secret key using henon chaotic map. Chaotic maps are characterized by their high sensitivity towards the initial parameters, which makes it a natural choice for developing a dynamic permutation matrix or as it is mostly called, permutation map. So we used chaotic Henon map in order to dynamically generate the permutation matrix. The initial parameters of the chaotic map and the secret key for changing the pixel values are derived from an external secret key. Horizontal and vertical permutations are used to perform pixel shuffling. Shuffling is used to destroy the correlation among the neighbour or adjacent image pixels, also it helps in increasing diffusion in the image. The proposed scheme is tested against a series of tests to measure its performance. Results of such tests indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive towards the encryption key and showed high resistance against various brute-force or statistical attacks. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

It is one of the most complex and demanding tasks in image processing. Image segmentation is the process of separating an image into various regions such that each region is identical. This paper proposes a new medical image segmentation method that integrates multi-resolution wavelet packet decomposition with the watershed transform for MRI image. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied to the input image, creating detail and approximation coefficients. If watershed technique alone is used for segmentation, then over cluster is present. To overcome this, the proposed technique which combines wavelet packet and watershed algorithm is developed. First, the wavelet packet transform is applied to produce multi-resolution images, followed by applying watershed for segmentation to the approximation sub-bands. Finally, Inverse WPT is implemented to obtain the segmented image. Due to wavelet packet decomposition, the quantity of the disturbance can be decreased and leads to a tough segmentation. This proposed work concludes that wavelet packet and watershed transform facilitate to get the elevated precision even in strident images. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Watershed algorithm; Wavelet packet transform,Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Watersheds; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Approximation coefficients; Hybrid segmentation; Multiresolution images; Multiresolution wavelets; Water-shed algorithm; Wavelet Packet Decomposition; Wavelet packet transform(WPT); Wavelet packet transforms; Image segmentation,"Rajmohan, K.; Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Annamalai UniversityIndia; email: ggtt_me@yahoo.com",Tyagi V.Grosky W.Gupta P.K.Oren T.Singh M.Sharma A.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

This paper attempts to model the degradation of ink-colour in documents. Such a model is not only helpful for determination of ink age and it gives a better insight about how colour of a document changes over time. The mathematical foundation for the proposed model is borrowed from an optimisation technique called ant colony optimisation. From a set of 200 documents distributed over five decades (30s to 70s decades) the model, under certain assumptions, tries to find an optimised path through which the majority of documents starting at 30s pass through intermediate decades to reach at 70s. Estimation of the model parameters and use of this model for: 1) determination of ink age; 2) prediction of a document's condition after certain years are discussed in details. Two types of digitised old magazines cover pages are considered for our experiment. The first one is used for construct the model and the second one is used for verification.

In this paper, color features have been exploited from each color component of an RGB color image by using multi-resolution approach since most of the information of an image is undetected at one resolution level while some other undetectable information is visualized in other multi-resolution levels. Initially, Gaussian image pyramid is employed on each color component of the color image and subsequent DCT is computed directly on the obtained multi-resolution image planes. Then some significant DCT coefficients are selected according to the zigzag scanning order. For formation of the feature vector, we have derived some statistical values from AC coefficients and all other DC coefficients are included entirely. Finally, a similarity measure is suggested during image retrieval process and it is found that the overall computation overhead is reduced due to consideration of the proposed similarity measure. The proposed CBIR scheme is validated on a two standard Corel-1K and GHIM-10K image databases and satisfactory results are achieved in terms of precision, recall and F-score. The retrieved results show that the proposed scheme outperforms significantly over other related CBIR schemes.",Content Based Image Retrieval; DCT; Feature Extraction; Gaussian Image Pyramid; Similarity Measure,Color; Content based retrieval; Discrete cosine transforms; Feature extraction; Image coding; Image compression; Image processing; Query processing; Computation overheads; Content based image retrieval; Discrete cosines; Gaussian image pyramid; Multi-resolution approach; Multiresolution images; Retrieval process; Similarity measure; Image retrieval,"Varish, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: naushad.cs88@gmail.com",,IOS Press,1692968,,FUINE,,English,Fundam Inf,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032706425

Finger print identification refers to the automated system of verifying a match between two human finger prints. This research aims at extracting the primary uniqueness of the images obtained from the finger print. A finger print constitutes of a series of grooves/ridges on the surface of the finger. The uniqueness of a finger print can be determined by these patterns. Minutiae points are local groove characteristics that occur at either a groove bifurcation or a groove ending. Here an approach of identification of minutia in terms of ending, bifurcation, and region of interest (ROI) has been proposed. Extraction of minutiae from the image is attained using termination and bifurcation process and then elimination of false minutia is done from the image using the distance formula.

Technological advancements enable criminal actors to perpetrate innovative frauds that are very difficult to detect. One example is the use of erasable ink that allows alterations to be made to a bank check without raising suspicion. Another example is the misuse of a victim’s handwritten signature by scanning it and then printing on a check. Since most banking systems accept scanned copies of checks for clearance, identifying erasable ink alterations and printed signatures on digital images can be very challenging. This chapter describes automated, low-cost, efficient and scalable solutions to these problems. A solution is proposed for determining whether or not a check is genuine or merely printed. A solution for detecting erasable ink alterations localizes the erased regions in the visible light spectrum. A solution for detecting printed signatures focuses on the high-density noise introduced by scanners and printers. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.",Bank check fraud; Check alteration; Check forgery; Image processing,Crime; Electronic crime countermeasures; Image processing; Bank checks; Banking systems; Check alteration; Check forgery; Handwritten signatures; Scalable solution; Technological advancement; Visible light; Digital forensics,"Gupta, G.; Ministry of Information TechnologyIndia; email: gauravg@iiitd.ac.in",Peterson G.Shenoi S.,Springer New York LLC,18684238,9.78332E+12,,,English,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029423813

There are several examples of such types of motions. In ships, sloshing motion occur in oil tankers, liquefied natural gas carriers and large fuel oil tanks. In case of rockets, it happens in the liquid hydrogen (LOH) and liquid oxygen (LOX) containing external fuel tanks. The sloshing motion is mainly due to large dimensions of tanks with smooth plane surfaces in contact with the liquid. The tank layout fails to damp the sloshing motion of the liquid. The sloshing motion becomes more violent when the parent vehicle’s motion contains energy in the vicinity of the natural frequencies for liquid motion inside the tank. Determination of these frequencies is critical to determine the nature of fluid motion inside the tank and thereby predict impact load on the structure holding the liquid. The determination of hydrodynamic pressure on the tank walls due to liquid sloshing motion finds application in the design and construction of liquid tanks in rockets and ships. In some cases, determination of liquid motion inside the tank is also critical as it can get coupled with the parent vehicle’s motion dynamics. This paper deals with extraction of data from video recording of liquid sloshing motion inside a rectangular tank. Image processing techniques are used for this purpose. The important fluid dynamics properties which can be determined by image processing are discussed in the paper. The analysis presented is mainly for 2D motions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Image processing; Photogrammetry; Sloshing,Automobile fuel tanks; Fluid dynamics; Fluids; Fuel sloshing; Fuel tanks; Image analysis; Image processing; Liquefied gases; Liquids; Oil tankers; Oil tanks; Photogrammetry; Rockets; Ships; Tanks (containers); Video recording; Design and construction; External fuel tanks; Hydrodynamic pressure; Image processing technique; Large dimensions; Liquefied natural gas carriers; Liquid hydrogens; Rectangular tank; Liquid sloshing,"Kamilla, R.; Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: rahulkam3009@gmail.com",Cheriet F.Karray F.Campilho A.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Commercially available depth cameras capture depth images at a very low-resolution as compared to that of the optical cameras. Having an highresolution depth camera is expensive because of the manufacturing cost of the depth sensor element. In many applications like robot navigation, human-machine interaction (HMI), surveillance, 3D viewing, etc. where depth images are used, the LR images from the depth cameras will restrict these applications, thus there is a need of a method to produce HR depth images from the available LR depth images. This paper addresses this issue using DWT method. This paper also contributes to the compilation of the existing methods for depth image super-resolution with their advantages and disadvantages, along with a proposed method to super-resolve depth image using DWT. Haar basis for DWT has been used as it has an intrinsic relationship with super-resolution (SR) for retaining the edges.

The encryption algorithm involves pixel breakup into two parts and reversing parts of the pixel. The results show a deviation of pixel between the images present in the original and encrypted domains. The decryption algorithm is exactly the encryption algorithm in reverse.

This paper presents a framework for hyperspectral image segmentation using a clustering algorithm. The framework consists of four stages in segmenting a hyperspectral data set. In the first stage, filtering is done to remove noise in image bands. Second stage consists of dimensionality reduction algorithms, in which the bands that convey less information or redundant data will be removed. In the third stage, the informative bands which are selected in the second stage are merged into a single image using hierarchical fusion technique. In the hierarchical image fusion, the images are grouped such that each group has equal number of images. This methodology leads to group of images having much varied information, thus decreasing the quality of fused image. This paper presents a new methodology of hierarchical image fusion in which similarity metrics are used to create image groups for merging the selected image bands.

It is always recommendable for a denoising method to preserve important image features, such as edges, corners, etc., during its execution. Image denoising methods based on wavelet transforms have been shown their excellence in providing an efficient edge-preserving image denoising, because they provide a suitable basis for separating noisy signal from the image signal. This paper presents a novel edge-preserving image denoising technique based on wavelet transforms. The wavelet domain representation of the noisy image is obtained through its multi-level decomposition into wavelet coefficients by applying a discrete wavelet transform. A patch-based weighted-SVD filtering technique is used to effectively reduce noise while preserving important features of the original image. Experimental results, compared to other approaches, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves very impressive gain in denoising performance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Adaptive filtering; Edge detection; Singular value decomposition (SVD); Wavelet transform,Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Computer vision; Discrete wavelet transforms; Edge detection; Image compression; Image processing; Signal denoising; Singular value decomposition; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; De-noising techniques; Denoising methods; Filtering technique; Image denoising methods; Image processing and computer vision; Important features; Standard problems; Wavelet coefficients; Image denoising,"Tyagi, V.; Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology, Raghogarh, India; email: dr.vipin.tyagi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009495785

The proposed model makes use of global features of logo images such as color, texture, and shape features for classification. The logo images are broadly classified into three different classes, viz., logo image containing only text, an image with only symbol, and an image with both text and a symbol. In each class, the similar looking logo images are clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The intra-cluster variations present in each cluster corresponding to each class are then preserved using symbolic interval data. Thus referenced logo images are represented in the form of interval data. A sample logo image is then classified using suitable symbolic classifier. For experimentation purpose, relatively large amount of color logo images is created consisting of 5044 logo images. The classification results are validated with the help of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and time. To check the efficacy of the proposed model, the comparative analyses are given against the other models.

While the principal reason behind this interest is the wide range of applications of these surfaces; adhesion and wetting studies also have turned into important areas of research. This is especially important in applications such as biomimetic surfaces, lab-on-chip devices, etc. The study of the contact angle and surface energy is therefore both interesting and crucial. In this paper, an attempt is made to compute the contact angle of various substrates using four different methods. Apart from the traditional half angle method and goniometry which are quite well-known, image processing methods based on curve fitting and Hough transforms which have been developed by the authors have been considered for this comparative analysis. In this paper, the Hough transforms-based technique has been discussed in detail. While it is difficult to declare any one technique as the universally best, the pros and cons of all the four algorithms have been discussed in the results section.

There is a huge need for algorithms that generalize using raw sensory inputs, such as vision, without any hand-engineered features or domain heuristics. In this paper, the standard control problem of line following robot was used as a test-bed, and an ANN controller for the robot was trained on images from a live video feed using Q-learning. A virtual agent was first trained in simulation environment and then deployed onto a robot's hardware.

The method does not involve pixel expansion and image recovery is lossless. However, use of Hill Cipher requires a2 × 2integermatrixwhose inverse should also be an integer matrix. Further, to extend the method for multi-secret sharing, one requires higher order integer matrices. This needs heavy computation and the choice of matrices is also very restricted, due to integer entry constraints. In the present paper we introduce an RG-based Visual Secret Sharing Scheme (VSS) scheme using image interleaving and affine cipher. Combined effect of image interleaving and affine transformation helps in improving the security of the secret images. Parameters of the affine cipher serve as keys and the random grid and encrypted image form the shares. No one can reveal the secret unless the keys and both the shares are known. Further, as opposed to the method in [1], the present scheme does not require invertible matrix with integer inverse. The scheme is also extended for multi-secret sharing. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Affine cipher; Image interleaving; Pixel correlation,Computer vision; Cryptography; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Pixels; Affine ciphers; Affine transformations; Encrypted images; Image interleaving; Integer matrices; Invertible matrices; Multi-secret sharing; Visual secret sharing schemes; Image processing,"Kaur, H.; PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and ManufacturingIndia; email: harkeerat.kaur@iiitdmj.ac.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

As the window characteristics depends upon the type of the function and length of window used, hence, this is necessary to choose a particular window function and window length depending upon the applications. In other hand, real-time implementation of window function demands efficient and flexible very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) architecture. Hence, this paper presents a new hardware efficient coordinate-rotation-digital-computer (CORDIC)-based VLSI architecture which is capable of reconfigurability to choose a window function among aforesaid popular window functions and window length ranging from 8 to 32 K (215), depending upon the application.

Using a training set of labeled instances, the task is to build a model (classifier) that can be used to predict the class of new unlabelled instances. Data preparation is crucial to the data mining process, and its focus is to improve the fitness of the training data for the learning algorithms to produce more effective classifiers. Searching for the frequent pattern within a specific sequence has become a much needed task in various sectors. Feature selection is selecting a subset of optimal features. Feature selection is being used in high dimensional data reduction and it is being used in several applications like medical, image processing, text mining, etc. In the existing work, unsupervised feature selection methods using Artificial Bee Colony Optimization Algorithm, Bat Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization have been introduced. We have compared these three algorithms and concluded that Bat Algorithm proves to be better in performance than the rest.

There are many existing techniques to detect image tampering but their computational complexity is high. Here we present a robust and effective technique to find the tampered region. Initially the given image is divided into fixed size blocks and DCT is applied on each block for feature extraction. Circle is used to represent each transformed block with two feature vectors. In this way we reduce the dimension of the blocks to extract the feature vectors. Then lexicographical sort is applied to sort the extracted feature vectors. Matching algorithm is applied to detect the tampered regions.

Chronic wounds are a global, ongoing health challenge that afflicts a large number of people. Effective diagnosis and treatment of the wounds relies largely on a precise identification and measurement of the wounded tissue; however, in current clinical process, wound evaluation is based on subjective visual inspection and manual measurements which are often inaccurate. Given the cost and inconvenience of regular visits to wound clinics and for providing real time aid/care to remote and rural areas smart phone app named, Wound Vision which tracks/identifies the wound size, healing/management process based on images captured/processed within a smart phone is designed. Therefore this automated mobile-based system for fast and accurate segmentation and identification of wounds is desirable, both from the standpoint of improving health outcomes in chronic wound care, and in making clinical practice efficient and cost-effective for people in remote areas and cities. Satisfactory results of this real time mobile system suggest a promising tool to assist in the field of clinical wound evaluation. The simplicity of the algorithm/framework used suggests that it is a valuable tool in clinical wound evaluation. Future work will incorporate additional features (wound Tissue analysis-necrotic, fibrin & granulation tissue) for assessing the wound healing process in order to completely replace clinical praxis.

Due to the lack of expert radiologists, it is difficult to interpret the mammogram images. In this paper an algorithm is proposed for a computer-aided diagnosis system, which is based on the wavelet based adaptive sigmoid function. The cascade feed-forward back propagation technique has been used for training and testing purposes. Due to the poor contrast in digital mammogram images it is difficult to process the images directly. Thus, the images were first processed using the wavelet based adaptive sigmoid function and then the suspicious regions were selected to extract the features. A combination of texture features and graylevel co-occurrence matrix features were extracted and used for training and testing purposes. The system was trained with 150 images, while a total 100 mammogram images were used for testing. A classification accuracy of more than 95% was obtained with our proposed method. © 2017 KIPS.",Cascade-forward back propagation technique; Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD); Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE); Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM); Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database; Modified sigmoid function,Backpropagation; Calcification (biochemistry); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Mammography; Wavelet analysis; X ray screens; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE); Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Mammographic image analysis; Sigmoid function; Image processing,"Chandra, M.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: shrotriya69@rediffmail.com",,Korea Information Processing Society,1976913X,,,,English,J.

In this work, we address the problem of segmentation from medical images. Segmentation or object delineation from medical images/volumes is a fundamental step for subsequent quantification tasks key to diagnosis. Semantic segmentation has been popularly addressed using FCN (e.g. U-NET) with impressive results and has been the fore runner in recent segmentation challenges. However, there are a few drawbacks of FCN approaches which recent works have tried to address. Firstly, local geometry such as smoothness and shape are not reliably captured. Secondly, spatial context captured by FCNs while giving the advantage of a richer representation carries the intrinsic drawback of overfitting, and is quite sensitive to appearance and shape changes. To handle above issues, in this work, we propose a hybrid of generative modeling of image formation to jointly learn the triad of foreground (F), background (B) and shape (S). Such generative modeling of F, B, S would carry the advantages of FCN in capturing contexts. Further we expect the approach to be useful under limited training data, results easy to interpret, and enable easy transfer of learning across segmentation problems. We present ~8% improvement over state of art FCN approaches for US kidney segmentation and while achieving comparable results on CT lung nodule segmentation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Semantics; Convolutional networks; Generative model; Kidney segmentation; Limited training data; Object delineation; Prediction problem; Semantic segmentation; Transfer of learning; Medical image processing,"Ravishankar, H.; GE Global ResearchIndia; email: hariharan.ravishankar@ge.com",Zhu H.Niethammer M.Styner M.Zhu H.Shen D.Yap P.-T.Aylward S.Oguz I.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In recent years, a variety of CAD system has been proposed for the detection of leukemia. Acute leukemia is a malignant neoplastic disorder that influences a larger fraction of world population. In modern medical science, there are sufficient newly formulated methodologies for the early detection of leukemia. Such advanced technologies include medical image processing methods for the detection of the syndrome. This paper shows that use of a highly appropriate feature extraction technique is required for the classification of a disease. In the field of image processing and machine learning approach, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a well-known technique. Nucleus features are extracted from the RGB image.

We consider three rice plant diseases namely Bacterial leaf blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut. We capture images of infected rice plants using a digital camera from a rice field. We empirically evaluate four techniques of background removal and three techniques of segmentation. To enable accurate extraction of features, we propose centroid feeding based K-means clustering for segmentation of disease portion from a leaf image.We enhance the output of K-means clustering by removing green pixels in the disease portion.We extract various features under three categories: color, shape, and texture.We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) for multi-class classification.We achieve 93.33% accuracy on training dataset and 73.33% accuracy on the test dataset.

This assists forensic analysts to map a suspect’s camera with a possibly illegal image repository, or to attribute an image under question to its legitimate source. Counter–forensic attacks to Camera Model Identification techniques, primarily comprise of image anonymization. Image Anonymization is a technique adopted by an intelligent adversary for modifying an image illegitimately, so as to disable attribution of the image to its source; hence to fool a forensic analyst and prevent image source identification. In the recent years, there has been a rapid growth of research interest in the domain of counter–forensics. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether an image under question has undergone any form of counter–forensic source anonymization attack. This will enable a forensic analyst to find out whether an image, whose source is being investigated, is authentic, or has it been tampered so as to prevent correct source identification. We deal with three major classes of source anonymization attacks in this paper, viz., Seam Carving, Fingerprint Copying, and Adaptive PRNU Denoising. If an image is detected to have indeed undergone a counter–forensic attack, the proposed model additionally enables detection of the specific class of attack, through multiclass classification.

However, there is a performance degradation with palmprint biometrics because of the failure of extracting genuine minutia points from the region of highly distorted ridge information with huge data. In this paper, we propose an efficient palmprint matching algorithm using nearest neighbor minutiae quadruplets. The representation of minutia points in the form of quadruplets improves the matching accuracy at nearest neighbors by discarding scope of the global matching on false minutia points. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available high resolution palmprint standard databases, namely, palmprint benchmark data sets (FVC ongoing) and Tsinghua palmprint database (THUPALMLAB).

Widespread usage of camera traps has led to large volumes of collected images, making manual processing of visual content hard to manage. In this work, we develop a framework for automatic detection and recognition of individuals in different patterned species like tigers, zebras and jaguars. Most existing systems primarily rely on manual input for localizing the animal, which does not scale well to large datasets. In order to automate the detection process while retaining robustness to blur, partial occlusion, illumination and pose variations, we use the recently proposed Faster-RCNN object detection framework to efficiently detect animals in images. We further extract features from AlexNet of the animal’s flank and train a logistic regression (or Linear SVM) classifier to recognize the individuals. We primarily test and evaluate our framework on a camera trap tiger image dataset that contains images that vary in overall image quality, animal pose, scale and lighting. We also evaluate our recognition system on zebra and jaguar images to show generalization to other patterned species. Our framework gives perfect detection results in camera trapped tiger images and a similar or better individual recognition performance when compared with state-of-the-art recognition techniques. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Animal biometrics; Computer vision; Convolutional neural network; Detection; Recognition; Wildlife monitoring,Animals; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Cameras; Computer vision; Cost effectiveness; Error detection; Learning systems; Neural networks; Object detection; Quality control; Statistical tests; Automatic Detection; Convolutional neural network; Cost-effective approach; Individual recognition; Logistic regressions; Recognition; Recognition systems; Wildlife monitoring; Image processing,"Cheema, G.S.; IIIT-DelhiIndia; email: gullal1408@iiitd.ac.in",Ceci M.Dzeroski S.Malerba D.Altun Y.Das K.Read J.Zitnik M.Stefanowski J.Mielikainen T.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In the embedding process, the host colour image is decomposed into third-level DWT. Low frequency band (LL3) is transformed by SVD. The watermark image is also transformed by SVD. The S vector of watermark information is embedded in the S component of the host image. Watermarked image is generated by inverse SVD on modified S vector and original U, V vectors followed by inverse DWT. Watermark is extracted using an extraction algorithm. In order to enhance the robustness performance of the image watermark, back propagation neural network (BPNN) is applied to the extracted watermark to reduce the effects of different noise applied on the watermarked image. Results are obtained by varying the gain factor and size of the cover and watermark image, experimental results are provided to illustrate that the proposed method is able to withstand a variety of signal processing attacks and has been found to be giving superior performance for robustness and imperceptibility compared to existing methods suggested by other authors. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Back propagation neural network; BPNN; Discrete wavelet transform; DWT; Image watermarking; NC; Normalised correlation; Singular value decomposition; Social applications; SVD,Backpropagation; Digital watermarking; Frequency bands; Image processing; Image watermarking; Inverse problems; Neural networks; Signal processing; Singular value decomposition; Social aspects; Torsional stress; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Back propagation neural networks; BPNN; Extraction algorithms; Low frequency band; Robust watermarking; Security protection; Social applications; Watermark information; Discrete wavelet transforms,"Singh, A.K.; Information TechnologyIndia; email: amit_245singh@yahoo.com",,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,17441765,,,,English,Int.

In this model, an intelligent method is applied to raw image to locate the regions with extreme visibility difference. The ring specific geographical mapping is applied to locate these regions. Three blocks from the region are evaluated based on visibility, entropy and frequency parameters. The comparative evaluation on block content strength is applied to get the referenced block blocks with maximum containment. Finally, each region block is mapped to this reference block to stabilize the contrast unbalancing. The proposed method is applied in real time captured images with different lighting effects.

A method of converting an imbalanced text corpus into a balanced one is presented. The presented method employs a clustering algorithm for conversion. Initially to avoid curse of dimensionality, an effective representation scheme based on term class relevancy measure is adapted, which drastically reduces the dimension to the number of classes in the corpus. Subsequently, the samples of larger sized classes are grouped into a number of subclasses of smaller sizes to make the entire corpus balanced. Each subclass is then given a single symbolic vector representation by the use of interval valued features. This symbolic representation in addition to being compact helps in reducing the space requirement and also the classification time. The proposed model has been empirically demonstrated for its superiority on bench marking datasets viz., Reuters 21578 and TDT2. Further, it has been compared against several other existing contemporary models including model based on support vector machine.

However, after extracting the secret data some of the image information gets lost. It is an important issue to have a data hiding scheme which can extract the secret data as well as can restore the original image without any loss of information. Such types of schemes are called reversible data hiding schemes which are commonly used in sensitive military, legal, and medical applications. The existing reversible data hiding schemes either provide good hiding capacity but inferior stego-image quality or good stego-image quality but poor hiding capacity because the stego-image quality and the hiding capacity are diametrically related parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel high capacity reversible data hiding scheme which has high data hiding capacity while maintaining good quality stego-image. In this scheme, we first cryptographically encode the secret data using a private key so that even if an attacker is able to extract the embedded secret data, he cannot get the original secret message unless he has the private key. Our scheme hides the secret data in two phases. In first phase, it uniformly divides the pixel intensity levels i.e., 0-255, into odd sized segments. Then the image is scanned in zigzag order to identify the concealable pixels, which have the same value as the middle elements of a segment. Some of the secret data is hidden into these identified pixels. In second phase, the intensity levels are again divided in reverse order, i.e., 255 to 0, into odd sized segments of uniform length like as in the first phase. The resultant image is again scanned in zigzag order and concealable pixels are identified. The remaining secret data is embedded into the concealable pixels. To ensure reversibility of our algorithm, a location map is maintained for each phase. The location maps are compressed using JBIG1 scheme and are transmitted through a secure channel along with other auxiliary information that contains private key and segment size. Experimentally our scheme achieves very high capacity without deteriorating the image quality. It is because we select the exact middle pixels of the segments to hide the secret data, which ensures that the pixel value does not get altered unevenly while embedding the secret data. It further helps in increasing the hiding capacity. Moreover, it is very simple as it does not require much computation for embedding the secret data. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Concealable pixel; Pixel mapping function; Reversible data hiding,Image quality; Image segmentation; Medical applications; Military applications; Pixels; Steganography; Auxiliary information; Data hiding capacity; Image information; Intensity levels; Pixel intensities; Pixel mapping; Reversible data hiding; Secure channels; Image processing,"Kumar, R.; Division of Computer Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: rajivgarg@outlook.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948425343

Tracking of moving object in a video becomes difficult due to random motion of objects. This paper introduces a new algorithm for moving object tracking by exploiting the properties of Daubechies complex wavelet transform and Zernike moment. The proposed method uses combination of Daubechies complex wavelet transform and Zernike moment as a feature of object. The motivation behind using combination of these two as a feature of object, because shift invariance and better edge representation property make Daubechies complex wavelet transform suitable for locating object in consecutive frames whereas rotation invariance properties of Zernike moment is also helpful for correct object identification in consecutive frames. Therefore combination of these two as feature of object gives better results. The proposed method matches Zernike moments of Daubechies complex wavelet coefficients of object in the first frame to next consecutive frames.

The two input mages are first phase encoded and each of them are then multiplied with SPMs and Fresnel propagated with distances d1 and d2, respectively. The single-level discrete WT is applied to Fresnel propagated complex images to decompose each into sub-band matrices i.e. LL, HL, LH and HH. Further, the sub-band matrices of two complex images are interchanged after modulation with random phase masks (RPMs) and subjected to inverse discrete WT. The resulting images are then both added and subtracted to get intermediate images which are further Fresnel propagated with distances d3 and d4, respectively. These outputs are finally gyrator transformed with the same angle ? to get the encrypted images. The proposed technique provides enhanced security in terms of a large set of security keys. The sensitivity of security keys such as SPM parameters, GT angle ?, Fresnel propagation distances are investigated.

Steganography is defined as the process of concealing the data or message within media files without affecting the perception of the image. Media files, like audio, video, image, etc., are utilized to embed the message. Nowadays, steganography is also used to transmit the medical information or diagnostic reports. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the novel wavelet transform-based steganographic method is proposed for secure data communication using OFDM system. The embedding and extraction process in the proposed steganography method exploits the wavelet transform. Initially, the cost matrix is estimated by the following three aspects: pixel intensity, edge transformation and wavelet transform. The cost estimation matrix provides the location of the cover image where the message is to be entrenched. Then, the wavelet transform is utilized to embed the message into the cover image according to the cost value. Subsequently, in the extraction process, the wavelet transform is applied to the embedded image to retrieve the message efficiently. Finally, in order to transfer the secret information over the channel, the newly developed wavelet-based steganographic method is employed for the OFDM system. Findings: The experimental results are evaluated and performance is analyzed using PSNR and MSE parameters and then compared with existing systems. Thus, the outcome of our wavelet transform steganographic method achieves the PSNR of 71.5 dB which ensures the high imperceptibility of the image. Then, the outcome of the OFDM-based proposed steganographic method attains the higher PSNR of 71.07 dB that proves the confidentiality of the message. Originality/value: In the authors’ previous work, the embedding and extraction process was done based on the cost estimation matrix. To enhance the security throughout the communication system, the novel wavelet-based embedding and extraction process is applied to the OFDM system in this paper.

Extracted features represent the descriptive nature of the imaging modality for machine learning. Texture description, is one such method which is used to extract the informative aspect of the object. In this paper a new texture based feature extraction algorithm is proposed for extracting relevant and informative features from brain MR Images having tumor. Suggested algorithm is based on finding the texture description using nine different variants of texture objects. Subsequently, the intermediate texture index matrix is formed using texture objects with high pass and low pass spiral filters. The resultant two index matrix are used to generate the Texture Co-occurrence Matrix (TOM). TOM helps to extract the spatial and spectral domain features that forms the hybrid feature set for brain MRI classification. Using TOM, an experimentation is performed with a dataset of 660 T1-weighted post contrast brain MR Images having 5 different types of malignant tumors. Experimental results suggest that proposed method gives significant results in abnormality classification when compared with state-of-art GLCM and Run length algorithms. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Computer Aided Detection of Tuberculosis is an important possibility for the world due to the mismatch in the incidences of this disease with the number of trained human readers for its identification. In this paper, we propose novel features for the detection of one of the symptoms observed in cases of TB, Pleural Effusion (PE). We begin by segmenting the lung regions, followed by creation of a novel feature set. We achieve an ROC of 0.961 on discriminating PE against Chest X-Rays (CXRs) without incidences of TB. To validate that our system discriminates against PE, we achieve an ROC of 0.864 against CXRs showing incidences of TB but a lack of PE. These features are then tested on two publicly available datasets (One collected from the United States, and the other from China). Due to the lack of other work for detection of PE on these datasets, a direct comparison is unfortunately not possible. However, the results obtained surpass those of work on PE detection on other private datasets. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Computer aided diagnosis; Pleural Effusion; Tuberculosis,Biological organs; Diagnosis; Image analysis; Image processing; Chest radiographs; Chest x-rays; Computer aided detection; Feature sets; Human readers; Lung regions; Pleural effusion; Tuberculosis; Computer aided diagnosis,"Sharma, U.; Indian Institute of Technology DelhiIndia; email: ee5120562@ee.iitd.ac.in",Schettini R.Battiato S.Gallo G.Stanco F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Lightning is associated with every thunderstorm, which kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes. Heavy rain from thunderstorm causes extensive loss of property and leads to flooding. Accurate prediction of thunderstorm is a difficult task in weather forecasting due to its temporal extension and spatial either physically or dynamically.

This chapter deals with the image processing and attempts have been taken to illustrate the intertwining among mind, machine and image processing. Further, different subtle aspects pertaining to mind and intelligence are also presented. In fact, intelligence acts as a substrate of mind to engage it in consciousness. Indeed, mind is distinct from the consciousness and both are subtler than the body. The chapter also elucidates the comparison of mind machine, and intelligence in image processing. Moreover, attempt has been made to envision the core issues related to different aspects like: (1) intelligence is the means to engage the mind in consciousness (2) Brain is analogous to a feed forward hierarchical state machine and acts as a substrate for mind and possesses vital relationship with intelligence. Indeed, there are two important approaches to develop an artificially intelligent device. These are the conceptual understanding of mind and the computational framework of brain. This chapter emphasizes that the agent in which embryonic artificial intelligence is to be created must have the capacity of embodied experience and it must possess sensory components to establish relations between it and the external world. Further, this chapter also renders the philosophical perspectives of some intuitive questions such as: Can mind be explained in terms of machines? Can mind be replicated on machines? Do machines can ever be intelligent? In fact mind or intelligence cannot be reflected by physical means. In addition, this chapter preludes that mainly there are two approaches pertinent to the philosophy of mind. These are the dualism and functionalism. However, it is hard to explain the true nature of mind with the help of only these two approaches because mind displays the characteristics like and dislikes a machine simultaneously. Moreover, the concept of machine seems to be based on dichotomy between these two approaches.

It plays a major role in the metabolic rates of our body, either it can get lower or higher. The pituitary gland is the centre for the secretion of thyroid hormone. So if any fluctuation occurs in this particular gland the hormone changes can arise and that will result to many sorts of abnormalities in our body. The general procedure used for the detection of thyroid is through invasive blood test. The aim of this study is to compare the existing biomarker with the imaging modality for the early stage diagnosis of thyroid disorder. A total of 63 subjects participated in this study. Various biochemicals, physical and physiological parameters were obtained. Thermal images from head to toe were obtained for all the subjects. Further, the images were processed using MATLAB Tool and ANN classifier. Among the study population, 37 were control and 26 were thyroid affected based on biochemical results. The classifier provided an accuracy of 98.4%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.3%. Thus, thermography with the help of image processing can be used as screening tool for early diagnosis of thyroid disorder. © 2017 IEEE.",AAA classifier; Infrared thermography; Matlab; Segmentation; Thyroid disorder,Diagnosis; Image processing; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Physiological models; Physiology; Early diagnosis; Early-stage diagnosis; Imaging modality; Metabolic rates; Physiological parameters; Pituitary gland; Thyroid disorders; Thyroid hormones; Thermography (imaging),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,English,"Proc.

Using contextual information and probabilistic inference mechanisms is a recent trend in this direction. The proposed method is an improved version of the Spatio-Temporal Compositions (STC) concept, introduced earlier. Specific modifications are applied to STC method to reduce time complexity and improve the performance. The non-overlapping volume and ensemble formation employed reduce the iterations in codebook construction and probabilistic modeling steps. A simpler procedure for codebook construction has been proposed. A non-parametric probabilistic model and adaptive inference mechanisms to avoid the use of a single experimental threshold value are the other contributions. An additional feature such as event-driven high-resolution localization of unusual events is incorporated to aid in surveillance application.

High variability of target signature and low contrast ratio of targets to background makes the task of target recognition in infrared images challenging, demanding robust adaptable methods capable of capturing these variations. As opposed to the traditional shallow learning approaches which rely on hand engineered feature extraction, deep learning based approaches use environmental knowledge to learn and extract the features automatically. We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework for automatic recognition of civilian targets in infrared images. The performance evaluation is carried on infrared target clips obtained from ‘CSIR-CSIO moving object thermal infrared imagery dataset’. The task involves four categories classification one category representing the background and three categories of targets -ambassador, auto and pedestrians. The proposed CNN framework provides classification accuracy of 88.15% with all four categories and 98.24% with only three target categories. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Target recognition; Thermal infrared imaging,Computer vision; Convolution; Feature extraction; Infrared imaging; Infrared radiation; Neural networks; Thermography (imaging); Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Environmental knowledge; Target recognition; Thermal infrared imagery; Thermal infrared images; Thermal infrared imaging; Image processing,"Akula, A.; CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIR-CSIO)India; email: aparna.akula@csio.res.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The work presented in this paper focuses on image decolorization and classification as two stages. The first stage or objective of this paper is to improve the performance of the color scene classification system using deep belief networks (DBN) and support vector machines (SVM). Therefore, color scene classification system termed as AGMM-DBN-SVM is proposed using the existing feature extraction technique called bags of visual words (BoW) derived from the dense scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and adapted Gaussian mixture models (AGMM). The second stage of the presented work is to combine the proposed AGMM-DBN-SVM classification models obtained for the two different image decolorization methods called rgb2gray and singular value decomposition (SVD) based color-To-grayscale image mapping techniques to significantly increase the performance of the proposed color scene classification system. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is experimented on Oliva Torralba (OT) scene dataset containing 8 different classes. The classification rate of the proposed color scene classification system applied on OT 8 scene dataset is significantly greater than the one of the existing benchmarks color scene classification system developed using AGMM and SVM. © 2017 IEEE.",,Color; Color image processing; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machines; Classification rates; Decolorization methods; Deep belief network (DBN); Deep belief networks; Feature extraction and classification; Feature extraction techniques; Gaussian Mixture Model; Scale invariant feature transforms; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows for the simultaneous fill-in of different structures and textures by processing in a wavelet domain. A combination of structure inpainting and patch-based texture synthesis is carried out, which is known as patch-based inpainting, for filling and updating the target region. The wavelet transform is used for its very good multiresolution capabilities. The proposed algorithm uses the wavelet domain subbands to resolve the structure and texture components in smooth approximation and high frequency structural details. The subbands are processed separately by the prioritized patch-based inpainting with isophote energy driven texture synthesis at the core. The algorithm automatically estimates the wavelet coefficients of the target regions of various subbands using optimized patches from the surrounding DWT coefficients. The suggested performance improvement drastically improves execution speed over the existing algorithm. The proposed patch optimization strategy improves the quality of the fill. The fill-in is done with higher priority to structures and isophotes arriving at target boundaries. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated with natural and textured images with varying textural complexions. © 2017 KIPS.",Image inpainting; Object removal; Region filling; Texture and structure propagation; Wavelet inpainting,Approximation algorithms; Computer graphics; Image processing; Image texture; Optimization; Restoration; Wavelet transforms; Image Inpainting; Inpainting; Multiresolution capability; Object removal; Optimization strategy; Patch-based texture synthesis; Region filling; Wavelet coefficients; Image reconstruction,"Borole, R.P.; Dept. of Electronics and Telecom, Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: rpborole@yahoo.com",,Korea Information Processing Society,1976913X,,,,English,J.

In the recent times, village streets have been illuminated with artificial lights as a part of rural development drive undertaken by the governments of respective countries. But, vehicle and pedestrian traffic is quite low through village roads. Hence, if light remains on all night long on such roads, then there is a huge wastage of energy. This calls for solutions to reduce this energy loss in an efficient manner. There are a lot of factors which must be kept in mind while designing solutions. Many villages lack the proper infrastructure to support new technologies. Communication facilities are limited, lack of local technically skilled labor, lack of security, etc. After evaluating these opportunities and challenges, an attempt has been made to devise a smart street lighting solution tailored for remote rural areas in India. One part of the solution discusses how intensity of the LED street lights can be varied according to the ambient lighting conditions using sensors and LED switching in LED matrix. An artificial intelligence (AI) has also been modelled to identify traffic conditions using PIR sensors and object identification through image processing and independently control the lights. It also tracks the performance and status of each light. It would send this data and necessary notifications to a distant control center for human evaluation. This solution is also applicable for other rural areas throughout the world. © 2017 SPIE.",AI controlled Smart street lighting; Ambient sensing Smart street lighting; Object identification in Smart street lighting solution; Smart street lighting in India; Smart street lighting in remote areas; Smart street lighting in rural areas; Smart street lighting in villages; Switching LED matrix,Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Illuminating engineering; Image processing; Light emitting diodes; Lighting; Regional planning; Street lighting; Ambient sensing; Lighting solutions; Remote areas; Smart street lighting in India; Smart street lighting in villages; Rural areas,"Hajra, D.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, B P Poddar Institute of Management and Technology, 137, VIP Road, Poddar Vihar, India",Dietz N.Ferguson I.T.,SPIE,0277786X,9.78151E+12,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038969990

By this method of encryption, after ROI extraction, the storage of data consumes less memory and also provides faster access to the information.

In earlier of industrial rebellion, the huge number of human community rely only on agriculture. Be that as it may, now, agribusiness in India is confronting a basic reshape which prompts a troublesome condition. The one of the prime inconvenience exhibit in the horticulture is developing strikes of vermin in products. Supervision of crops from premature stage to grown up harvest stage in horticulture embraces pin-pointing and guiding of plant diseases, controlled irrigation and managed use of fertilizers and pesticides. Even if large number of remote sensing applications are developed but floor surveillance is still a trouble. Due to absence of the experts and naked eyes surveillance is not able to give actual diagnosis of the crops numerous times. Hence farmers need a well-founded system which can detect the infected crops. Instead of using complicated space capsule way outs or getting help from helpdesk which are within reach on m-services it's easy to use agrobot to observe farms, detect the diseases and automatically sprinkling of pesticides.

Many papers were published which concerned with detection of vehicle during daytime. We propose a method which detects the vehicle during nighttime since it is problematic for human to analyze the shape of vehicles in nighttime due the limits of human vision. This project endeavors to implementation of vehicle detection based on vehicle taillight and headlight using technique of blobs detection by Center Surround Extremas (CenSurE). Blobs are the bright areas of the pixels of headlight and taillight. First stage is to extract blobs from region of interest by applying multiple Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator which derive the response by manipulating variance between surrounding of blob and luminance of blob which are grabbed on road scene images. Compared to the automatic thresholding technique, Laplacian of Gaussian operator provides more robustness and adaptability to work under different illuminated conditions. Then vehicle lights which are extracted from the first stage are clustered based on the connected—component analysis procedure, to confirm that it is vehicle or not. If vehicle is detected, then tracking of vehicle is done on the basis of the connected components using bounding box and different tracking parameters. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Advanced driving and assistance system; Computer vision; Image processing; Intelligent transport system; Vehicle detection,Advanced driver assistance systems; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Headlights; Image processing; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Laplace transforms; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Assistance system; Automatic thresholding; Connected component; Intelligent transport systems; Laplacian of Gaussian; Laplacian-of-gaussian operators; Region of interest; Vehicle detection; Vehicles,"Wankhede, R.Y.; Embedded System Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering, SRM UniversityIndia; email: ram1103w@gmail.com",Das S.Panigrahi B.K.Dash S.S.Vijayakumar K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Seam carving is one such content aware image resizing technique. In this work seam carving is used to downsize an image. This is achieved by carving out an optimal seam (either vertical or horizontal), which contains less information. Each seam removes a pixel from every row (or column) to reduce the height (or width) of the image. To prevent distortion resulting from uniform seam carving, we propose an algorithm that uses a new energy gradient function.

More than 50% of India’s population is dependent (directly or indirectly) on agriculture for their livelihood. In India many crops are cultivated, out of which wheat being one of the most important food grain that this country cultivates and exports. Thus it can be seen that wheat forms a major part of the Indian agricultural system and India’s economy. Hence, maintenance of the steady production of above stated crop is very important. The main idea of this project is to provide a system for detecting wheat leaf diseases. The given system will study the leaf image of a wheat plant through image processing and pattern recognition algorithms.

The core idea of the proposed technique lies in the selection of significant and less significant coefficients in the wavelet domain. Significant and less significant coefficients are encrypted using pseudo-random number sequence and coefficient permutation respectively. Furthermore, encrypted significant data is compressed by quantization and entropy coding while, less significant encrypted data is efficiently compressed by discarding irrelevant information using SVD and Huffman coding techniques. At receiver side, a reliable decompression and decryption technique is used to reconstruct the original image content with the help of compressed bit streams and secret keys. The performance of proposed technique is evaluated using parameters such as Compression Ratio (CR) and Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed work over prior work on compression of encrypted images and obtain the compression performance comparable to state of art work on compression of unencrypted images i.e. JPEG standard. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Compression ratio; Huffman coding; Image compression; Peak signal to noise ratio; Singular value decomposition,Audio signal processing; Codes (symbols); Compression ratio (machinery); Cryptography; Data compression; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image compression; Image processing; Signal to noise ratio; Singular value decomposition; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Compression performance; Compression techniques; Encrypted images; Huffman coding; Lossy compressions; Original images; Peak signal to noise ratio; Pseudorandom number sequences; Image coding,"Vaish, A.; Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar UniversityIndia; email: av21lko@gmail.com",,Elsevier Inc.,10512004,,DSPRE,,English,Digital Signal Process Rev J,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988423360

In several scenarios hand gestures play a vital role by virtue of them being the only means of communication. For example hand signals by a traffic policeman, news reader on TV gesturing news for the deaf, signalling in airport for navigating aircrafts, playing games etc. So, there is a need for robust hand pose recognition (HPR) which can find utility in such applications. The existing state-of-the-art methods are challenged due to clutter in the background. We propose a deep learning framework to recognise hand gestures robustly. Specifically we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify hand postures despite variation in hand sizes, spatial location in the image and clutter in the background. The advantage of our method is that there is no need for feature extraction. Without explicitly segmenting foreground the proposed CNN learns to recognise the hand pose even in presence of complex, varying background or illumination. We provide experimental results demonstrating superior performance of the proposed algorithm on state-of-the-art datasets. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Hand gesture recognition,Clutter (information theory); Complex networks; Computer vision; Convolution; Feature extraction; Image processing; Neural networks; Palmprint recognition; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Hand pose recognition; Hand-gesture recognition; State-of-the-art methods; Static hand gesture recognition; Traffic policemen; Varying background; Gesture recognition,"Mohanty, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: aparnamhnty@gmail.com",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Based on experience, the universally accepted size of pellets for efficient blast furnace operations is between 9 millimeters to 16 millimeters. But presence of smaller size pellets or fines lowers the blast furnace stack permeability, increases dust losses and may lower the maximum permissible blast temperature for smooth operation of the furnace. Pellets too big are also undesirable, particularly if its reducibility is low and is poor in strength, thus undergoing physical degradation during furnace operation. This paper relates to a non-contact method of measuring the size of green pellets being fed into the Blast furnace. A method is developed for the automatic size characterization of green pellets in the conveyor belts before the pellets are being indurated in a travelling grate furnace to confer the required physical and metallurgical properties. The method employs imaging and illumination devices installed in the conveyor belt in the pellet plant of Tata Steel and then, processing those images using imaging algorithms to obtain the size distribution. Apart from the size distribution of the green pellets, the system also identifies the pelletizing disc from which the green balls originated so as to effectively control the pelletizing process. © 2017 International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology.",Image analysis; Image processing; Machine vision; Metals,,"Subramanyam, V.; Automation Division, Tata SteelIndia; email: v.subramanyam@tatasteel.com",,Chinese Institute of Automation Engineers,22239766,,,,English,Int.

The reconstructed matrices are then binarized using triangular fuzzy membership values. Then the binarized matrix is assigned weights to obtain the texture features. Histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of texture values of each promoter and later histogram difference is computed across pairs of promoters.

However, the large volume of data poses difficulties because of increased bandwidth and limited storage space. Hence, this has led to the need for compression techniques. Image compression with block processing allows the coder to adapt to local image statistics and exploit the correlation present among neighboring image pixels. The main degradation factor of block transform coding is blocking artifacts (visually undesirable patterns) at high compression ratios. The degradation occurs because of coarse quantization of the transform coefficients and the independent processing of the blocks. In this paper, the novelty of the algorithm is its ability to detect and reduce the blocking artifacts using nonseparable discrete fractional Fourier transform (NSDFrFT) at high compression ratios. Three transform techniques, namely nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and bicubic interpolation, were implemented. The NSDFrFT-bicubic interpolation resulted in a structurally similar high subjective quality reconstructed image with reduced blocking (for low frequency images) at high compression ratios. Simulation results are calculated with many image quality metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio, mean square error, structural similarity index, and gradient magnitude similarity measure. Evaluations, such as comparisons between the proposed and existing algorithms (DFrFT, FFT), are presented with relevant tables, graphs, and figures. © TÜBÏTAK.",Compression ratios; Discrete fractional Fourier transform; Image compression; Interpolation methods; Nonseparable discrete fractional Fourier transform,Compression ratio (machinery); Digital storage; Fourier transforms; Image processing; Image quality; Interpolation; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Bilinear interpolation; Compression techniques; Discrete fractional Fourier transforms; Image compression algorithms; Interpolation method; Nearest neighbor interpolation; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity indices; Image compression,"Jindal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: neeru.jindal@thapar.edu",,Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences,13000632,,,,English,Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020745041

The main concern in cloud storage is its privacy. To obtain privacy the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability has to be maintained. This paper addresses about the development of a new Android application that will provide the cloud users to store the geotagged secret image in the form of shares in to various CSP and reconstruct the secret image back by combining the shares. This key idea will provide security to the stored data. Here in this paper we also propose a (1, k, n) secret image sharing scheme constructed by using (k-1, n-1) secret image sharing scheme.

Video watermarking in compressed domain has gained importance since videos are stored and transmitted in a compressed format. This decreases the overhead to fully decode and re-encode the video for embedding and extraction of the watermark. High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265) is the latest and most efficient video compression standard and a successor to H.264 Advanced Video Coding. In this article, we propose a robust watermarking framework for HEVC-encoded video using informed detector. A readable watermark is embedded invisibly in P frames for better perceptual quality. Our framework imposes security and robustness by selecting appropriate blocks using a random key and the spatio-temporal characteristics of the compressed video. A detail analysis of the strengths of different compressed domain features is performed for implementing the watermarking framework. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of the proposed work.

Automatic table structure extraction is a challenging problem in the field of document layout analysis. In this paper, an automatic table detection and cell extraction using image morphological operations proposed. The proposed system comprises of four distinct steps. Corners and line intersections identification step, which detects the four outer corners and all the inner line intersections using nine structuring elements. Textual elements present in the table may create false corners and line intersections, which affects the identification of cells in a table. The proposed system introduced two methods namely, the intersection operation between structuring elements followed by a projection profile for removing false corners and line intersection in the noise removal step. Finally, cells in a table are identified using connected components. Our proposed system is tested on tables without textual information, tables with textual information, tables with increased line thickness and tables with no rows and column lines under diverse background and various sizes. The result shows our proposed system provides better results. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

In this aspect, lots of reversible data hiding (RDH) techniques are available as literature. Still ample measures can be adhered to achieve better reversibility. This paper presents an improved reversible RDH technique to perform a quantitative study to evaluate the recovery of sent image without any distortion. In reversible data hiding, the original image has to go through the encryption and embedding process before transmitting to the receiver. In the proposed RDH technique, a series of computations are done on the three LSB to embed secret bits in the encrypted image. Similarly, the reverse computations are performed on the LSBs to extract the original image content from the decrypted image.

Human body is often abstracted using minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) and approximated as a set of MBRs corresponding to different body parts. Such approximations assume eachMBR as an independent entity. This defeats the idea that these are parts of the whole body. A representation schema for interaction between entities, each of which is considered as set of related rectangles or what is referred to as extended objects holds promise.

Feature subset selection is an important task in pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems. The generalization performance of the system is not only depending on optimal features but also dependent upon the classifier (learning algorithm). Therefore, it is an important task to select a fast and efficient classifier. Research efforts have affirmed that extreme learning machine (ELM) has superior and accurate classification ability. However, ELM is failed to handle the uncertain data. One of the alternative solutions is fuzzy-ELM, which combines the advantages of fuzzy logic and ELM. GA-FELM is able to handle curse of dimensionality problem, optimization problem and weighted classification problem with maximizing classification accuracy by minimizing the number of features. In order to validate the efficiency of GA-FELM, the comparative performance is evaluated by using three different approaches viz. 1. ELM and GA-ELM 2. GA-ELM and GA-FELM 3.

The result analysis shows that classification accuracy is improved with 9% while reducing 62% features. © 2017 IEEE.",,Feature extraction; Fuzzy logic; Image processing; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Classification accuracy; Comparative performance; Extreme learning machine; Feature subset selection; Generalization performance; Minimizing the number of; Optimal feature subset selections; Parameter optimization techniques; Genetic algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Storage devices contain large amount of digital images, increasing the response time of a system to retrieve images required from such collections, which degrades the performance. Various search skills are needed to find what we are searching for in such large collections. The annotations are given manually for images by describing with the set of keywords. By doing so, the contents of an image retrieve images of interest, but it is time-consuming. Also, different individuals may annotate the same image using different keywords, which make it difficult to create a suitable classification and annotate images with the exact keywords. To overcome all these reasons, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the area which is used for extracting images. The technique gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is discussed and analyzed for retrieval of image. It considers the various features such as color histogram, texture, and edge density.

Automation of such a process is going to be beneficial for industries facing shortage of skilled workforce. Machine Vision techniques are some of the popular approaches for developing such automations. Most of the existing works on the topic deal with identification of the rice variety by analyzing images of well separated and isolated rice grains from which a lot of geometrical features can be extracted. This paper proposes techniques to estimate geometrical parameters from the images of scattered as well as heaped rice grains where the grain boundaries are not clearly identifiable. A methodology based on convexity is proposed to separate touching rice grains in the scattered rice grain images and get their geometrical parameters. And in case of heaped arrangement a Pixel-Distance Contribution Function is defined and is used to get points inside rice grains and then to find the boundary points of rice grains. These points are fit with the equation of an ellipse to estimate their lengths and breadths. The proposed techniques are applied on images of scattered and heaped rice grains of different varieties. It is shown that each variety gives a unique set of results. © 2017 SPIE.,Convexity calculation; Geometrical parameters; Least square ellipse fitting; Pixel-Distance Contribution Function (PDCF); Scattered and heaped rice grains,Computer vision; Data mining; Geometry; Grain boundaries; Image classification; Image processing; Pixels; Boundary points; Contribution function; Ellipse fitting; Geometrical features; Geometrical parameters; Rice grain image; Rice grains; Skilled workforces; Grain (agricultural product),,Nikolaev D.P.Verikas A.Zhou J.Radeva P.Zhang W.,SPIE,0277786X,9.78151E+12,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029957468

The average people would not try to learn the sign language that is understood by the deaf and dumb community, which puts the aurally challenged at a great disadvantage and danger. We have attempted to design an engine that runs on open Computer Vision (CV) to break the barriers of communication between the two communities. The main aim is to let the user have the freedom of conveniently communicating with each other and the computing devices of daily use (fans, lights). The implementation of this method can also be used to alert the user’s guardians of the physical state of the user in the case of an aurally challenged person.

The hand gestures are dynamically recognised by the use of Raspberry pi 3 modules.

Because of large annotation vocabulary, there exist large variations in the number of images corresponding to different labels (“class-imbalance”). Additionally, due to the limitations of human annotation, several images are not annotated with all the relevant labels (“incomplete-labelling”). These two issues affect the performance of most of the existing image annotation models. In this work, we propose 2-pass k-nearest neighbour (2PKNN) algorithm. It is a two-step variant of the classical k-nearest neighbour algorithm, that tries to address these issues in the image annotation task. The first step of 2PKNN uses “image-to-label” similarities, while the second step uses “image-to-image” similarities, thus combining the benefits of both. We also propose a metric learning framework over 2PKNN. This is done in a large margin set-up by generalizing a well-known (single-label) classification metric learning algorithm for multi-label data. In addition to the features provided by Guillaumin et al. (2009) that are used by almost all the recent image annotation methods, we benchmark using new features that include features extracted from a generic convolutional neural network model and those computed using modern encoding techniques. We also learn linear and kernelized cross-modal embeddings over different feature combinations to reduce semantic gap between visual features and textual labels.

Motivated by this problem, the proposed method deblurs facial images to detect and improve faces degraded by blur in the scenario like banks, ATMs where sparse crowd is present. Prevalent Viola Jones technique detect faces, but fails in the presence of blur. Hence, to overcome this, first the target frame is decomposed using Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) into LL, LH, HL and HH bands. The LL band is processed using Lucy-Richardson’s algorithm which removes blur using Point Spread Function (PSF). Then the super enhanced de-blurred frame without ripples is given into Viola-Jones algorithm. It has been observed and validated experimentally that, the detection rate in the Viola Jones algorithm has been improved by 47 %.

In this paper, we present a novel DCT-based technique for detecting copy-move forgery. DCT is applied to each fixed-size overlapping block of image to represent its features. The dimension of the features is reduced using truncation. Then the feature vectors are lexicographically sorted and, duplicated image blocks will be neighboring in the sorted list. Thus duplicated image blocks will be compared in the matching step. To make the method more robust, a scheme to judge whether two feature vectors are similar is imported.

However, these tasks become sophisticated due to spatial and temporal changes in the video background. In this work, we have proposed a background subtraction algorithm that efficiently localizes the object in the scene. In the next stage, a regional level process is integrated by calculating the Shannon energy and entropy to correctly examine the nonstationary pixels in the frames. In order to extract the object efficiently, the background model is updated to the dynamics changes that reduces the false negative pixels on foreground. Further, an adaptive Kalman filter is integrated to track the object in consecutive frames.

In particular, face verification has been extensively used to endorse financial transactions. Thermal face recognition is an upcoming approach in this field. This work proposes a robust thermal face recognition system based on face localized scale-invariant feature transform (FLSIFT). FLSIFT tackles the problem of thermal face recognition with complex backgrounds. Experimental results of proposed FLSIFT thermal face recognition system are compared with the existing Blood Vessel Pattern method. To test the performance of proposed and existing method, a new thermal face database consisting of Indian people and variations in the background is developed. The thermal facial images of 113 subjects are captured for this purpose. The test results show that the recognition accuracy of Blood Vessel Pattern technique and FLSIFT on face images with simple background is 79.28 % and 100 %, respectively. Moreover, the test performance on the complex background for the two methods is found to be 5.55 % and 98.14 %, respectively.

A photometric refinement is applied to accurately estimate the surface normal and thus surface albedo. A novel skin-mask construction algorithm is also used to restrict the processing to facial region of the input image. The face is relighted with novel illumination parameters.

Data hiding, also referred as watermarking, was introduced to authenticate medical data which is sent over the network. Watermarking of electronic patient reports (EPR) for telemedicine demands robust, imperceptible, high payload techniques. Blood vessel extraction is mainly used for diabetic retinopathy (DR) for automatic extraction and classification of severity of diseases. In our current work, blood vessel from fundus images is extracted using K-means segmentation. Afterwards, EPR is hidden using interpolation and trigonometric functions in fundus image.

The color-To-grayscale image conversion is the important pre-processing step which must incorporate the significant and discriminative contrast and structure information in the converted grayscale images as in the original color image. All the existing techniques for color-To-grayscale image conversion preserves the significant contrast and structure information in the converted grayscale images in different manners. Hence, the present work is to analyze the significant and discriminative contrast and structure information preserved in the converted grayscale images using two different decolorization techniques called rgb2gray and singular value decomposition based color-To-grayscale image conversion (SVD) applied in the color image classification systems using the three different proposed features.

This is due to the high spectral and spatial resolution of HSI data and lack of labelled data. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for phenotypic discovery based on autoencoders, which is trained using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixels. The distinctive archetypes from the learnt digital traits are selected using simplex volume maximisation (SiVM). Their accumulation maps are employed to reveal differential drought responses of wheat cultivars based on t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) and the separability is quantified using cluster silhouette index. Unlike prior methods using raw pixels or feature vectors computed by fusing predefined indices as phenotypic traits, our proposed framework shows potential by separating the plant responses into three classes with a finer granularity. This capability shows the potential of our framework for the discovery of data-driven phenotypes to quantify drought stress responses. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Autoencoders; Deep learning; Drought stress; Hyperspectral; SiVM; SLIC superpixels; t-SNE,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Drought; Hyperspectral imaging; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Pixels; Spectroscopy; Stochastic systems; Autoencoders; Drought stress; HyperSpectral; SiVM; Superpixels; t-SNE; Image processing,"Bhugra, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: eez138301@ee.iitd.ac.in",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In the satellite image processing, large scale images put the limitation on the single computer analysis. Whereas, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) gives a remarkable solution to handle these files through its inherent data parallelism technique. This architecture is well suited for structured data, as the structured data can be equally distributed easily and access the relevant data. Images are considered as unstructured matrix data in Hadoop and the whole part of the data is relevant for any processing. It leads to a challenge to maintain the data locality with the equal data distribution. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique, which decrypts the standard format of raw satellite data and localizes the distributed preprocessing step on the equal split of datasets in Hadoop. For this purpose, a suitable modification on the Hadoop interface is proposed. For the case study on the scalability of preprocessing steps, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multispectral (MS), are used in a distributed environment. © 2017 The Authors.

For motion vector within the frames in Super resolution, the motion estimation algorithms are used. Motion estimation gives a fully designed algorithm in programmable platforms. Highest spatial accuracy is used by the algorithm to adapt the resolution of the image content where it is necessary, that is the border of the moving objects. Binocular vision is the most focused work in reconstruction of image and helps in collecting motion and depth image from defocused images. Shape from Focus (SFF) method is a sequence of images, which is used in the application where high resolution of focused images is given priority. It helps in removing blurred frames and helps in reconstruction. A framework model is proposed in this paper to derive HR images from LR images using motion estimation algorithms and further reconstruction algorithms are implemented using SFF.

The various existing spatial domain techniques such as local binary pattern (LBP), Local ternary pattern (LTP), Local derivative pattern (LDP) and Local tetra pattern (LTrP) are encoding the spatial relationship between the neighbors with their center pixel in image plane. The first attempt has been made in 3D using spherical symmetric three dimensional local ternary pattern (SS-3D-LTP). But, the performance of SS-3D-LTP is depend on the proper selection of threshold value for ternary pattern calculation. Also, multiscale and color information are missing in SS-3D-LTP method. In the proposed method i.e. 3D-LTraP, the first problem is overcome by using binary approach Similarly, the other lacunas are avoided by using wavelet transform which provide directional as well as multiscale information and color features are embedded in feature generation process itself.

The apriori or fp-tree based approaches are not directly extendable to temporal databases to obtain similar temporal patterns.

Digitized documents, either handwritten or printed, contain a mixture of text and non-text elements which need to be separated for designing a document layout analyzer or even an Optical Character Recognizer. In this paper, a technique is described to separate the text objects from the non-text objects present in a handwritten document image. For this purpose, a Rotation Invariant Local Binary Pattern (RILBP) based texture feature is used to represent the said components, at the feature space. Finally, the classification is carried out using an Artificial Neural Network based classifier called, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). The system provides an impressive result on a database comprising of 100 handwritten document images. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Handwritten document images; Rotation invariant local binary pattern; Text/Non-text separation,Automation; Binary images; Bins; Image processing; Intelligent computing; Neural networks; Optical character recognition; Separation; Automated systems; Handwritten document; Handwritten document images; Local binary pattern operators; Local binary patterns; Multi layer perceptron; Rotation invariant; Texture features; Character recognition,"Bhowmik, S.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Dumkal Institute of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: showmik.cse@gmail.com",Mandal J.K.Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Sanyal M.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The objective is to explore the colour spaces for their suitability in automatic classification of certain textures in industrial applications, namely, granite tiles and wood textures, using computer vision. The directional subbands of digital image of material samples are obtained using wavelet transform. The anisotropic diffusion is employed to obtain the texture components of directional subbands. Further, statistical features are extracted from the texture components. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is employed on feature space to achieve class separability. The proposed method has been experimented on RGB, HSV, YCbCr and Lab colour spaces. The k-NN classifier is used for texture classification. For experimentation, image samples from MondialMarmi database of granite tiles and Parquet database of hard wood are considered. The experimental results are encouraging due to reduced time complexity, reduced feature set size and improved classification accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art-methods. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Anisotropic diffusion; Colour texture classification; Granite tiles; Industrial applications; Linear discriminant analysis; Wavelet transform; Wood textures,Anisotropy; Color; Diffusion; Discriminant analysis; Granite; Industrial applications; Mathematical transformations; Nearest neighbor search; Optical anisotropy; Pattern recognition; Wavelet transforms; Anisotropic Diffusion; Automatic classification; Classification accuracy; Linear discriminant analysis; State-of-the-art methods; Statistical features; Texture classification; Texture components; Image processing,"Bhusnurmath, R.A.; Department of P.G.

Most of the modern imaging systems are based on Infra Red Focal Plane Arrays (IRFPAs), which consists of an array of detector element placed at focal plane of optics module. Performance of IRFPAs operating in Medium Wave Infra Red (MWIR) and Long Wave Infra Red (LWIR) spectral bands are strongly affected by spatial and temporal Non-Uniformity (NU). Due to difference in the photo response of detector elements within the array, Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN) becomes severe. To exploit the potential of current generation infrared focal plane arrays, it is crucial to correct IRFPA for fixed-pattern noise. Different Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) techniques have been discussed and real-time performance of two-point non-uniformity correction related to IR band is presented in this paper. The proposed scheme corrects both gain and offset non-uniformities. The techniques have been implemented in reconfigurable hardware (FPGA) and exploits BlockRAM memories to store the gain and offset coefficients in order to achieve real-time performance.

Yawning is one of the signs, which indicates whether the person is drowsy or not. Most of the algorithms in literature detect yawn state considering the region between the lips. Mouth localization is the fundamental step in yawn detection. Region between the lips is segmented using algorithms of different complexities. In this work, a simple segmentation algorithm like thresholding is investigated for its effectiveness. The segmented region with maximum area within the mouth region is considered to classify the frame as yawn frame or otherwise. Yawn video sequences from YawDD dataset are used to test and validate the algorithm. Yawn detection accuracy using the proposed algorithm is 76% which is bit higher than the accuracy obtained with more complex algorithm.

The way of identifying the fissure lobes in computed tomography scanned lung images are difficult for the medical practitioners because of the incorrect shapes alongside with less contrast and the extraordinary noise associated with it [1]. The last phase of the lung cancer treatment is the elimination of the unhealthy lung by the major surgery. So, it is required to identify the location of the cancer affected part of the lungs by extracting the fissure lobes before making the proposal for the surgery.

The existence of a huge number of symbols and varying characteristics in these languages makes segmentation and extraction of text a challenging task. The Tamil language has a wide variety of the literature, and printed text is available in various forms such as newspaper, books, and magazines. In this paper, extraction of printed Tamil text from an image is done irrespective of the characteristics of the text such as font style, color, and size. The proposed work uses scanned printed Tamil text as the input image. This input image is binarized since text is always available in the foreground, and histograms can be used to segment them into lines and words. The morphological operator, dilation, is used to remove outliers such as dots and commas present in an underlying object and segment the printed text into words to facilitate text detection. Further, each character is identified using bounding box technique. Classification of Tamil letters is done by extracting features such as gradient information and curvature-based information obtained from grayscale and binary images. These features are trained, and characters are classified using Bayesian classifier. The recognized characters are documented as text using Unicode format. The performance of the approach is evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Binarization; Bounding box; Character recognition; Classification; Dilation; Segmentation; Tamil text detection,Artificial intelligence; Binary images; Classification (of information); Data mining; Extraction; Image processing; Image segmentation; Text processing; Binarizations; Bounding box; Bounding box techniques; Dilation; Extracting features; Gradient informations; Morphological operator; Text detection; Character recognition,"Manisha, S.; Department of CSE, SSN College of EngineeringIndia; email: manishas@ssn.edu.in",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The above task has been accomplished through a feature extraction technique, based on bitwise XOR operation between consecutive gray scale frames of the video. Thresholding mechanism is employed to segment the videos into shots. Dissimilarity matrix is constructed to select a representative keyframe from every shot of a video sequence. The proposed shot boundary detection and keyframe extraction approach is implemented and evaluated on a subset of TRECVID 2001 data set.

This degradation is a spatially varying phenomena, which makes this problem non trivial. Dehazing is an essential preprocessing stage in applications such as long range imaging, border security, intelligent transportation system, etc. However, these applications require low latency of the preprocessing block. In this work, single image dark channel prior algorithm is modified and implemented for fast processing with comparable visual quality of the restored image/video. Although conventional single image dark channel prior algorithm is computationally expensive, it yields impressive results. Moreover, a two stage image dehazing architecture is introduced, wherein, dark channel and airlight are estimated in the first stage. Whereas, transmission map and intensity restoration are computed in the next stages. The algorithm is implemented using Xilinx Vivado software and validated by using Xilinx zc702 development board, which contains an Artix7 equivalent Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and ARM Cortex A9 dual core processor. Additionally, high definition multimedia interface (HDMI) has been incorporated for video feed and display purposes. The results show that the dehazing algorithm attains 29 frames per second for the image resolution of 1920x1080 which is suitable of real time applications.

The proposed approach integrates RGB intensity as fuzzified input variables, temperature as defuzzified output variables and fuzzy inference rules based Mamdani models. Based on the color characteristics of burning flame, temperature of different flame zones are located using a fuzzy logic controller. The temperature level at hotspot area is the highest and through the fuzzy analysis we were able to identify hotspot area from the flame image. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, quantitative metric such as f-measure has been used and it was found that the f-measure metric yields high accuracy for the hotspot area. The visual inspection of the results along with the f-measure values showed the superiority of our work. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can be applied to a high resolution video flame image. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

The Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) together with impulse noise (IN) is one typical example of mixed noise. Most of the noise removal methods detect the locations of impulse noise pixels and then removes mixed noise. The presence of strong mixed noise leads to unwanted artifacts and to solve this issue a weighted encoding with sparse nonlocal regularization (WESNR) method is available and it removes mixed noise by soft impulse detection through weighted encoding. In this work, WESNR is used to eliminate mixed noise. Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) technique is used to encrypt denoised image and hides data for the purpose of secure communication.

One of the main aspects of CT that researchers remain focused, is on reducing the dosage as Xrays are generally harmful to human bodies. In order to reduce radiation dosage, compressed sensing (CS) based methodologies appear to be promising. The basic premise is that medical images have inherent sparsity in some transformation domain. As a result, CS provides the possibility of recovering a high quality image from fewer projection data. In general, the sensing matrix in CT is generated from Radon projections by appropriately sampling the radial and angular parameters. In our work, by restricting the number of such parameters, we generate an under-determined linear system involving projection (Radon) data and a sparse sensing matrix, bringing thereby the problem into CS framework. Among various recent solvers, the Split-Bregman iterative scheme has of late become popular due to its suitability for solving a wide variety of optimization problems. Intending to exploit the underlying structure of sensing matrix, the present work analyzes its properties and finds a banded structure for an associated intermediate matrix. Using this observation, we simplify the Split-Bregman solver, proposing thereby a CTspecific solver of low complexity. We also provide the efficacy of proposed method empirically. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Compressed sensing; Computed tomography; Least squares; Split-Bregman,Compressed sensing; Computer vision; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Iterative methods; Linear systems; Matrix algebra; Medical imaging; Optimization; Radon; Tomography; Compressive sensing; High quality images; Iterative schemes; Least Square; Optimization problems; Sparse sensing matrixes; Split bregman; Transformation domain; Computerized tomography,"Prasad, T.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology HyderabadIndia; email: ma13p1004@iith.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,3029743,,,,English,Lect.

Manual sorting is the traditional approach that has been preferred by industries. In this approach, visual inspection is performed by human operators. This traditional approach is tedious, time-consuming, slow and inconsistent. Therefore the efforts are made to design and implement the technique of automation to determine colour based tablet inspection and sorting using image processing technique. In this paper, image of a colored tablet strip which is rolling over a conveyer belt has been captured using appropriate image acquisition device. Using image processing, the tablet of desired color has been tracked using thresholding technique. Once the colour of the object is determined, the system will automatically inspect and sort the objects as per its colour and counts in the strip. In this machine vision system, algorithm for tablet colour determination has been developed in MATLAB software and object sorting assembly has been designed using Arduino microcontroller circuitry. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

To overcome the ambiguity and impreciseness, Zadeh [20] introduced fuzzy set theory in the year 1965. The underlying power of fuzzy sets is that linguistic variables can be used rather than quantitative variables to represent imprecise concepts which are continuous transitions. The continuous imprecise concepts need to be modeled by continuous fuzzy numbers instead of intervals and real numbers. Many researchers applied triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which are piecewise linear and continuous for imprecise concepts because of its convenience and ease. But imprecise variables in the fields of decision making, data analysis, fuzzy control, image processing, fuzzy clustering etc., need not be linear always. So parabolic fuzzy numbers can be used for modeling nonlinear fuzzy concepts to have a better accuracy in real life problems. Since parabolic fuzzy numbers are not completely studied till now and the triangular fuzzy numbers have been thoroughly studied, triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers may be used as supplementary tool along with parabolic fuzzy numbers. Approximation is a kind of de-fuzzification that has to change non-linear functions into linear functions which reduces the fuzziness for the undefined information and produces a better accuracy. So the study of approximation of parabolic fuzzy numbers is necessary and hence, in this paper, the problem of triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers is attempted using distance function in terms of ?-cuts. Some properties of the parabolic fuzzy numbers which are useful in multi criteria decision making (MCDM) have also been discussed. Finally pertinent illustrations and applications of the approximation of parabolic fuzzy number have also been given. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Increasing advancements in the quality of image capturing devices and photo editing softwares have made the process of image forgery easy. Copy move forgery is the most frequent type among the various types of forgery. This paper presents a novel technique to detect copy move forgery that uses Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) keypoints. First, the image is sectioned into nonoverlying blocks using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. After this, the feature points are selected using SURF. The matching of the SURF points of different segmented regions is done using cosine similarity. The matched regions represent the forged areas. This method has a low computational complexity and shows good results even if the forged area is rotated or scaled. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Copy move forgery; Image forgery; SLIC; SURF,Clustering algorithms; Color image processing; Image matching; Image processing; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Copy-move forgeries; Image capturing devices; Image forgery; Iterative clustering; Low computational complexity; SLIC; Speeded up robust features; SURF; Computer crime,"Sachdev, K.; Department of Computer Science, UIET, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: kanicasachdev@yahoo.co.in",Singh R.Choudhury S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

One can obtain surface detected version of a 3D image by processing the 2D slices using 2D edge detection operation, and consequently the 3D surface detection operation is termed as 2.5D image processing. One could also process the 3D image data using a 3D surface detection algorithm, which is termed as 3D processing. This is not the case with the operation of skeletonisation. One cannot make use of 2.5D skeletonisation operation of 2D slices in order to get skeltonised version of the corresponding 3D image.

The collision of an animal with the vehicle on the highway is one such big issue, which leads to such road accidents. In this paper, a simple and a low-cost approach for automatic animal detection on highways for preventing animal-vehicle collision using computer vision techniques are proposed. A method for finding the distance of the animal in real-world units from the camera mounted vehicle is also proposed. The proposed system is trained on more than 2200 images consisting of positive and negatives images and tested on various video clips of animals on highways with varying vehicle speed. As per the two-second rule, our proposed method can alert the driver when the vehicle speed is up to 35 km/h. Beyond this speed, though the animal gets detected correctly, the driver does not get enough time to prevent a collision. An overall accuracy of almost 82.5% is achieved regarding detection using our proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.",Cascade classifier; computer vision; haar; histogram of oriented gradient; image processing; intelligent vehicle system; OpenCV; road injuries,Accidents; Animals; Classification (of information); Highway accidents; Image processing; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Cascade classifiers; haar; Histogram of oriented gradients; Intelligent vehicle systems; OpenCV; road injuries; Computer vision,"Sharma, S.U.; Department of Electronics and Communication, Gujarat Technological UniversityIndia; email: sharma.f@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018466509

The basic challenge for designing a watermarking system is a dilemma between transparency and robustness. If we want a higher rate of transparency, there has to be a compromise in terms of its robustness and vice versa. Also, until now, watermarking is generalized, resulting in the need for a specialized algorithm to work for a specialized image processing application domain. Our proposed technique takes into consideration the image characteristics for watermark insertion and it optimizes transparency and robustness.

To merge test data in SVM model, we find the euclidean distance between test data and support vector of target class and the coefficients of MED of support vector of training class are assigned to test data.

The rover, developed to compete in the Mars Society’s University Rover Challenge 2015, was designed to perform various tasks such as site survey, sample return, equipment servicing, and astronaut assistance in a Mars-like landscape of dry, non-vegetated, rocky terrain. The complete design features a bioinspired eight-wheeled drive mechanism, an integrated robotic arm along with a stereo vision technique for advanced image processing. This paper focuses on the drive mechanism of the rover design. The 8-wheeled rover combines the rocker-bogie mechanism with four rocker wheels and four spider-leg wheels. The spider legs ensure that it can traverse over heights greater than the chassis height, which could be three times as much as the diameter of the wheels. NASA’s current rover can only traverse a height twice the diameter of the wheel. Additionally, the wheels are actuator-powered, and hence, the slope of the rover can be adjusted in such a way that it does not topple for a wide range of inclination allowing the rover to traverse over highly rugged terrain. The rover design can be modified for many applications notably the exploration of alien planets, deep sea trench, and other environments where human exploration is almost impossible. This effort to make the rover mechanism more efficient may one day be instrumental in detecting life and many such possibilities, in Mars and other planets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Drive mechanism; Mars rover; Spider legs,Bogies (railroad rolling stock); Design; Image processing; Intelligent robots; Martian surface analysis; NASA; Planets; Robots; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision; Wheels; Drive mechanism; Equipment servicing; Human exploration; Mars Exploration Rover; Mars Rovers; Rocker bogie mechanism; Rocker bogie suspension; Spider legs; Suspensions (components),"Suresh, A.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa VidyapeethamIndia; email: aswathashh10@gmail.com",Karray F.Kim J.-H.Myung H.Jo J.Sincak P.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78332E+12,,,English,Adv.

Usually in video clips, shots repeat after one another, in that case the basic shot detection scheme gives redundant key frames from same video. In this work, we have proposed a hierarchical shot detection and key frames selection scheme which reduce a considerable amount of redundant key frames.

This paper presents novel local edge profile detection and preservation based denoising algorithm for digital images in presence of zero mean Gaussian noise. Detecting and preserving sharp changes in image pixel intensities preserves the visual quality of the denoised image. Twenty four different types and orientations of edges are detected in 3×3 overlapping tiles of a picture. Based on the edge type and orientation, each tile is subjected to integration along the direction of the detected edge. This preserves the edges. Simple averaging is done if a tile does not have any edge. Continuity of edges is maintained by taking the overlapping tiles of the same edge and integrating both the neighbouring tiles in the direction of the edge. The integration across the edges are avoided to preserve the sharpness of the edges. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with other denoising algorithms in terms of a novel edge representation parameter i.e. number of edge tiles in the input image. The proposed algorithm clearly outperforms the other contemporary algorithms. Most of the other algorithms either over construct or under construct the edges during denoising. © 2017 IEEE.",Conditional filtering; Denoising; Edge preservation; Local Edge detection; Local Profile,Gaussian noise (electronic); Image denoising; Image processing; Image segmentation; Contemporary algorithms; De-noising; De-noising algorithm; Edge preservations; Image pixel intensities; Local edge detections; Local Profile; Visual qualities; Edge detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The computational burden and complexity depends upon the parametric model adopted for the task. Learning based techniques to implement the scheme using low dimensional manifolds offer computationally more efficient alternatives. In this paper we have employed Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Deep Learning (with auto encoders) for manifold learning in the visual domain as well as for the parameters of robotic manipulator for visual servoing. Images of clusters of cylindrical pellets were used as the training data set in the visual domain. Corresponding parameters of the six degrees of freedom robot for picking designated cylindrical pellet formed the training dataset in the robotic configuration space. The correspondence between the weight coefficients of LLE manifold in the visual domain and robotic domain is established through regression. Autoencoders in conjunction with feed forward neural networks were used for learning of correspondence between the high dimensional visual space and low dimensional configuration space. We have compared the results of the two implementations for the same dataset and found that manifold learning using auto encoders resulted in better performance.

The stereo-radiographic reconstruction involving bi-planar X-rays is one of the most commonly used methods. Algorithms with stereo-corresponding point (SCP) or non-stereo-corresponding point (NSCP) can be used to achieve this 3D reconstruction. But, the NSCP method is slower and needs manual identification of many anatomical landmarks. Hence it suffers from observer variability and has restricted usage in normal clinical setup. Thus, a hybrid method is proposed in which the SCP reconstructed model is refined using the geometric features from the X-rays to achieve the accuracy closest to NSCP method. The SCP model is constructed using the X-rays on a calibration bench from the scoliotic subject. From these X-rays the vertebral features are extracted automatically. The SCP model structure is refined using the geometric transformations according to the extracted features. The 3D model thus formed is called combined SCP and geometric (CSCPG) reconstruction. By considering the NSCP model as a reference, both qualitative and quantitative approaches are followed to validate the proposed model. The CSCPG method has lesser observer variability as it needs only six anatomical landmarks per vertebra. Further, it is faster and the reconstruction error is within the acceptable limits. To quantify the deformities like axial vertebral rotation and spinal curvature novel methods have been proposed. The axial vertebral rotation is measured using simple vertebra vector parametric computations. It needs identification of only two landmarks per vertebra for angle measurement. The apical vertebra gives the plane of maximum curvature. The actual spinal curvature has to be computed on this plane. A semi-automatic method is proposed to compute this curvature using a new projection technique. The deformity quantification methods are validated using manual measurements as well as the results from standard approaches. Hence, a fast, simple and economic 3D diagnostic method is developed for quantification of the spinal deformities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",3D reconstruction of spine; Generic spine model; Scoliosis; Stereo-radiography,Geometry; Image reconstruction; Mathematical transformations; Musculoskeletal system; 3D reconstruction; Geometric transformations; Manual identification; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Quantification methods; Scoliosis; Semiautomatic methods; Three-dimensional reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics; acetabulum; adolescent; algorithm; anatomic landmark; Article; child; clinical article; Cobb angle; combined stereo corresponding point reconstruction; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; geometric stereo corresponding point reconstruction; human; idiopathic scoliosis; image processing; image reconstruction; imaging and display; kyphosis; lordosis; nerve ending; priority journal; spine malformation; spine radiography; spinous process; stereoradiography; third lumbar vertebra; three dimensional imaging; transverse process; vertebra body; X ray,"Kumar, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication, Manipal Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kumar.sampath@manipal.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

Squint eye is the term associated with the misalignment in projection of the eye and hence provides binocular vision. Mathematical modeling of retina plays a vital role to produce better visual perception. The main aim of this work is to develop an HVS (human visual system) model for detecting the perceptual level of people with strabismus (squint). People with normal vision is capable of perceiving as one single image when the image falls on the retina. The situation is not the same in case of people with strabismus. One of the main symptoms of strabismus people is double vision, which is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object. This paper focuses on the mathematical modeling of retinal layers namely photoreceptor, outer-plexiform and inner-plexiform layers and to provide an insight knowledge on the occurrence of double vision in the case of people with strabismus (medical term used for squint eye). It is proved through the proposed model that the energy level of normal vision person is higher than people with strabismus and the intensity level is approximately the same after processing through the photoreceptor layer. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Binocular vision; Compression; Human visual system (HVS); Perception; Strabismus,Binocular vision; Bins; Compaction; Intelligent computing; Ophthalmology; Sensory perception; Stereo image processing; Vision; Human Visual System; Human visual system model; Human visual systems; Photoreceptor layers; Simultaneous perceptions; Strabismus; Visual perception; Visual recognition; Image processing,"Rajalakshmi, T.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, SRM UniversityIndia; email: rajalakshmi.t@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in",Dash S.S.Deiva Sundari P.Das S.Panigrahi B.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

In these cases multispectral images are limited with small spectral variation in heterogeneous classes. For better classification, high spectral variance among different classes and low spectral variance within a particular class should exhibit. In the consideration of this issue, a Fixed point (FP) based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method is utilized to get better classification accuracy in the existing mixed classes that consist similar spectral behavior. This FP-ICA method identifies the objects from mixed classes having similar spectral characteristics, on sphering high resolution satellite images (HRSI). It also helps to reduce the effect of similar spectral behavior between different image classes. The estimation of independent component related to non-gaussian distribution data (image) with optimizing the performance of this approach with the help of nonlinearity, which utilize the low variance between similar spectral classes. It is quite robust, effortless in computation and high convergence rate, even though the spectral distributions of satellite images are rigid to classify. Hence, this FP-ICA approach plays a key role in image classification such as buildings, grassland area, road, and vegetation. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Fixed point; Image classification; Independent component analysis; Mixed classes; Negentropy; Non-gaussianity,Computer vision; Image analysis; Image classification; Independent component analysis; Satellites; Fixed points; High resolution satellite images; Independent component analysis(ICA); Mixed class; Negentropy; Non-gaussian distribution; Nongaussianity; Spectral characteristics; Image processing,"Singh, P.P.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar, BTADIndia; email: pankajp.singh@cit.ac.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Text detection and text segmentation in video data and images is a difficult task due to low contrast and noise from background. Our methodology focuses not only on spatial information of pixel but also optical flow of image data for detecting moving and static text. This paper provides an iterative algorithm with super resolution to reduce information into its fundamental unit, like alphabets and digits in our case.

Due to low resolution of images there is a text cluster to remove this text cluster, it is super resolved using sub pixel mapping and hence again passed through process for further segmentation giving an overall accuracy to around 80%.

Even though VCS has the major advantage that the decoding can be done with the help of Human Visual System (HVS), yet it does not provide sufficient reconstruction quality. Hence, Two in One Image Secret Sharing Scheme (TiOISSS) is used which provides two decoding phases. However, the existing TiOISSS method has several limitations. In this work, a Modified TiOISSS is proposed in which an adaptive threshold is used for halftoning, which changes depending on the nature of the pixels present in image. By this, the quality of reconstructed secret image is improved in the first decoding stage compared to the existing scheme. In addition, the security is also enhanced by pixel and bit level permutation with a 64 bit key and embedding the key in Gray VCS shadows. To verify the authenticity of the image, a secret message is also embedded in the shadows. Security analysis shows that the Modified TiOISSS is robust to Brute Force and Man-in-Middle attacks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Adaptive halftoning; Halftoning; Polynomial image secret sharing; Visual cryptography,Cryptography; Decoding; Pixels; Cryptographic techniques; Halftoning; Human visual systems; Image secret sharing; Man-in-middle attacks; Reconstruction quality; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Image processing,"Sudha, G.F.; Department of Electronics & Communication, Pondicherry Engineering CollegeIndia; email: gfsudha@pec.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947770950

Knowledge-based user authentication with the combination of keystroke dynamics as biometric characteristics relates the issues to user authentication/identification in cloud computing based applications. Our approach is the one way, where the performance of the keystroke dynamics biometricin user recognition can be improved by using soft biometric traits that provides some additional information about the user which can be extracted from the typing pattern on a computer keyboard or touch screen phone. These soft biometric traits have low discriminating power but can be used to enhance the performance of user recognition in accuracy and time efficiency. In this paper, we are interested in using this technique in thestatic keystroke dynamics user authentication system. It has been observed that the age group (18?30/30+or < 18/18+), gender (male/female), handedness (left-handed/right-handed), hand(s) used (one hand/both hands), typing skill (touch/others) and emotional states (Anger/Excitation) can be extracted from the way of typing on a computer keyboard for single predefined text. This soft biometric information from typing pattern as extra features decreases the Equal Error Rate (EER).

Target recognition in infrared images is demanding owing to large variations in target signature and limited target to background contrast. This demands robust features/descriptors which can represent possible variations of the target category with minimal intra class variance. LBP, a simple yet efficient texture operator initially proposed for texture recognition of late is gaining popularity in face and object recognition applications. In this work, the suitability of LBP and two of its variants, local ternary pattern (LTP), complete local binary pattern (CLBP) for the task of recognition in infrared images has been evaluated. The performance of the method is validated with target clips obtained from ‘CSIR-CSIO moving object thermal infrared imagery dataset’. The number of classes is four- three different target classes (Ambassador, Auto and Pedestrian) and one class representing the background.

The conventional SSS share one secret image to n participants. With the advancement of time, there arises a need for sharing multiple secret image. An (n, n)-Multi-Secret Image Sharing (MSIS) scheme is used to encrypt n secret images into n meaningless shared images and stored it in different database servers. For recovery of secrets all n shared images are required. In earlier work n secret images are shared among n or n + 1 shared images, which has a problem as one can recover fractional information from less than n shared images. Therefore, we need a more efficient and secure (n, n)-MSIS scheme so that less than n shared images do not reveal fractional information. In this paper, we propose an (n, n)-MSIS scheme using additive modulo and reverse bit operation for binary, grayscale, and colored images. The experimental results report that the proposed scheme requires minimal computation time for encryption and decryption.

The objective of this paper is to develop a low-dose CT image reconstruction method based on statistical sonogram smoothing approach. The proposed method is casted into a variational framework and the solution of the method is based on minimization of energy functional. The solution of the method consists of two terms, viz., data fidelity term and a regularization term. The data fidelity term is obtained by minimizing the negative log likelihood of the signal-dependent Gaussian probability distribution which depicts the noise distribution in low-dose X-ray CT. The second term, i.e., regularization term is a nonlinear CONvolutional Virtual Electric Field Anisotropic Diffusion (CONVEF-AD) based filter which is an extension of Perona–Malik (P–M) anisotropic diffusion filter. The main task of regularization function is to address the issue of ill-posedness of the solution of the first term. The proposed method is capable of dealing with both signal-dependent and signal-independent Gaussian noise, i.e., mixed noise. For experimentation purpose, two different sinograms generated from test phantom images are used. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of existing methods. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms many recent approaches and is capable of removing the mixed noise in low-dose X-ray CT. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Anisotropic diffusion; Image reconstruction algorithm; Noise reduction; Statistical sinogram smoothing; X-ray computed tomography,Anisotropy; Computer vision; Diffusion; Electric fields; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Image reconstruction; Noise abatement; Optical anisotropy; Probability distributions; Tomography; Anisotropic Diffusion; Anisotropic diffusion filters; Gaussian probability distributions; Image reconstruction algorithm; Regularization function; Sinogram smoothing; Virtual electric field; X-ray computed tomography; Computerized tomography,"Tiwari, S.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)India; email: stiwari.rs.cse@iitbhu.ac.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Automated soccer video analysis is a challenging due to involvement of more actors and rapid movements of players and camera. It is necessary first to detect various events of the video precisely before analyzing and labeling them. This paper proposes frame based approach for the automatic demarcation of events of the soccer video. However this task is very challenging due to variety of soccer leagues, various illumination and ground conditions. To overcome such issues we propose method which is invariant to such conditions and can successfully demarcate the soccer events. We exploit optical flow techniques to measure the motion. We introduce change in optical flow to extract the behavior of an event over the video span. Later, adaptive threshold is computed based on change in optical flow. We conducted number of simulations with variety of videos to validate the method. Proposed method achieves nearly 90% of accuracy and found robust in spite of illumination variation. © 2017 IEEE.",adaptive threshold; event; optical flow; video summarization,Adaptive optics; Optical data processing; Optical flows; Sports; Adaptive thresholds; event; Event boundary detection; Ground conditions; Illumination variation; Optical flow techniques; Soccer video analysis; Video summarization; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The early stage of breast cancer detection helps in avoiding the removal of breast in women and even the death caused due to breast cancer. There are many computer aided softwares that are designed to detect breast cancer but still only biopsy method is effective in predicting the exact scenario. This biopsy technique is a painful one. To avoid this, a novel classification approach for classifying microcalcification clusters based on framelet transform is proposed. The real -time mammography images were collected from Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, Chennai, India in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The GLCM features (contrast, energy and homogeneity) are extracted from the framelet decomposed mammograms with different resolution levels and support vector machine classifier is used to classify the unknown mammograms into normal or abnormal initially and then further classifies it as benign or malignant if detected as abnormal. The result shows that framelet transform-based classification provides considerable classification accuracy. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Framelet transform; GLCM features (contrast energy and homogeneity); Microcalcifications and mammography; Support vector machine,Biopsy; Calcification (biochemistry); Computer vision; Diseases; Mammography; Medical imaging; Support vector machines; X ray screens; Breast cancer detection; Classification accuracy; Classification approach; Framelet transforms; GLCM feature; Microcalcification clusters; Microcalcifications; Support vector machine classifiers; Image processing,"Thivya, K.S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Easwari Enginnering CollegeIndia; email: grss_dew@yahoo.co.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

It is a non-invasive procedure to evaluate the presence of eye diseases and monitor the response to treatments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a system designed using infrared thermal image processing that detects glaucoma. Euclidean distance based segmentation technique is used to threshold the IR image to obtain the region of interest, where the manifestation of glaucoma is predominant. Features are extracted using statistical moments from the temperature mapped IR image and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix of the IR image. Two significant attributes, namely the homogeneity and area of region of interest are the inputs to a Support Vector Machine classifier to classify a given input ocular thermal image as a normal or diseased image. In our simulation study, one hundred ocular thermal images with even number of normal and diseased subjects were analysed. The classifier has achieved a maximum accuracy of 96% when homogeneity and area of region of interest are used as attributes, indicating the potential use of proposed method for screening patients even at early stages of glaucoma.",Glaucoma; Gray level co-occurrence matrices; Support vector machine; Temperature mapping; Thermal imaging,Diagnosis; Image classification; Image processing; Infrared imaging; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ophthalmology; Support vector machines; Thermography (imaging); Glaucoma; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Infrared thermal image; Segmentation techniques; Simulation studies; Statistical moments; Support vector machine classifiers; Temperature mapping; Image segmentation,,,University of Zagreb,13301136,,,,English,J.

Distributing the labeling task among a large set of workers (may be experts or non-experts) and obtaining the final consensus is a popular way of performing large-scale annotation in a limited time. Collection of multiple annotations can be effective for annotation of large-scale datasets for applications like natural language processing, image processing, etc. However, as the crowd workers are not necessarily experts, their opinions might not be accurate enough. This causes problem in deriving the final aggregated judgment. Again, majority voting (MV) is not suitable for such problems because the number of annotators is limited and they have multiple options to choose. This might cause too much conflicts among the opinions provided. Additionally, there might exist annotators who randomly try to annotate (provide spam opinions for) too many questions to maximize their payment. This can incorporate noise while deriving the final judgment. In this paper, we address the problem of crowd judgment analysis in an unsupervised way and a biclustering-based approach is proposed to obtain the judgments appropriately. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on four publicly available small-scale Amazon Mechanical Turk datasets, along with a large-scale CrowdFlower dataset. We also compare the algorithm with MV and some other existing algorithms. In most of the cases the proposed approach is competitively better than others. But most importantly, it does not use the entire dataset for deriving the judgment. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Biclustering; Judgment analysis; Majority voting; Opinion ensemble,Image processing; Natural language processing systems; Amazon mechanical turks; Bi-clustering; Distributed power; Judgment analysis; Large-scale datasets; Majority voting; NAtural language processing; Opinion ensemble; Problem solving,"Bhattacharyya, M.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, Howrah – 711103, India; email: malaybhattacharyya@it.iiests.ac.in",,Elsevier Inc.,200255,,ISIJB,,English,Inf Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991491128

Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. The carbon emissions resulting from mangrove loss especially biomass are uncertain. The point to be noted that mangroves biomass towards carbon stock is needed because when the changes occurs, much of carbon stock in the ecosystem will release to the atmosphere which may result in global warming, pollution etc. In this context, remote sensing is a tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem biomass and carbon studies through digital image processing and modeling. Remote sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map and monitor mangrove conditions and changes. The Krishna mangroves in Andhra Pradesh are located in the coastal plains of Krishna delta. This study provides reviews and highlighting remotely sensed data applied for measuring Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in Krishna mangrove forest from remote sensing perspective. This study assessed tree above ground biomass using a Support vector machine regression model equation. The Above Ground Biomass estimated from the model was 198.47 Mg/ha and an Allometric equation for Avicennia marina mangrove species was used to cross validate the estimated AGB from remote sensing technique and the average AGB from the field measurement was 217.53 Mg/ha. Thus the study reveals that the remote sensing is an effective tool to estimate above ground biomass with a good accuracy.

Then, regularized least-squares filtering is performed constrained to the noise power computed from the image. Pre-filtering is also done to avoid unwanted high frequency drops.

Unlike foreign countries, road traffic conditions of India are heterogeneous due to which detection, counting and classification of vehicles in real-time has become difficult. Due to fixed and predefined nature of traffic light switching traffic congestion is often. In nutshell, an improved and optimized traffic control system is required. Introducing Beagle Bone Black/Rasp Pi to the traffic light system provides numerous customizations to turn a traditional traffic light into a smart one. To control traffic at road intersections, system containing microcontroller is established on traffic light. Image processing algorithms, such as Haar Cascade and Background Subtraction are used to control timer. We have developed traffic control system model for the main intersections of road.

Therefore, designing authentication methodologies using various input modalities receivedmuch attention of the researchers of this domain. Sincewe access such personalized devices everywhere including crowded places such as offices, public places, meeting halls, etc., the risk of an imposter gaining one’s identification information becomes highly feasible. One of the oldest but effective form of identity theft by observation is known as shoulder surfing. Patterns drawn by the authentic user on tablet surfaces or keys typed through keyboard can easily be recognized through shoulder surfing.

The distribution of patch-level confidence scores is collated into an image-level decision of presence or absence of PDR.

This results into mixing of features in a pixel leading to loss of individuality. Mixing noticeably decreases with high resolution spectral data. But it still persists and depends on how the feature is arranged on the ground. The unavailability and non-accessibility of high resolution imagery of target area lead to the process of spectral unmixing and sub-pixel classification.In digital image processing, spectral unmixing is a common phenomenon which decomposes reflectance spectra into a set of given end member spectra.In this paper, various standard methodologies such as Fuzzy, Distance and Least square to Orthogonalizations were applied and compared on the basis of quantitative analysis on water features to identify the ebst method. The experiments were carried on a set of Landsat-8 data to evaluate the performance of spectral unmixing.

In this paper, we have proposed an unsupervised way of clustering object trajectories to filter out movements that deviate large from the usual patterns. A scene is divided into nonoverlapping rectangular blocks and importance of each block is estimated. Two statistical parameters that closely describe the dynamic of the block are estimated. Next, these high-level features are used to cluster the set of trajectories using k-means clustering technique.

Visually challenged persons are the persons who are either blind or having any kind of difficulty in reading any printed material to acquire the domain knowledge. A lot of research is being done for visually challenged to make them independent in their life. We want to study the existing assistive technology for visually challenged and then propose a robust reading framework for visually challenged. The discussed reading framework will help the visually challenged person to read normal printed books, typed documents, journals, magazines, newspapers and computer displays of emails, Web pages, etc., like normal persons. It is a system based on image processing and pattern recognition using which visually challenged person carries or wears a portable camera as a digitizing device and uses computer as a processing device. The camera captures the image of the text to be read along with the relevant image and data. An optical character recognition (OCR) system segregates the image into text and non-text boxes, and then, the OCR converts the text from the text boxes to ASCII or text file. The text file is converted to voice by a text-to-speech (TTS) converter. Thus, blind person would ‘hear’ the text information that has been captured. So this technology can help the visually challenged to read the captured textual information independently which will be communicated as voice signal output of a text-to-speech converter. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Assistive technology; OCR and TTS; Reading framework; Visually challenged,Artificial intelligence; Cameras; Character sets; Data mining; Image processing; Network function virtualization; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Websites; Assistive technology; Domain knowledge; Optical character recognition (OCR); Printed materials; Processing device; Reading framework; Textual information; Visually challenged; Character recognition,"Verma, A.; BBD UniversityIndia; email: avinash.verma93@yahoo.com",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

A popular diagnostic method involves histopathological microscopy imaging, which can be augmented by automated image analysis. In histopathology image analysis, stain normalization is an important procedure of color transfer between a source (reference) and the test image, that helps in addressing an important concern of stain color variation. In this work, we hypothesize that if color-texture information is well captured with suitable features using data containing sufficient color variation, it may obviate the need for stain normalization. Considering that such an image analysis study is relatively less explored, some questions are yet unresolved such as (a) How can texture and color information be effectively extracted and used for classification so as to reduce the burden on the uniform staining or stain normalization. (b) Are there good feature-classifier combinations which work consistently across all magnifications? (c) Can there be an automated way to select reference image for stain normalization? In this work, we attempt to address such questions. In the process, we compare the independent texture and color channel information with that of some more sophisticated features which consider jointly color-texture information. We have extracted above features using images with and without stain normalization to validate the above hypothesis. Moreover, we also compare different types of contemporary classification in conjunction with the above features. Based on the results of our exhaustive experimentation we provide some useful indications. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Color-texture features; Histopathology image analysis; Random forest; Stain normalization; SVM,Automation; Classification (of information); Color; Color image processing; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Endoscopy; Image analysis; Image classification; Image processing; Medical imaging; Robotics; Automated classification; Automated image analysis; Color texture features; Color-texture information; Feature classifiers; Histopathological microscopy; Random forests; Stain normalization; Image texture,"Gupta, V.; Indian Institute of Technology MandiIndia; email: vibha_gupta@students.iitmandi.ac.in",Arbel T.Cardoso M.J.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In our work block histogram based auto center seed k-means clustering technique is used to segment all the possible nodule candidates. Efficient shape and texture features (2D and 3D) were computed to eliminate the false nodule candidates. The two-stage classifier is used in this work to classify the malignant and benign nodules. First stage rule-based classifier producing 100% sensitivity, but with high false positive of 13.1 per patient scan. The BPN based ANN classifier is used as the second-stage classifier which reduces a false positive to 2.26 per patient scan with a good sensitivity of 88.8%. The nodule growth predictive measure was modeled through the features such as tissue deficit, tissue excess, isotropic factor and edge gradient. The overlap of these measures for larger, average and minimum nodule growth cases are less. Therefore this developed growth prediction model can be used to assist the physicians while taking the decision on the cancerous nature of lung nodules from an earlier CT scan. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",3D shape feature; 3D texture feature; Computed tomography; Lung nodule classifier; Lung nodule growth,Biological organs; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Tissue; Tomography; 3-D shape; 3D textures; Computed tomography images; K-means clustering techniques; Lung nodule; Lung nodule detection; Rule-based classifier; Two-stage classifiers; Computerized tomography,"Krishnamurthy, S.; Anna UniversityIndia; email: tkseneee@gmail.com",Hangarge M.Negi A.Bevilacqua V.Santosh K.C.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

This paper initially proposes two approaches which help to represent color images in a ternary quantum system based on the modified concept of famous FRQI model and normalized amplitude based quantum representation model. But these approaches are complicated and have several drawbacks. Finally, a simple and a new model of color image representation and storage in a ternary (3-levels) quantum system is presented in this paper. This model deals with a set of quantum states for M different color levels and another set of quantum states for P different position coordinates. In this paper, various gray levels of a color image and their corresponding positions are stored in a 3n color quantum register. For sake of simplicity this proposed method is carried out on 3 × 3 pixels of color image example and the model is built by using basic ternary gates. A basic measurement of a pixel in a quantum image is also presented in this paper. Comparisons among these three quantum image representation approaches are also discussed at the last section of this paper. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Multilevel quantum computing; Quantum color image processing; Quantum information; Qubit; Qutrit; Ternary quantum image processing,Color; Image processing; Pixels; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Quantum Computing; Quantum image processing; Quantum Information; Qubit; Qutrit; Quantum theory,"Chakraborty, S.; A.K.

In this paper, we propose a novel assignment model of visual words for representing an image patch. In particular, a vector is used to represent an image patch with its elements denoting the affinities of the patch to belong to a set of closest/most influential visual words. We also introduce a dissimilarity measure, consisting of two terms, for comparing a pair of image patches. The first term captures the difference in affinities of the patches to belong to the common set of influential visual words. The second term checks the number of visual words which influences only one of the two patches and penalizes the measure accordingly.

Here, we seek to propose a general scheme which does not make assumptions regarding the relative position of body parts. Practitioners of Indian classical dances such as Bharatnatyam often enact several dramatic postures called Karanas. However, several challenges such as long flowing dresses of dancers, occlusions, change of camera viewpoint, poor lighting etc. affect the performance of state of- the-art pose estimation algorithms [1, 2] adversely. Body postures enacted by practitioners performing Yoga also violate the assumptions used in current techniques for estimating pose. In this work, we adopt an image recognition approach to tackle this problem. We propose a dataset consisting of 864 images of 12 Karanas captured under controlled laboratory conditions and 1260 real-world images of 14 Karanas obtained from Youtube videos for Bharatnatyam. We also created a new dataset consisting of 400 real-world images of 8 Yoga postures.

Arnold transform has been used to scramble the secret image to secure the extraction of secret image. Lifting scheme is applied on the cover image to get the wavelet subbands. In this algorithm, scrambled secret image is embedded into significant wavelet coefficients of subbands of cover image. Scaling factor (SF) parameter is used in embedding and extracting process of the proposed algorithm and GA is used to optimise this parameter. This optimisation is used to maximise the value of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of composite image and similarity index modulation (SIM) of extracted secret image. Experimental results reveal that proposed algorithm provides high embedding capacity and better quality of composite images than the existing data hiding techniques. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, statistical tests have been performed to show that the imperceptibility is maintained. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Arnold transform; Genetic algorithm; Integer wavelet transform; IWT; Lifting scheme; Peak signal noise ratio; Scaling factor; SF; SIM; Similarity index modulation,Image coding; Image processing; Modulation; Optimization; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Signal to noise ratio; Steganography; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Arnold transform; Integer wavelet transforms; Lifting schemes; Peak signal noise ratio; Scaling factors; Similarity indices; Genetic algorithms,"Kasana, G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: gkasana@thapar.edu",,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,17441765,,,,English,Int.

The growth of vastness in both size and dimensionality creates rigorous dispute to feature selection and extraction algorithms. High dimensionality augments increased cost and complexity of the classification task. Therefore, reducing dimensionality is necessary and inevitable as it enhances the performance of the classification process. As the data is compressed, the storage space is lessened.

In India snow covered areas found in rugged/ mountainous region in the Himalayas. For such a terrain satellite data provide timely and efficient information. A study was undertaken to integrate estimation of physical parameters of snow based on ground truth data collection and satellite data. The SOI toposheet at 1:50000 scale was used. DEM was generated using ASTER data to for elevation and slope. For physical parameter estimation, multispectral and hyperspectral satellite data were digitally processed using ERDAS Imagine, ArcGIS and ENVI software. Landsat-8 data of October 2016 were used for generating Land use/Land cover map and surface temperature map. Also, Hyperion data of January 2016 were used for snow grain size studies. Out of 220 bands, selected bands only used for processing. Preprocessing involves removal of bad bands, bad column and removing the influence of the atmosphere. FLAASH atmospheric correction model is applied on Hyperion data to retrieve surface reflectance in ENVI 5.1 software. Snow grain size has been estimated using spectral angle mapper (SAM) and grain index (GI) method. Spectral reflectance for different grain size was collected in field, using optical spectroradiometer and compared with satellite derived spectra during February 2017. Snow has high reflectance in visible and low in SWIR. Comparing results of SAM and GI it is revealed that GI shows higher percentage of fine grained snow than SAM and this could be attributed to cloud covered areas getting misclassified in SAM. The results obtained by the GI classification method appear to be more factual, as snowfall being more during the month of January. Thus, it is concluded that by integrating field based observations and image processing methods applied on satellite data provide more accurate estimation for snow studies. © 2017 ACRS.

However, the task is laborious and demands skill. Associated high cost and low throughput drew considerable interest in automating the testing process. Several neural network architectures were designed to provide human expertise to machines. In this paper, we explore and propose the feasibility of using deep-learning networks for cytopathologic analysis by performing the classification of three important unlabeled, unstained leukemia cell lines (K562, MOLT, and HL60). The cell images used in the classification are captured using a low-cost, high-throughput cell imaging technique: microfluidics-based imaging flow cytometry. We demonstrate that without any conventional fine segmentation followed by explicit feature extraction, the proposed deep-learning algorithms effectively classify the coarsely localized cell lines. We show that the designed deep belief network as well as the deeply pretrained convolutional neural network outperform the conventionally used decision systems and are important in the medical domain, where the availability of labeled data is limited for training. We hope that our work enables the development of a clinically significant high-throughput microfluidic microscopy-based tool for disease screening/triaging, especially in resource-limited settings. © 2016 Optical Society of America.",,"Cell culture; Cells; Cytology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Feature extraction; Imaging techniques; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Personnel training; Throughput; Convolutional neural network; Decision systems; Deep belief networks; Disease screening; Fine segmentations; High throughput; High throughput cell imaging; Human expertise; Microfluidics; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; algorithm; artificial neural network; HL-60 cell line; human; image processing; K-562 cell line; machine learning; microfluidics; microscopy; pathology; procedures; Algorithms; HL-60 Cells; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; K562 Cells; Machine Learning; Microfluidics; Microscopy; Neural Networks (Computer); Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma","Subrahmanyam, G.R.K.S.; Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: gorthisubrahmanyam@iist.ac.in",,OSA - The Optical Society,10847529,,JOAOD,28059233,English,J Opt Soc Am A,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009237688

A temporal association pattern is said to be similar if it satisfies specified subset constraints. The apriori algorithm which is designed for static databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns from temporal databases as patterns are vectors with supports computed at different time slots and Euclidean distance do not satisfy monotonicity property. The brute force approach to find similar temporal patterns requires computing 2n true support combinations for ‘n’ items from finite item set and problem falls in NP-class. In this present research, we come up with novel approach to discover temporal association which are similar for pre-specified subset constraints, and substantially reduce support computations.

A level 2, 2D DWT is applied on L* component of L*a*b* color image and the LL2 approximation sub-band image is chosen for feature extraction. The features are extracted by utilizing a sequence of circles on approximation sub-band image. Finally, the robust binary hash is generated from extracted features.

Such data are preferably archived and transmitted in the compressed form to realize storage and transmission efficiency. Through compression, though data becomes storage and transmission efficient, its processing gets expensive as it requires decompression as many times the data needs to be processed; and this requires additional computing resources. Therefore it would be novel, if the data processing and information extraction could be carried out directly from the compressed data without subjecting it to decompression.

The MHD uses coordinate pairs of edge pixels derived from ear template and skin regions of the side face image to locate the ear portion. To detect ears of various shapes, ear template is created by considering different structure of ears and resized it automatically for the probe image to find exact location of ear.

Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India","Purpose: Current practices in data classification and retrieval have experienced a surge in the use of multimedia content. Identification of desired information from the huge image databases has been facing increased complexities for designing an efficient feature extraction process. Conventional approaches of image classification with text-based image annotation have faced assorted limitations due to erroneous interpretation of vocabulary and huge time consumption involved due to manual annotation. Content-based image recognition has emerged as an alternative to combat the aforesaid limitations. However, exploring rich feature content in an image with a single technique has lesser probability of extract meaningful signatures compared to multi-technique feature extraction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of enhanced content-based image recognition by fusion of classification decision obtained using diverse feature extraction techniques. Design/methodology/approach: Three novel techniques of feature extraction have been introduced in this paper and have been tested with four different classifiers individually. The four classifiers used for performance testing were K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, RIDOR classifier, artificial neural network classifier and support vector machine classifier. Thereafter, classification decisions obtained using KNN classifier for different feature extraction techniques have been integrated by Z-score normalization and feature scaling to create fusion-based framework of image recognition. It has been followed by the introduction of a fusion-based retrieval model to validate the retrieval performance with classified query. Earlier works on content-based image identification have adopted fusion-based approach. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, fusion-based query classification has been addressed for the first time as a precursor of retrieval in this work. Findings: The proposed fusion techniques have successfully outclassed the state-of-the-art techniques in classification and retrieval performances. Four public data sets, namely, Wang data set, Oliva and Torralba (OT-scene) data set, Corel data set and Caltech data set comprising of 22,615 images on the whole are used for the evaluation purpose. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, fusion-based query classification has been addressed for the first time as a precursor of retrieval in this work.

Separating those scripts having matra from those which do not have one, can be used as a precursor to ease the subsequent script identification process. In our work, we consider two matra-based scripts namely Bangla and Devanagari as positive samples, and the counter samples are obtained from two different scripts namely Roman and Urdu. Altogether, we took 1204 document images with a distribution of 525 matra-based (325 Bangla and 200 Devanagari) and 679 without matra-based (370 Roman and 309 Urdu) scripts. For experimentation, we have used three different classifiers: multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and BayesNet (BN), with the target of selecting the best performer.

However, retrieval of important activities from such a large data can be time consuming. Thus, researchers are working on finding solutions to present hours of visual data in a compressed, but meaningful way. Video synopsis is one of the ways to represent activities using relatively shorter duration clips. So far, two main approaches have been used by researchers to address this problem, namely synopsis by tracking moving objects and synopsis by clustering moving objects. Synopses outputs, mainly depend on tracking, segmenting, and shifting of moving objects temporally as well as spatially. In many situations, tracking fails, thus produces multiple trajectories of the same object. Due to this, the object may appear and disappear multiple times within the same synopsis output, which is misleading. This also leads to discontinuity and often can be confusing to the viewer of the synopsis. In this paper, we present a new approach for generating compressed video synopsis by grouping tracklets of moving objects. Grouping helps to generate a synopsis where chronologically related objects appear together with meaningful spatio-Temporal relation. Our proposed method produces continuous, but a less confusing synopses when tested on publicly available dataset videos as well as in-house dataset videos. © 2017 IEEE.",Non-chronological synopsis; Spatio-Temporal grouping; Trajectory grouping; Video synopsis,Data handling; Security systems; Compressed video; Finding solutions; Non-chronological synopsis; Spatio temporal; Spatio-temporal relations; Surveillance cameras; Tracking moving objects; Video synopsis; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Both HSI color information and edge detection are applied separately and simultaneously. The color segmented image is obtained by taking the union of HSI color information and edge detection. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with existing region-growing algorithm by considering three parameters, precision (P), recall (R) and F1 value. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is also measured by using precision-recall (PR) and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis.

Further the method also extracts discriminative features for an accurate diagnosis of ASD. The proposed approach determines a spatial filter that projects the covariance matrices of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time-series signals from both the ASD patients and neurotypical subjects in orthogonal directions such that they are highly separable. The inverse of this filter also provides a spatial pattern map within the brain that highlights those regions responsible for the distinguishable activities between the ASD patients and neurotypical subjects. For a better classification, highly discriminative log-variance features providing the maximum separation between the two classes are extracted from the projected BOLD time-series data. A detailed study has been carried out using the publicly available data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) consortium for the different gender and age-groups. The study results indicate that for all the above categories, the regional differences in resting state activities are more commonly found in the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere of the brain. Among males, a clear shift in activities to the prefrontal cortex is observed for ASD patients while other parts of the brain show diminished activities compared to neurotypical subjects. Among females, such a clear shift is not evident; however, several regions, especially in the posterior and medial portions of the brain show diminished activities due to ASD. Finally, the classification performance obtained using the log-variance features is found to be better when compared to earlier studies in the literature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Autism spectrum disorder; Fukunaga–Koontz transform; Functional connectivity; Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging; Spatial filtering; Support vector machine,Beamforming; Brain; Brain mapping; Covariance matrix; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electronic data interchange; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroimaging; Neurophysiology; Support vector machines; Time series; Autism spectrum disorders; Blood oxygen level dependents; Classification performance; Discriminative features; Functional connectivity; Orthogonal directions; Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; Spatial filterings; Functional neuroimaging; adolescent; adult; Article; autism; BOLD signal; brain region; diagnostic accuracy; electroencephalogram; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; groups by age; human; image processing; left hemisphere; major clinical study; male; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; right hemisphere; sex difference; time series analysis; autism; brain; brain mapping; case control study; diagnostic imaging; hemispheric dominance; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; procedures; rest; Adolescent; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prefrontal Cortex; Rest,"Sundaram, S.; School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 02b-45, block n4, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore; email: ssundaram@ntu.edu.sg",,Elsevier B.V.,13618415,,MIAEC,27585835,English,Med.

Ultrasound has the capability to identify larger sized and more mature sized tissues in compare to smaller ones. Ovarian reproductive tissues are smaller in size in compare to other available tissues in the ovary for which it is hard for ultrasound scanners to analyze ovarian reproductive tissues. Microscopic digitized color images are more viable for which at present most appropriate approach to analyze ovarian reproductive tissues remains microscopic analysis process. Manual analysis process is costly, extensive analysis time requires with observation variations between experts. To improve accuracy and reduce processing time computer based approaches have become popular for the last two decades but mostly to analyze cancer cells.

Popularity of social network provides a statistical way to predict the upcoming and outgoing fashion trends through social content data analysis. Social image data is a most expressive form of content data which is useful to get the fashion related information. But, characteristics of social data such as heterogeneity, large volume, etc. make this problem challenging. Hence, in this paper semi-supervised feature extraction and classification model is proposed based on the joint probability of multiple features. We conducted experiments on Fashion 10000 dataset [1] having images from Flickr. First, feature extraction is done where Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based matching points (using labelled and unlabelled images) along with five other features i.e. color, texture, regional, geometric and face detection (using unlabelled image) are obtained. Due to the consideration of multiple significant features, proposed approach is able to deal with the heterogeneity in given images. Linear convolution is performed to get the representative image with prominent features and it is compared with labelled representative images of each class to get the number of matching points for that class. Color and texture features are extracted with the help of RGB components and gray level co-occurrence matrix, respectively. Values of extent, eccentricity and orientation are considered as regional features and Euler number as geometric feature. As most of the social images with person consist fashion related information, face detection is also carried out to show the presence of person in given image and stored it as a feature. Then, class-conditional probabilities of all the extracted features are computed and the maximum joint probability is used while assigning the class label to the given image. Obtained results show that incorporation of matching points using CNN with other features, improves the accuracy than using only other five features. In [2], search based classification using twelve global features is carried out by B. Loni et al. on same fashion dataset where 0.7421 f1-score for visual only method is obtained. Using only six features, approximately similar results are achieved with our proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Classification; Fashion images; Feature extraction; Social data,Color matching; Convolution; Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Learning systems; Neural networks; Probability; Textile industry; Color and texture features; Conditional probabilities; Convolutional neural network; Fashion images; Feature extraction and classification; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Linear convolution; Social datum; Classification (of information),"Wazarkar, S.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: wazarkarseema@nitgoa.ac.in",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Although used widespread, local features (SIFT, STIP) invariably engender two potential problems: the counts of such extracted features are not evenly distributed in different entities of a given category and many of such features are not paradigmatic of the visual concept the entities represent. In order to generate a discriminative dictionary taking the aforementioned issues into account, we propose a novel method for identifying robust and category specific local features which maximize the class separability to a possible extent. Specifically, we consider category independent region proposals to highlight local regions in still images. Further, the selection of potent local descriptors is cast as filtering based feature selection problem which ranks the local features per category based on a novel measure of distinctiveness. The underlying visual entities are subsequently represented based on the learned dictionary and this stage is followed by action classification using the random forest model. The framework is validated on the challenging Stanford-40 dataset and exhibits superior performances than the representative methods from the literature. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Action recognition; Feature mining; Local features; Random forest,Decision trees; Image classification; Image processing; Image retrieval; Action classifications; Action recognition; Discriminative dictionaries; Feature mining; Feature selection problem; Local feature; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Image analysis,"Roy, A.; Istituto Italiano di TechnologiaItaly; email: abhinaba.roy@iit.it",Battiato S.Gallo G.Stanco F.Schettini R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The proposed model follows a non-referential based approach because aligning test and reference imagemay be difficult. In order to minimize learning complexity at each level, defect image is segmented into copper and non-copper parts. Copper and non-copper parts are analyzed separately. Final defect class is predicted by combining copper and noncopper defect classes. Edges provide unique information about distortion in copper disc. In this model, circularity measures are computed from edges of copper disc of a Copper part. For non-copper part, color information is unique for every defect type. A 3D color histogram can capture the global color distribution. The proposed model tries to compute the histogram using nonuniform bins. Variations in intensity ranges along each dimension of bins reduce irrelevant computations effectively. The bins dimensions are decided based on the amount of correlation among defect types. Discoloration type defect is analyzed independently from copper part, because it is a color defect. Final defect class is predicted by logical combination of defect classes of Copper and Non-copper part. The effectiveness of this model is evaluated on real data from PCB manufacturing industry and accuracy is compared with previously proposed non-referential approaches. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",AVI; Copper part; Non-copper part; PCB; SVM,Color; Computer vision; Defects; Graphic methods; Image processing; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Printed circuit manufacture; Amount of correlations; Color distribution; Color information; Copper parts; Defect classification; Learning complexity; Logical combination; Pcb manufacturing; Copper,"Kumar, S.; Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: shashi.kumar@iitg.ernet.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

It provides the viewer a new sense of presence and immersion. Compared to conventional rectilinear video (2D or 3D), 360° video poses a new and difficult set of engineering challenges on video processing and delivery. Enabling comfortable and immersive user experience requires very high video quality and very low latency, while the large video file size poses a challenge to delivering 360° video in a quality manner at scale. Conventionally, 360° video represented in equirectangular or other projection formats can be encoded as a single standards-compliant bitstream using existing video codecs such as H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC. Such method usually needs very high bandwidth to provide an immersive user experience. While at the client side, much of such high bandwidth and the computational power used to decode the video are wasted because the user only watches a small portion (i.e., viewport) of the entire picture. Viewport dependent 360°video processing and delivery approaches spend more bandwidth on the viewport than on non-viewports and are therefore able to reduce the overall transmission bandwidth. This paper proposes a dual buffer segment scheduling algorithm for viewport adaptive streaming methods to reduce latency when switching between high quality viewports in 360° video streaming. The approach decouples the scheduling of viewport segments and non-viewport segments to ensure the viewport segment requested matches the latest user head orientation. A base layer buffer stores all lower quality segments, and a viewport buffer stores high quality viewport segments corresponding to the most recent viewer's head orientation. The scheduling scheme determines viewport requesting time based on the buffer status and the head orientation. This paper also discusses how to deploy the proposed scheduling design for various viewport adaptive video streaming methods. The proposed dual buffer segment scheduling method is implemented in an end-to-end tile based 360° viewports adaptive video streaming platform, where the entire 360° video is divided into a number of tiles, and each tile is independently encoded into multiple quality level representations. The client requests different quality level representations of each tile based on the viewer's head orientation and the available bandwidth, and then composes all tiles together for rendering. The simulation results verify that the proposed dual buffer segment scheduling algorithm reduces the viewport switch latency, and utilizes available bandwidth more efficiently. As a result, a more consistent immersive 360° video viewing experience can be presented to the user. © 2017 SPIE.",360° video; DASH; HEVC; Segment Scheduling; Video Streaming,Bandwidth; Communication channels (information theory); Image processing; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Video streaming; Virtual reality; Adaptive video streaming; Available bandwidth; Computational power; DASH; Engineering challenges; HEVC; Transmission bandwidth; Virtual reality devices; Video signal processing,,Tescher A.G.,SPIE,0277786X,9.78151E+12,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034744881

The overall quality of many of these images can be poor if features such as haze and clouds are present during their acquisition. Under these circumstances enhancement algorithms can be used to improve image quality and their utility for identifying disaster impacted areas. There are numerous image enhancement techniques that range in complexity and time required to complete them. However, for the purpose of post-disaster response, these images have to be processed quickly without compromising their quality. In this paper, three image enhancement algorithms were tested on four satellite images to benchmark the time taken to process them and their output quality. Landsat images acquired in 2011 (Landsat 5 TM) and 2016 (Landsat 8 OLI) were used in this study. The algorithms range in their complexity and rely on global and local statistics. Results from this study would provide insights to image analysts for selecting image enhancement algorithms while processing post-disaster images. © 2017, The Imaging and Geospatial Information Society.

From the computer vision perspective, object segmentation in such videos poses quite a few challenges because the child’s view is unfocused, often with large head movements, effecting in sudden changes in the child’s point of view which leads to frequent change in object properties such as size, shape and illumination. In this paper, we develop a semi-automated, domain specific method, to address these concerns and facilitate the object annotation process for cognitive scientists, allowing them to select and monitor the object under segmentation. The method starts with an annotation of the desired object by user and employs graph cut segmentation and optical flow computation to predict the object mask for subsequent video frames automatically. To maintain accurate segmentation of objects, we use domain specific heuristic rules to re-initialize the program with new user input whenever object properties change dramatically. The evaluations demonstrate the high speed and accuracy of the presented method for object segmentation in voluminous egocentric videos. We apply the proposed method to investigate potential patterns in object distribution in child’s view at progressive ages. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Child’s egocentric video; Cognitive development; Domain specific heuristic rules; Head camera; Object perception; Object segmentation; Optical flow,Automation; Computer vision; Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Heuristic programming; Optical data processing; Optical flows; Automated methods; Cognitive development; Graph-cut segmentations; Heuristic rules; Object distribution; Object perception; Object segmentation; Optical flow computation; Image processing,"Mirsharif, Q.; Department of Computer Science, University of HoustonUnited States; email: Qazaleh.mirsharif@gmail.com",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

An image analysis is used to extract different statistical features from the leaves' dataset. From such statistical features a recognition/classification processes are performed to classify the fresh and infected leaves in each leaf type as well as to classify the two-leave species.

Tracking with moving camera sometimes fails to track the object with similar color objects or similar background. Proposed approach is a particle filter based approach. It introduces the likelihood calculated by probabilistic background model which is constructed using dense optical flow and fast density estimation. Proposed approach introduces SVM (Support Vector Machine)1 to judge the scene where it is difficult to construct the probabilistic background model with non-uniform optical flow. This SVM uses the degree histogram of optical flow.

In previous studies, this stratification has been mainly based on analysis of the far wall of the carotid artery. Due to the multifocal nature of atherosclerotic disease, the plaque growth is not restricted to the far wall alone. This paper presents a new approach for stroke risk assessment by integrating assessment of both the near and far walls of the carotid artery using grayscale morphology of the plaque. Further, this paper presents a scientific validation system for stroke risk assessment. Both these innovations have never been presented before. The methodology consists of an automated segmentation system of the near wall and far wall regions in grayscale carotid B-mode ultrasound scans. Sixteen grayscale texture features are computed, and fed into the machine learning system. The training system utilizes the lumen diameter to create ground truth labels for the stratification of stroke risk. The cross-validation procedure is adapted in order to obtain the machine learning testing classification accuracy through the use of three sets of partition protocols: (5, 10, and Jack Knife). The mean classification accuracy over all the sets of partition protocols for the automated system in the far and near walls is 95.08% and 93.47%, respectively. The corresponding accuracies for the manual system are 94.06% and 92.02%, respectively. The precision of merit of the automated machine learning system when compared against manual risk assessment system are 98.05% and 97.53% for the far and near walls, respectively. The ROC of the risk assessment system for the far and near walls is close to 1.0 demonstrating high accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Carotid wall; Far; Machine learning; Near; Precision of merit; ROC; Segmentation; Stroke; Ultrasound,"Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Morphology; Ultrasonics; Automated segmentation; Carotid wall; Classification accuracy; Grayscale morphology; Near; Precision of merit; Risk stratification; Stroke; Risk assessment; adult; aged; arterial wall thickness; Article; atherosclerotic plaque; automation; carotid artery; cerebrovascular accident; clinical assessment; clinical feature; clinical protocol; controlled study; coronary risk; echography; female; high risk patient; human; low risk patient; machine learning; major clinical study; male; priority journal; real time ultrasound scanner; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; tissue characterization; validation process; carotid artery; carotid artery disease; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; echography; image processing; machine learning; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; risk assessment; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Stroke; Ultrasonography","Suri, J.S.United States; email: Jasjit.Suri@atheropoint.com",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,27915126,English,Comput.
