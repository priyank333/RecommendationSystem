FPGAs provide accelerated computation due to their flexible architecture. However it creates challenges for the system designer as efficient design in terms of latency, power and energy demands hardware programming expertise. Hardware coding is a time consuming as well as an error prone task. High Level Synthesis (HLS) addresses these challenges by enabling programmer to code in High-level languages (HLL) such as C, C++, SystemC, CUDA and translating this code to hardware language such as Verilog or VHDL. Even though HLS tools provide several optimizations, their performance is limited due to the implementation constraints. Some of the software constructs widely used in high level language such as dynamic memory allocation, pointer-based data structures and recursion are very hard to implement well in hardware and thereby restricting the performance of HLS. Source-to-source translation is a mechanism to optimize the code in HLL so that the compiler can perform better in terms of code optimization. This article investigates whether the source-to-source translation widely used in HLL can also benefit high level synthesis. For this study, Bones source-to-source compiler is selected to perform the translation of C code to C (Optimized-C) and OpenMP code. These three types of code: C, Optimized-C and OpenMP were synthesized in LegUP HLS for three benchmarks; the performance statistics were measured for all the nine cases and analysis was conducted in terms of speedup, area reduction, power and energy consumption. OpenMP code performed better as compared to original C code in terms of execution time (speedup range 1.86-3.49), area (gain range 1-6.55) and energy (gain range 1.86-3.55). However optimized-C code did not always perform better than the original C-code in terms of execution time (speedup range 0.27-3.08), area (gain range 0.83-5.7) and energy (gain range 0.27-3.13). The power statistics observed were almost the same for all the three input versions of the code. © 2017 IEEE.","FPGA; High Level Synthesis (HLS); LegUP; performance; Source-to-source","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; C++ (programming language); Codes (symbols); Computer hardware description languages; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Memory architecture; Program compilers; Search engines; Storage allocation (computer); Translation (languages); Dynamic memory allocation; High performance computing; LegUP; performance; Performance statistics; Pointer-based data structures; Source-to-source; Source-to-source translations; High level synthesis",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

The bottom layer is printed with periodic square patches to achieve miniaturization. The antenna comprises of a square patch radiator with four T-shaped slits around the edges and a narrow diagonal slot at the center. The antenna element is placed at a height of 0.8 mm over the HIS and two simultaneous operating modes of the metasurface are studied. By using the HIS in its inductive region as a reactive impedance surface (RIS), significant reduction in the resonant frequencies up to 32.86% and 20.27% are observed in the lower and upper operating bands of the antenna, respectively.

Network-on-chip (NoC) promises to be a viable solution as the basic communication fabric for such designs. A router is the basic component of NoC and using efficient internal blocks to design a router is expected to improve the performance of a router as a whole. One such block of prime importance is an arbitration unit. The commonly used arbitration logics include Fixed Priority, Lottery and Round Robin algorithm. However, they lack the capability of dynamically changing the priority according to data flit rates of specific ports. Thus a requester sending more requests can suffer from starvation and ultimately loss of data if not served within due course of time. In this work, we propose an improved Round Robin algorithm, for increasing Quality-of-Service (QoS) of a router. This is achieved by making use of an additional control signal from the buffer of each input port named as Buffer full (b-f). This addition will help us avoid the starvation condition of input ports which have more data flits to send than the lightly loaded input ports.

They have played a pivotal role in development and advancement of technologies such as GPS Navigation, Disaster Management Systems, Telemedicine services, Tele-education services, TV Broadcasting services etc. With advancements in these technologies there is a need for robust communication system that is capable of delivering stable and reliable data continually with constraints in hardware resources, communication bandwidth, transmission power and channel nonlinearity. To meet these requirements selection of precise modulation scheme is essential. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a reconfigurable modulator which is capable of performing modulation schemes that can effectively counter the limitations listed above. The proposed modulator can perform modulation schemes such as Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Minimum Shift Keying (MSK), Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) and Unbalanced Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (UQPSK). Reconfiguration is an advanced technique for system design, wherein the same hardware resources can be reconfigured to provide different functionalities. The proposed modulator can dynamically reconfigure between modulation schemes as per the user requirement without any changes in the hardware. The proposed modulator is implemented on Virtex-5 FPGA.

The results show that the proposed antenna achieves impedance bandwidth (VSWR<2) from 7 GHz to 8.5 GHz and from 6.25 GHz to 6.8 GHz providing gain of 8.2 dB with a gain variation of less than 2 dB over the frequency band.

Owing to better electromigration resistance, low resistance and dielectric constant, scalability, ability to handle higher current densities and efficient power consumption, copper interconnects have emerged as the widely accepted metallization option to aid silicon performance improvements. At the same time, due to thickness variations and continuous shrinkage of interconnect feature sizes, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes have become challenging. This paper covers the intricacies of the CMP processes and methodologies to overcome the process difficulties encountered with copper interconnects. The need for damascene and dual damascene processes have been emphasized. Cheese and fill procedures are of prime importance to aid better manufacturability and higher yield. This paper talks about the cheese and fill procedures adopted by foundries and the extent of care taken so that the expected circuit performance doesn't get affected in any way.

These low profile planar antennas can be used within widely used bands of frequencies that is, between 800MHz to 9GHz (10 bands) of all cellular from 2G to 4G and beyond. In addition, the coverage frequency includes wireless local area networks (WLAN) and WiMax. Significant structural changes are made in one of the latest structure of multiband antenna which is a combination of L-type, C-type and inverted F-type. All of the bands showed the gain of over 2dB and significant S11 parameters of below-10dBm. Additionally, all of them have significant 3-dB bandwidth. The changes in structure further improved bandwidth, gain for some of the bands. With coupled-fed mechanism and a slotted ground structure, we obtain multiband and wideband characteristics.

The advancements happening in VLSI technology day by day have made chip testing more complicated. This has paved way for the increased popularity of Logic Built In Self Test (LBIST) compared to Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). Logic BIST allows self testing of chips with the help of an additional built-in hardware structure inside the circuit. Test-per-scan Logic BIST structure includes Test pattern generator, Response Analyzer, ROM, and Comparator. LFSR does the role of test pattern generator in Logic BIST since it is more efficient than binary counters. MISR is commonly used as an output response analyzer which acts as an alternative to n-parallel LFSRs. Comparator compares the responses stored in ROM and MISR output. Reconfigurability is added to every structural element in BIST to improve the fault coverage of IC testing. The proposed structural architecture is simulated in Modelsim RTL simulator. The different sized (16, 32, 48) programmable structures in Logic BIST were synthesized in Xilinx Spartan 3E and Spartan 6 for implementing them on FPGA.

The energy saved by adiabatic logic using FinFET is significant compared to the CMOS. This way of designing a circuit is effective in low speed operations where power consumption is more important than performance. Fin-type field-effect transistors (FinFETs) are promising substitutes for bulk CMOS at the nanoscale. Finfet, a long channel device which improves electrostatic control over device. These low power requirements have emerged due to the advancement in technology where power is more important like medical, mobile phones, hand held devices etc. In subthreshold logic, the circuit operates with supply voltage less than that of the threshold voltage of the transistor and utilizes leakage current as the operating current. This is achieved as the dynamic power consumption is quadratic ally dependent on the supply voltage. To show the results we are implementing 4-bit adder in subthreshold adiabatic logic using FinFET technology which shows that the power consumed by FinFET adiabatic logic will be less than that of normal adiabatic operation operation.

Where all master requests are having different priority. So designing the arbiter having ability to perform in worst corner cases. This paper is introduction to a modified dynamic bus arbiter based on fuzzy logic for a system on chip design architecture. We are considering the worst case here that all masters are requesting for grant to access the bus, so arbiter need to manages the situation based on information about priority scheme, previously granted master and existing lottery arbitration scheme and fuzzy logic arbitration scheme. So we proposed a new two stage technique for granting the access of data bus by creating a subset of various master on the basis of their priority and using dynamic lottery scheme at first stage and fuzzy logic in the second stage in system. This is process by Acceptance rate calculator to decide which algorithm to resolve the grant issue. A hybrid arbiter which results in removing bus starvation and contention problem. This method is also address the pseudo random number is greater than the total partial sum in modified dynamic arbiter based on lottery manager so for this deciding factor is priority selection method and information about the previously granted master which also help to improve the latency.

LDN comprises of several such sensor nodes distributed in a certain geographical area which captures lightning signals. The single sensor node system consists of the antenna, analog circuit front end, and digital back end. These sensor nodes then transmit lightning data in real time to central lightning location system (CLLS) which calculates the exact location of the lightning stroke. We have designed and implement cost effective digital back-end system for a sensor node which digitizes analog signals and performs some signal processing in the digital domain before sending the data to CLLS. Analog front-end receives and amplifies lightning very low frequency signal (VLF) signals, then presented digital system samples the analog signals at a rate of 1 Mega samples per second. This is followed by digital filtering and digital down conversion; after which the data samples are time-stamped with the corresponding real time (UTC time) then this data is sent to CLLS by UART link.

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is one of the most important components of any system and is used in many appliances like calculators, cell phones, and computers. A 32-bit ALU was designed using Verilog HDL with the logical gates such as AND and OR for each one bit ALU circuit. The design was implemented in Xilinx. It can work fast than the ALU processor using less power. The design of an ALU and a Cache memory for use in a high performance processor was examined. Reversible logic vital in recent years because it has ability to reduce the power dissipation which is main requirement in low power design. ALU which are designed using non reversible logic gates consume more power. So there is a need for lesser power consumption and the reversible logic has been playing vital role during recent years for low power VLSI Design techniques. This technique helps in reducing power consumption and power dissipation. This paper presents an implementation of ALU based on reversible logic while comparing it to an ALU architecture with the normal logic gates. All the modules are simulated in modelsim SE 6.4c and synthesised using Xilinx ISE 14.5.

These SoCs integrate multi-core processor (i.e., ARM Cortex9 or A15) with variety of memory interface controllers, communication interface controllers and special purpose accelerators. Traditionally bus matrix is used for integrating these intellectual properties - cores (IPs). Bus based architectures are not scalable and consume more area and power, which has fueled design of network on chip (NOC). A customized NOC is further more efficient. In this paper, a methodology for customized NOC architecture is introduced considering various aspects of NOC as well as the SoC. Policies for optimizing Bandwidth requirement, size of the IP (area or gate count), lP location for optimum path lengths are discussed. Policies in turn form methodology for optimum NOC. As IPs in SOC increase in numbers, NOC for interconnecting every IP may result in over networking. Sometimes, performance of router is under utilized. On the other hand, for closely coupled IPs direct port to port connections are suitable than NOC as they communicate heavily. IPs which talk one at a time are grouped together and common local bus architecture is suitable for them. Outside group they talk through NOC. Or routers with less number of ports gives better results. Proper grouping and layout will reduce complexity. Here I am proposing a methodology for handcrafting NOC among intellectual property core groups (IPGs), inside and outside of the groups.

Reducing the rate of bit error in On-chip communication is carried out by error detection and correction codes. But it has its own limitation. So reconfigurable multiple code based system is suitable for heterogeneous system design. But selecting correct code for the correct subsystem or for current requirements involve good decision system design. More over such selection is fuzzy in nature because heterogeneous subsystem demands different combination of input demands. Here, in this paper a fuzzy controller is designed to select correct error control scheme for the current subsystem demand. The fuzzy controller will take user application demand in terms of minimum required bit rate error, maximum time to compute error code or decode on the receiver side and the correlation level of the input dataset. Fuzzified such input by input membership function is processed by the designed fuzzy controller with 27 rules and selects the appropriate coding scheme. One of the main elements under reconfigurable coding scheme is the communication of selected coding scheme at the given time to decoding unit to enable the decoding process. An efficient frame format with less overhead is designed to communicate the selected coding scheme to the receiver subsystem in order to decode the data. The designed fuzzy controller is tested by random input data and the functionality is verified. © 2017 IEEE.","Communication; Error Control; Fuzzy Controller; NoC; SoC","Bit error rate; Communication; Decoding; Errors; Integrated circuit design; Membership functions; Network-on-chip; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Systems analysis; Decision systems; Decoding process; Error control; Error detection and correction codes; Fuzzy controllers; Heterogeneous systems; On chip communication; Reconfigurable; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033782,,,"English","Int.

So the system on chip (SoC) deployed in different topologies with different design parameters to achieve the requirements of the target application. Classical communication methods such as point to point, the bus is not an appropriate solution for future SoCs. That is difficult to send signals starting with one end then onto the next term of a clock cycle. Issues, for example, global wire delay and global synchronization will restrict us.

The dual square waveform can be used in testing PLL as also in other applications in instrumentation. Simulation using CCII+ and discrete passive components show excellent linearity and tunability both by the resistor and capacitor over the bandwidth of interest (from 5 Hz to 200 kHz). Component sensitivity and temperature sensitivity (over -150° C to +150° C) is next studied. Finally an experimental verification of the proposed design has been tried by realizing the circuit with commercially available CFOA (AD 844 AN) which is next best after ASIC-fabrication.

Therefore, a fault-tolerant design has become a key aspect of designing chips to enhance the system reliability. This paper proposes a system-level mapping technique called FTCM, which enhances the performance and communication energy. It emphasizes on core mapping based on the application core graph and spare core placement in non faulty available processing cores because of core failures in the NoC. This technique mainly focuses on the issue of spare core allocation and its impact on the system performance. Experimental results shows that the communication energy conservation in FTCM is 16.8% compared with FASA and 19.2% compared with FARM, performance improvement of FTCM is 12.6% compared with FASA and 14.77% compared with FARM.

Constellation rotation is then applied to maximize coding gain distance. This Weyl group Encoded Transmission (WET-SM) scheme achieves a rate higher than STBC-SM and CIOD based SM diversity schemes, with much less computational complexity.

The concept of PSO is simple and it replicates the nature of bird flocking. As compared with Genetic algorithm (GA), PSO deals with less mathematical operators. Premature convergence and stagnation problem are the two major limitations of PSO technique. CRPSO and ALC-PSO techniques individually have eliminated the disadvantages of the PSO technique. In this article, CRPSO and ALC-PSO are individually employed to optimize the sizes of the MOS transistors to reduce the overall area taken by the circuit while satisfying the design constraints. The results obtained individually from CRPSO and ALC-PSO techniques are validated in SPICE environment.

The efficiency of power conversion can be improved by reducing the number of stages. In this paper, a single stage boost inverter topology fed from PV array is used and connected to a single phase grid. Less number of switching components is used in this topology compared to conventional technique and hence, the converter losses are reduced. This can also be very well extended to utility grid system. Further, the proposed topology includes battery backup unit which consists of a DC-DC converter to overcome the variations of Voltage based Maximum Power Point (VMPP) of PV array because of the variations in solar irradiance. The proposed system uses the current control approach which has zero steady state tracking error to control the single stage boost inverter. The proposed system offers many advantages such as low cost, high efficiency, compactness and high quality of output power.

In this approach, a Berkeley short-channel4 metal oxide field effect transistor (BSIM4, MOSFET) device is loaded in rectangular slotted patch antenna which results in wide band frequency of operation. To understand the design and analysis of low noise amplifier, an equivalent circuit model is extracted from the rectangular slotted patch antenna using finite element method (FEM) simulator where the slotted effect is considered. An extraction of equivalent model from the slotted patch antenna results in the L–C circuit which is used to perform an impedance transformation for low noise amplifier. A 12 GHz low noise amplifier using L–C circuit can improve performance parameters as per designer’s requirement. A reconfigurable MOS loaded slotted patch antenna is verified using momentum microwave simulator and a wide bandwidth of 9 GHz in the frequency range of 10.3–19.3 GHz is achieved. The Low noise amplifier is simulated with TSMC 0.09 µm mixed signal/RF CMOS process technology. The post-layout circuit simulation results show that the proposed common source LNA with L–C network achieves a maximum power gain of 20 dB with the −3 dB bandwidth from the range of 10.3–13.6 GHz.

Recently, the chaotic behavior of the neuron model using non-monotonous Liao’s activation function was described and its design using op-amp was presented. The presented design is a high-voltage one and is not integrable, as both passive resistors and inductors have been employed. Besides, most of the components are of floating type, which are difficult to design on an integrated chip. In addition, only integer-order design has been considered. In this paper, an ultra-low-voltage sinh-domain implementation of the neuron model has been introduced. Moreover, for the first time, the fractional-order implementation of the model has also been presented. The design offers the advantages of: (a) low-voltage implementation, (b) integrable design, (c) resistor and inductor less design, (d) using only grounded components, and (e) low-power design due to the inherent class AB nature of sinh-domain technique. The proper functioning of the model has been verified through different cases where the time constant of the integrator, delay and fractional order have been varied.

In this regard, we propose a framework that takes integer linear programming (ILP) to find an optimal mapping of an application onto such a many-core platform at the task-level of granularity. The optimality is defined within the limits of our ILP model. The proposed framework is not only suitable for an application that can be accommodated on the available cores but also for a larger application (or even multiple applications) that needs more cores than what is provided by the platform. This is achieved by mapping different partitions of the application to the same set of cores and dynamically (during the life time of the application) overlaying a partition on another. The proposed mapping flow integrates scheduling, binding and place and route steps into one mapping process using an ILP formulation. Due to the slowness of ILP solutions, our solution is applicable at design time only. It is implemented using TOMLAB/CPLEX toolbox and we assess its efficacy on a set of 40 synthetic task graphs as well as some multimedia applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Application mapping; FPGA; Many-core; Partial reprogramming","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integer programming; Mapping; Application mapping; ILP formulation; Integer Linear Programming; Many core; Multimedia applications; Multiple applications; Optimal mapping; Partial reprogramming; Computer architecture","Choi, K.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National UniversitySouth Korea; email: kchoi@snu.ac.kr",,"Springer New York LLC",09295585,,DAESF,,"English","Des Autom Embedded Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032485653

However, the addition of functional units in the z -direction has resulted in higher on-chip temperature and appearance of local hotspots on the die. The increase in temperature degrades the performance, lifetime, and reliability, and increases the maintenance cost of 3-D ICs. To keep the heat within an acceptable limit, floorplanning is the widely accepted solution. Proper arrangement of functional units across different layers can lead to uniform thermal distribution in the chip. For systems with high density of elements, few hotspots cannot be eliminated in the floorplanning approach. To overcome, liquid microchannel cooling technology has emerged as an efficient and scalable solution for 3-D NoC. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm combining both floorplanning, and liquid microchannel placement to alleviate the hotspots in high-density systems. A mathematical model is proposed to deal with heat transfer due to diffusion and convention. The proposed approach is independent of topology. Three different topologies: 3-D stacked homogeneous mesh architecture, 3-D stacked heterogeneous mesh architecture, and 3-D stacked ciliated mesh architecture are considered to check the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in hotspot reduction. A thermal comparison is made with and without the proposed thermal management approach for the above architectures considered. It is observed that there is a significant reduction in on-chip temperature when the proposed thermal management approach is applied. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","floorplanning; genetic algorithm; hotspot; liquid channel; Network-on-chip; thermal management","Genetic algorithms; Heat transfer; Liquids; Mesh generation; Microchannels; Network architecture; Network-on-chip; Servers; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Thermal variables control; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Topology; Floor-planning; Heterogeneous integration; Hot spot; Hotspot reductions; Liquid channels; Microchannel cooling; On-chip temperature; Thermal distributions; Integrated circuit design","Dash, R.; Department of Computer Engineering, National Institute of Technology RourkelaIndia; email: ranjita.rakhi@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361241,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we propose a pipeline-design based FPGA implementation of the learning algorithm. The methodology is based on the design of custom processing elements and resource sharing between them for different computational stages in a pipelined fashion. The overall design is implemented on a Virtex-6 ML-605 evaluation platform. Such an implementation results in a rather efficient resource utilisation. © 2017 IEEE.","Field programmable gate arrays; Neural network hardware; Recurrent neural networks; Supervised learning; System identification","Design; Dynamical systems; E-learning; Feedforward neural networks; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Identification (control systems); Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Online systems; Pipelines; Real time control; Recurrent neural networks; Signal receivers; Supervised learning; Systems analysis; Computational architecture; Evaluation platforms; Field-programmable gate array implementations; FPGA implementations; Neural network hardware; Processing elements; Real-time implementations; Resource utilisation; Learning algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

The proposed antenna operates within a frequency spectrum of 2.62GHz to 12.63GHz, which includes the unlicensed band 3.1GHz-10.6GHz approved by FCC in 2002. It achieves a maximal peak gain of 4.85dBi at 9.75GHz and highest radiation efficiency of 95.94% at 3.1GHz. This antenna is mounted on a FR 4 substrate having dimensions 30mm×19mm×1.6mm. This paper initially reports a systematic way of conventional circular planar monopole UWB antenna design and then presents a step-by-step design process to obtain the proposed UWB antenna from the conventional one. In this process transmission line equivalent models for different design steps are also discussed. These models are basically derived from the conventional assumption of copper elements interms of R, L and C. Then after, it reports a comparison study of the two UWB antennas.

The Empirical Wavelet Transform is a method to determine the modes of a given signal by building wavelets that are adapted to the processed signal. Such wavelets are constructed by determining the location of the information in the spectrum of the signal and hence, the segmentation of the Fourier spectrum plays a crucial role in extracting the modes of the signal. However, the Fourier segmentation process is a time consuming process making it difficult to reach real-Time constraints. The proposed design aims to addresses this issue. It utilizes the AMBA AXI-4 STREAM protocol for inter-module communication.

Their ease of accessibility makes them vulnerable to attacks and tampering. Certain scenarios require a QR code to be accessed by a group of users only. This is done by making the QR code cryptographically secure with the help of a password (key) for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key algorithms like AES requires the sender and the receiver to have a shared secret key. However, the whole motive of security fails if the shared key is not secure enough. Therefore, in our design we secure the key, which is a grey image using RSA algorithm. In this paper, FPGA implementation of 1024 bit RSA encryption and decryption is presented. For encryption, computation of modular exponentiation for 1024 bit size with accuracy and efficiency is needed and it is carried out by repeated modular multiplication technique. For decryption, L-R binary approach is used which deploys modular multiplication module. Efficiency in our design is achieved in terms of throughput/area ratio as compared to existing implementations. QR codes security is demonstrated by deploying AES-RSA hybrid design in Xilinx System Generator(XSG). XSG helps in hardware co-simulation and reduces the difficulty in structural design. Further, to ensure efficient encryption of the shared key by RSA, histograms of the images of key before and after encryption are generated and analysed for strength of encryption. © 2017 IEEE.","FPGA; Image security; Modular exponentiation; Modular multiplication; RSA; VHDL; XSG","Codes (symbols); Computer hardware description languages; Efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Structural design; Encryption and decryption; Image security; Modular Exponentiation; Modular Multiplication; Modular multiplication techniques; Rsa encryption and decryptions; Symmetric key algorithms; Xilinx system generators (XSG); Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

The round-trip latency and the volume of traffic through the on-die interconnect between the per-core private cache hierarchy and the shared LLC banks can be significantly large. As a result, optimized private caching is important in such architectures. Traditionally, the private cache hierarchy in these processors treats the private and the shared blocks equally. We, however, observe that elimination of all non-compulsory non-coherence core cache misses to a small subset of shared code and data blocks can save a large fraction of the core requests to the LLC indicating large potential for reducing the interconnect traffic in such architectures. We architect a specialized exclusive per-core private L2 cache which serves as a victim cache for the per-core private L1 cache. The proposed victim cache selectively captures a subset of the L1 cache victims. Our best selective victim caching proposal is driven by an online partitioning of the L1 cache victims based on two distinct features, namely, an estimate of sharing degree and an indirect simple estimate of reuse distance. Our proposal learns the collective reuse probability of the blocks in each partition on-the-fly and decides the victim caching candidates based on these probability estimates. Detailed simulation results on a 128-core system running a selected set of multi-threaded commercial and scientific computing applications show that our best victim cache design proposal at 64 KB capacity, on average, saves 44.1% core cache miss requests sent to the LLC and 10.6% execution cycles compared to a baseline system that has no private L2 cache. In contrast, a traditional 128 KB non-inclusive LRU L2 cache saves 42.2% core cache misses sent to the LLC compared to the same baseline while performing slightly worse than the proposed 64 KB victim cache. In summary, our proposal outperforms the traditional design and enjoys lower interconnect traffic while halving the space investment for the per-core private L2 cache. Further, the savings in core cache misses achieved due to introduction of the proposed victim cache are observed to be only 8% less than an optimal victim cache design at 32 KB and 64 KB capacity points. © 2017 IEEE.","Many-core server processors; Private victim caches; Sharing-aware private caching","Integrated circuit design; Interconnect traffics; Lastlevel caches (LLC); Online partitioning; Probability estimate; Scientific computing applications; Server processors; Sharing-aware private caching; Victim caches; Cache memory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538622544,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

This review paper shows different techniques to increase the gain of the antennas such as use of metamaterial substrate or superstrate. Also substrate materials and feeding techniques of the antenna are varied to reduce the return loss. By changing the thickness of the substrate, bandwidth of the antenna is increased.

While In SPSRAM Bit-cell which consists of Six transistors (6T) bit-cell has single port for read and write operation. By making minimum design changes in SPSRAM architecture we can convert it into PSEUDO SRAM (PSRAM). The performance of PSRAM is limited because write and read operation is done in one cycle and clock cycle time must be long enough to accommodate one write and read operation. So it is difficult to tune the performance of PSRAM. In this proposed methodology we are using the wrapper circuit that is put around SPSRAM architecture to convert it into PSRAM whenever needed. DPSRAM bit-cell area is more because bit-cell is made of 8T hence challenging to make bigger size memory of DPSRAM. PSRAM bit-cell which is made of 6T can be used to make bigger size memory. Also for the same memory capacity PSRAM will have less leakage compared to DPSRAM.

PD measurement helps in condition monitoring of the total power system utilities with minimal expenditure, as it acts as an evidence to fault detection prior to outage. For complex power distribution systems, it is also very essential to locate PD coordinate exactly apart from its measurement, to identify the particular point of disorder. For accurate PD source detection and its localization, UHF signal based non-contact detecting system is proposed in this paper. In this presented work, Micro-strip Patch antenna is used as UHF sensor for detection as well as localization of PDs in HV power apparatus. A pair of sensors is being employed for detection of the same UHF PD signal, placed at different locations. These captured signal pair are then used for estimation of Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) between two sensors by the proposed method, i.e. calculating Joint of Entropy (JE) between the signals. TDOA is further transformed into distance and used for estimation of the PD location by solving non linear equations. The K-means clustering technique is used for identifying the multiple PD sources. The experimental result proves the authenticity and efficacy of the proposed method for detection and localization of PD sources in HV power apparatus. © 2017 IEEE.","High Voltage system; Joint Entropy; K-means clustering; Partial Discharge; Time difference of arrival; UHF sensor","Condition monitoring; Entropy; Fault detection; Microstrip antennas; Partial discharges; Slot antennas; Time difference of arrival; Time of arrival; Detection and localization; High voltage systems; Joint entropy; K-means clustering; K-means clustering techniques; Micro-strip patch antennas; Power distribution system; UHF sensor; Electric power system measurement",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

Experimental results implemented on Virtex-5 FPGA show that the proposed CSLA has nearly 31.65%, 23.37%, 27.15% and 36.97% delay saving compared to HSCG, CONV, BEC and CBL based SQRT CSLAs respectively. All the experiments are carried out for 8-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit size data inputs. A theoretical estimation of adder delay is also done based on the Synopsys Armenia Educational Department (SAED) 90-nm standard cell library datasheet showing the similar results above. © 2017 IEEE.","Carry Select Adder; Delay Optimization; FPGA","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Signal processing; Carry select adders; Delay optimization; Educational departments; Novel architecture; Proposed architectures; Ripple carry adders; Signal processing applications; Theoretical estimation; Adders",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045273,,,"English","Proc.

Many digital systems have been invented to accommodate increased network traffic rate. The overall NIDS efficiency is degraded when the number of intrusions in the database increased. It will lead the demands of concurrent pattern matching scheme in any Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based NIDS system. In this work, a bit based pattern matching algorithm with FSM state transition controller for both parallel processing and assertion based input payload validity check is proposed. Here during the matching process, the Finite State Machine (FSM) state controller will be used in case of early misdetection to optimize overall matching time in case of a longer pattern where the rule is being divided into sub patterns and the successive matches are halted which is done parallel with sub patterns. To avoid synchronization problem over parallel matching process unique controllers are used which is driven with fully integrated page enabled sub groups. The efficiency of FSM state controlled pattern matching process is proved over speed and power metrics. Here in our proposed NIDS system both delay and power are optimized by 5% and 8% accordingly and it is verified using QUARTUS Π EDA tool synthesizer. © 2017 IEEE.","FPGA; FSM; Low Power; NIDS; Parallel processing; SRAM","Controllers; Efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Pattern matching; Static random access storage; Concurrent pattern; Low Power; Malicious attack; NIDS; Parallel processing; Pattern matching algorithms; State controllers; Synchronization problem; Process control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

The important parameters of patch such as L, W, £r and h has its own impact in antenna characteristics. This parametrical impact is studied and verified. As thickness of dielectric substrate increases, the gain &amp; directivity of rectangular microstrip patch antenna decreases and bandwidth increases. As £r increases, the size of the antenna decreases but when height of dielectric substrate increase antenna size also increases. There will be always a compromise between miniaturization and other antenna characteristics. This antenna is designed for microstrip feed line technique and with center frequency (f0) at 4GHz.

Channel parameters such as path loss magnitude, rms delay spread, received signal amplitude and multipath have been analyzed from the measured data. Results and analyses highlight the variation of the channel parameters when the glass is rotated at different angles ranging from 0 to 90 degrees mimicking the movement of a door or window present in an indoor environment. Measurement data is also used in predicting different LOS, partial NLOS and NLOS situations which are dependent on the rotation angle of the glass sheet and also the position of the Tx-Rx antennas. Results indicate higher multipath and rms delay spread for edge scattering in comparison to direct through glass propagation. Path loss magnitude varies by 2 to 4 dB for NLOS scenarios in comparison to LOS scenarios. RMS delay spread values increase by 3 to 5 nsec for NLOS scenarios and multipath components by 10 to 15.

The CM-GSSK transmission scheme allows two antennas to be active during the same time slot, where the information is conveyed only by the transmit-antenna index. In CM-GSSK transmission scheme, each antenna transmits quadrature carriers, whereas conventional generalized space shift keying (GSSK) transmits the same radio frequency carrier pulse. Unlike a traditional linear decorrelator which is designed for MIMO receiver, a low complexity linear decorrelator based decoder for CM-GSSK scheme is presented and its performance is analyzed. At the receiver, the linear decorrelator decouples the received signal, which in turn, it significantly reduces the decoding complexity.

A majority of the work related to the implementation of different arithmetic circuits on FPGAs focusses on the architectural optimization that can be carried out at the top level. While this works well for ASICs, the performance on FPGAs may be degrading due to the poor mapping of the architecture onto the underlying FPGA resources.

The multipliers are technology-optimized by re-structuring the initial Boolean networks and transforming them into an optimized circuit net-list that utilizes the target elements efficiently.

Multipliers are the most area and power consuming elements; therefore, it is desirable to realize a filter with minimum number of multipliers. In this paper, design of comb filters based on lattice wave digital filters (LWDF) structure is proposed to minimize the number of multipliers. The fundamental processing unit employed in LWDF requires only one multiplier. These lattice wave digital comb filters (LWDCFs) are realized using Richards' and transformed first-order and second-order all-pass sections. The resulting structural realizations of LWDCFs exhibit properties such as low coefficient sensitivity, high dynamic range, high overflow level, and low round-off noise. Multiplier coefficients of the proposed structures are implemented with canonic signed digit code (CSDC) technique using shift and add operations leading to multiplierless implementation. This contributes in reduction of number of addition levels which reduces the latency of the critical loop. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform is used for evaluation and testing of the proposed LWDCFs to acquire advantages of the parallelism, low cost, and low power consumption. The implementation of the proposed LWDCFs is accomplished on Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 FPGA devices. By means of examples, it is shown that the implementations of the proposed LWDCFs attain high maximum sampling frequency, reduced hardware, and low power dissipation compared with the existing comb filter structures.

Although high-level behavioral models exist for modeling analog and mixed signal circuits, these comprise many complex differential equations which cannot be realized implicitly using Boolean logic (which is the basic functional block of an FPGA) on an FPGA. So, a more convenient way is explored to map analog circuits into digital domain by converting them into fixed-point architectures because of its advantage of manipulating data with lower word-length. To address the loss of accuracy due to finite word-length effects and limited reconfigurable resources, word-lengths are optimized under the constraint of given performance metrics. The proposed technique built in MATLAB/Simulink environment with Xilinx System Generator support is illustrated with the help of a case study of a peak-current-mode-controlled buck-type switching converter implemented on Xilinx Virtex™-5 FPGA. To illustrate the applicability of this environment for pre-silicon test development, well-accepted fault models are emulated with the help of non-ideal model of a buck converter. The emulation results are seen to be close to that of a post-fabricated power converter in the presence of faults. Experimental results show that FPGA resource utilization can be reduced significantly while achieving the desired performance accuracy under the constraint of multiple error metrics.

The different NW SRAM design configurations (e.g., C 111, C 123, etc., where, C 111 denotes the number of wires in pull-up, access, and pull-down transistors, respectively) are investigated. The read static noise margin and read access time (RAT) are improved up to ∼38% and ∼18% with little pay of WNM by ∼9% (↓), write access time (WAT) ∼33% (↑) in C 112 configuration compared to C 111. Other configuration such as C 113 possess more improvements upto ∼55%, ∼20% in RNM, RAT with WNM (↓∼21%), and WAT (∼44%↑) compare to C 111 at the expense of more layout area. Finally, the impact of geometrical variability including length, radius, and oxide thickness on the read and write stability using N-curve is examined. It is found that the static read and write stability is less susceptible to variability at nominal supply voltage. However, it is very sensitive to the voltage scaling in which read (write) voltage margin varies upto ∼2-3% (∼2.5-4.5%) and read (write) current margin varies upto ∼18% (∼35%) depending upon the design configurations.

Here, we propose a novel approach for the reduction of random-valued impulse noise in images and its hardware implementation on various state-of-the-art FPGAs. The presented algorithm consists of two stages in which the first stage detects whether pixels have been corrupted by impulse noise and the second stage performs a filtering operation on the detected noisy pixels. The human visual system is sensitive to the presence of edges in any image therefore the filtering stage consists of an edge preserving median filter which performs the filtering operation while preserving the underlying fine image features. Experimentally, it has been found that the proposed scheme yields a better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to other existing median-based impulse noise filtering schemes. The algorithm is implemented using the high-level synthesis tool PARO as a highly parallel and deeply pipelined hardware design that simultaneously exploits loop level as well as instruction level parallelism with a very short latency of only few milliseconds for 16 bit images of size 512 × 512 pixels. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","FPGA; Image denoising; Noise detection; Parallel architecture; Random-valued impulse noise","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; High level synthesis; Image acquisition; Image processing; Impulse noise; Median filters; Parallel architectures; Pixels; Program processors; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal to noise ratio; Filtering operations; Hardware accelerators; Hardware implementations; Impulse noise removals; Instruction level parallelism; Noise detection; Peak signal to noise ratio; Random-valued impulse noise; Image denoising","Bhadouria, V.S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: vivek@hotmail.de",,"Springer New York LLC",19398018,,,,"English","J.

An interface is required to communicate between the different tasks. Hence, R3TOS can be used among other functionalities to manage the interface between different tasks on FPGA. Secondly, the speed is increased by introducing a novel architecture for removing the head of line blocking by designing a control unit. This architecture also removes the need for tail flit by including the information about number of data flits in the head flit.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type which satisfies these requirements. But the two main performance parameters of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are near to the ground for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of a patch antenna is 1-2dB. Most straightforward approach of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to generation of surface waves. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antenna with metamaterial on the substrate for multiband application is proposed. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0. The performance parameters analysed are bandwidth, gain and return loss. The proposed antenna design covers UWB range, C, X, Ku, K, Ka and a portion of V band. © 2017 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Gain; Metamaterial; Microstrip antenna; Multiband; Pentagon Shape; Return loss","Antennas; Bandwidth; Dielectric materials; Metamaterial antennas; Metamaterials; Microstrip devices; Microwave antennas; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Surface waves; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Wireless telecommunication systems; Gain; Micro-strip patch antennas; Multiband; Multiband applications; Pentagon Shape; Performance parameters; Return loss; Wireless application; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047406,,,"English","Int.

The process of computing the FFT for large sequence real time data becomes complex and tedious. Hence it is necessary to design a system that can perform the FFT computation of large sequence data with reduced power consumption. This paper presents the design of low power Radix-8 DIT FFT. The proposed design aims at reducing the number of multipliers that are used to compute the FFT. This is achieved by swapping the input terms and reordering them. This leads to a reduction in the number of multipliers used to perform the computation and thereby causing a reduction in the power consumption. This method is highly advantageous when the input signals are lengthy since the number of multipliers used is large in number consuming very high power. In order to optimize the FFT architecture the number of multipliers is reduced thereby causing a significant reduction in power. The prototype for Radix-2 (8 point) and Radix-4 (16 point) optimized FFT is designed, implemented and simulated using Altera ModelSim DE2 EP2C35F672C6 FPGA device.

For any digital logic design the power consumption depends on; Supply voltage, number of transistors incorporated in circuit and scaling ratios of the same. As CMOS technology supports inversion logic designs; NAND & NOR structures are useful for converting any logic equation into physical level design that comprises of PMOS and NMOS transistors. In similar way, logic can be implemented in other styles as well, with the difference in number of transistors required.

SRAM cell is an important candidate in the design of memories and a significant amount of attention is being paid to its design due to the ever increasing demand in data handling. The submicron scaling of conventional CMOS devices affect their performance due to short channel effects and circuits become unreliable. Further below the sub-32nm regime, FinFETs are proposed to be the best possible substitutes for CMOS technology. In this paper, we have designed and analyzed the performance of CMOS and FinFET based 6T SRAM cells at 22nm technology and compared the performance metrics of SRAM cell.

In this paper, we aim to increase the bandwidth of a patch antenna, operating in the X band region of frequency. For the said purpose, we initially synthesize a co-ax fed patch antenna for a solution frequency of 9 GHz. By the variation of three distinct parameters, one at a time, viz the patch length, patch width and feed position, we formulate a relationship between the bandwidth of the antenna and each parameter separately, the other two remaining constant. Thereafter, combining the effects of the three variations simultaneously, we propose a cost function to establish the bandwidth in terms of the net varying parameters. Using this equation and a popular optimization algorithm, viz the Cuckoo Search algorithm, we find the combination of the three concerned parameters which can leadus to have a significant increase over the initially measured bandwidth, thereby achieving optimization. © 2017 IEEE.","Cuckoo Search optimization; Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna with Co-ax feed","Antenna feeders; Bandwidth; Cost functions; Microstrip devices; Microwave antennas; Mobile antennas; Nanotechnology; Optimization; Slot antennas; Bandwidth enhancement; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Fed patch antennas; Micro-strip patch antennas; Mobile communications; Optimization algorithms; Rectangular microstrip patch; Microstrip antennas",,"Taki G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053346,,,"English","Int.

A composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line structure that is comprised of a single unit cell makes up the complete antenna. The design complexity of the proposed antenna is very low, since it does not involve any vias. A symmetric coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure is chosen to have design flexibility and to satisfy the design constraints. The main aim of incorporating the left handed behaviour into the design is to achieve compactness. The resonant frequency of zeroth-order mode is around 5.8GHz. A prototype of the proposed antenna has been fabricated and it has the dimensions of 0.348λo × 0.309λo × 0.033λo. The simulated peak gain of the antenna is found to be 0.65dBi. A significant amount of size reduction is observed in the patch area of proposed structure when compared to a regular patch antenna operating at the same frequency. The metamaterial behaviour has been verified with the help of dispersion diagram and vector electric field plot. Simulation is done so as to plot the reflection coefficient of the presented CPW ZOR antenna and it is also observed on the vector network analyzer (VNA).

The demand for such a high computational requirement is often met by using software methods to accelerate the computation, which is possible only to a certain extent, impairing the feasibility of real-time imaging and diagnosis. In this paper, a new method of using digital signal processors (DSPs) with a specialized pipelined vision processor (PVP) embedded at the hardware level to accelerate the routinely time-consuming imaging computation is proposed and validated. A lab prototype is built for the feasibility study and clinical validation of the proposed technique. This unique architecture of the PVP in a dual-core DSP offers a high-performance accelerated framework along with its large on-chip memory resources, and reduced bandwidth requirement provides as an ideal architecture for reliable medical computational needs.

Researchers prefer reversible logic gates for designing several types of optical switching devices in all-optical communication network. The modern high speed network, based on the conventional irreversible logic gates, faces a serious problem of heat generation due to the bit loss at the output, and the basic reason behind it is the unequal number of inputs and outputs. In case of reversible logic gate, the inputs are directly mapped to the outputs and thus, there is no chance of bit loss. Consequently, generation of heat due to bit loss is not possible ideally. In this article, authors have proposed a new technique for developing all-optical Feynman gate which is a simple two-input two-output reversible logic gate. All-optical circuit has been designed using optical polarization switches (PSW), made of Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA). The working principle is based on the theory of nonlinear polarization rotation of the probe beam in the SOA. Authors have also designed all-optical one bit binary comparator using reversible logic gates. The proposed scheme works on frequency encoded data. As the frequency is the inherent property of the signal, frequency encoded data based logic gates are more preferable for designing arithmetic and logic processor. Simulated results enhance the admissibility of the proposed schemes. © 2017 IEEE.","Binary comparator; Feynman gate; Reversible logic gate; Semiconductor optical amplifier","Bins; Comparator circuits; Comparators (optical); HIgh speed networks; Integrated circuit design; Light amplifiers; Logic gates; Nanotechnology; Optical communication; Optical switches; Polarization; Semiconductor optical amplifiers; All optical communication network; Feynman gate; Low-power consumption; Nonlinear polarization rotation; Optical switching devices; Polarization switches; Reversible logic gates; Two input - two outputs; Computer circuits",,"Taki G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053346,,,"English","Int.

Only a few simulators such as Network Simulator 2 (NS2), NS3 and Qualnet are currently providing directional antenna support. Recently, a directional antenna model has been implemented in Cooja simulator, which we have enhanced further to provide a realistic approach for simulations relying on directional communications. In this paper, we propose a directional antenna suite which also has the features to support smart antennas. The proposed suite allows to load simulation results of desired antenna radiation pattern, simulated using High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) or any other antenna design simulators. The simulations carried out in the proposed suite, to analyze the performance of directional antennas in terms of coverage range, packet delivery ratio and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is in utmost accuracy with the real-time measurements.

To accomplish this, intensive computations are required to be performed. Modern day steganography can be implemented using both software and hardware for the purpose of obscurity based security or Kerckhoffs's principle based Shannon's maxim. The algorithm used in both the implementations may be in spatial or transform domain. Moreover, hardware implementations may be done via a lot of variants among which FPGA (Field Gate Programmable Array) based implementations are most user-friendly and easy to implement and reconfigure. Hardware implementation speeds up the embedding process where as transform domain increases robustness. But the complexity of transform domain is huge compared to the spatial domain.

Here such an antenna is proposed and experimentally studied. Deployment of meandering technique and shorting pins together at the four corners of patch gives less back radiation along with acheiving CP and fairly reduce the size of antenna. Also it can provide inductive and capacitive loading effect to the patch which in turn control the frequency of operation. In this paper, a study is conducted with different shorting strip structures such as rectangle, U-shape, and meandering. Simulations were carried out in HFSS and compared the simulated results with different structures. It is found that meandering technique gives better size reduction than other two because the strongest current strengths concentrates at the meandering shorting strips.

A wall shaped raised ground structure (RGS) is used around the stacked rectangular microstrip patch to widen the beamwidth. A material with very low dielectric constant is used to fill the space left between RGS and two layers of rectangular microstrip patch. Low dielectric constant makes the antenna less dependent on the finite size of ground plane or the host structure due to the absence of higher order modes of surface waves and retains the purity of broad radiation beam. In order to separate radiating patch from its feeding structure and for circular polarization (CP), a crossed slot aperture coupled technique is used. A nozzle shaped conformal radome is used to protect antenna from the environmental hazards and to reduce aerodynamic drag as well.

Here an electronics module for stepper motor cum linear actuator is driven flow control valve using Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is proposed. FPGAs have been shown to provide high computational density and efficiency for many applications by sanctioning circuits to be customized to any area of interest. FPGAs additionally support programmability by sanctioning the circuit to be transmuted at a later time through reconfiguration. The FPGAs can be used for highly parallel system implementation.

Therefore, memory designing with dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) capability is necessary. However, optimizing circuit operation over a wide range of voltage is not easy due to trade-offs of transistor characteristics in low-voltage and high-voltage. Ultra Dynamic Voltage Scaling (UDVS) techniques are used in low voltage levels to minimize the power consumption. Designing memories with DVS capability is gaining more importance since active as well as leakage power can be reduced by voltage scaling. UDVS is to scale the supply voltage by using assists circuits for different modes of the cell operation. In this paper three write assist circuits for reduction in power and 8T cell circuits have been designed. First one is Capacitive W-AC approach to reduce the level of cell supply voltage. Second scheme is Transient Negative Bit-line Voltage write assist scheme for write operation without using any on-chip or off-chip voltage sources and third one is transient negative bit line scheme in which write operation is performed by increasing the strength of SRAM pass transistor. Read operation for reading the data from the cell without altering (destructive read operation) the cell data with low power consumption.

However, the area of mutual coupling amongst large number of antennas in an array is yet to be explored at its fullest extent. This research paper is focused on a particular structure such as polygon to reduce the mutual coupling in an array of two microstrip patch antenna. Two microstrip patch antennas, located on common substrate in close proximity of each other are designed and simulated for the performance of the system. Next, the system is analyzed for mutual coupling. Through repeated design trials and measurement, the mutual coupling is reduced to about 2 dB.

Hardware based random number generators become faster. Field Programming Gate Arrays (FPGA) is one of the most valuable devices in hardware industry. This paper presents multibit linear feedback shift register (LFSR) based PRNGs circuit designed with hardware description languages (HDL). In multibit LFSR system, multiple bits are shift in every clock cycle where a single bit is shift in a conventional LFSR method. This technique is very much applicable in cryptography area. The proposed various bit length multibit LFSR architectures are synthesized using Xilinx ISE 14.7 and Spartan 6 FPGA to target device XC6SLX45.

Here, CMOS two-stage op-amp using nulling resistor compensation circuit is considered for the optimal design by utilizing an improved form of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that is Craziness based Particle Swarm Optimization (CRPSO). The concept of PSO is simple and it replicates the nature of bird flocking. As compared to Genetic algorithm (GA), PSO deals with less mathematical operators. Premature convergence and stagnation problem are the two major limitations of PSO technique. PSO has been already been improved to CRPSO to eliminate the limitations of PSO and is now applied for the optimal design of analog VLSI circuit in this paper. Control parameters of CRPSO are nearly robust and it produces near-global convergence. In this work, CRPSO is used to optimize the sizes of the MOS transistors' to minimize the overall area occupied by the circuit. The results obtained from CRPSO technique are validated with SPICE.

In low power VLSI designs an adaptive filter can obtain a reduction in terms of area and power consumption. A system with a linear transfer function controlled by variable parameters and a means to adjust those parameters according to an optimization algorithm is called adaptive filter. The Least Mean Square (LMS) filter is one of adaptive filters type which is used commonly, because of its simplicity and also because of its satisfactory convergence performance. The current IIR adaptive filter uses LMS to reduce area-delay product and energy-delay product. To reduce this delay one can implement filter in pipelined structure. Shift-add tree efficiently minimizes the critical path and silicon area without increasing the number of adaptation delays. The structure of IIR adaptive filter designing is done by using two main blocks: IIR block and new coefficients block (weights block). Weights block consists of series of partial product generators and shift/add tree. Partial product generators has 2 to 3 decoders and AND/OR cells. Weights block performs multiply accumulate operations. Filter block depends upon on the new filter coefficients obtaining from weights block. The proposed filter is designed in MATLAB (2013a) for its performance characteristics and its constraints are verified using XILINX (verl4.7) implemented on FPGA. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive filter; Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm; Weights block; Xilinx system generator","Adaptive filtering; Artificial intelligence; Bandpass filters; Big data; Forestry; IIR filters; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit testing; Optimization; Power management; Design and implementations; Least mean square algorithms; Linear transfer function; Multiply accumulate operations; Optimization algorithms; Performance characteristics; Weights block; Xilinx system generator; Adaptive filters",,"Niranjan Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063994,,,"English","Proc.

Speech recognition is a technology where the computer understands the word given through speech, rather than using a keyboard. Electronics speech synthesis was developed in 1936 by AT & T, Bell's lab as a research tool. However, the first commercial voice recognition or speech recognition device dates back to 1978 when Texas Instruments introduced the first speech synthesizer in the form of children's toy. The first speech recognition software for computers was PLAINTALK by Apple Computers for Macinosh. Speech recognition is the process of finding a linguistic interpretation of a spoken utterance; typically, this means finding the sequence of words that were spoken. This involves preprocessing the acoustic signals to parameterize it in a more usable and useful form. The input signal must be matched against a stored pattern and then makes a decision of accepting or rejecting a match. No two utterances of the same word or sentence are likely to give rise to the same digital signal. This obvious point not only underlies the difficulty in speech recognition but also means that we able to extract more than just a sequence of words from the signal. When one speaks the same word, the time-length of the word changes in each time. Due to this fact, speech recognition results in error or rejection. Dynamic Time Warping algorithm effectively cures such problems. Adopting DTW algorithm, we can produce a chip having word spotting function at a low cost. We have implemented our project on FPGA which takes its place in the continuing evolution of VLSI circuit technology towards the denser and faster circuits. The complete coding for each and every module was done in VHDL. The work was carried out on Xilinx ISE 14. 1i by Xilinx Synthesis Technology and the target device used was XC 4085 XLA-07-hq304 FPGA. We evaluate the performance of system using several different test sets and observe that, DTW models presented the good results in all cases. © 2017 IEEE.","dynamic time warping; hardware description language; voice recognition","Computer hardware description languages; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Microcomputers; Speech; Speech synthesis; Acoustic signals; Circuit technology; Dynamic time warping; Dynamic time warping algorithms; Performance of systems; Speech recognition softwares; Speech synthesizer; Texas Instruments; Speech recognition",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

The adiabatic logic is a technique, which is used to optimize the power dissipation and the energy recovery capability of these circuits, and this logic makes the VLSI circuits reuse the consumed power. This paper compares different adiabatic SRAM cell structures presented in the literature. Furthermore, the conventional SRAM cell and all the related designs are implemented using FinFET devices aiming at low power operation capability. Methods/Statistical analysis: The SRAM cell design is carried out in Cadence® EDA environment and power and energy values are estimated for the CMOS processes, namely, 180nm and 32nm followed by the 32nm FinFET technology. The two different technology libraries have been employed to identify the effects of the lower technology nodal effect on the power dissipation. The layouts for these SRAM cells have been drawn using Cadence® Assura tool. Findings: The results show that the power consumption of the FinFET based adiabatic SRAM cells (8T and 9T cell structure) is less than the conventional 6T CMOS based SRAM cell. Conclusion/improvement: In this paper, the conventional SRAM cell and the adiabatic SRAM cells with different technology nodes, namely, DSM and UDSM are compared for their power and energy values. The adiabatic logic displays lower power and energy consumption compared to those incurred by the conventional 6T CMOS SRAM cell. Furthermore, the FinFET device based circuits portrays advantages with its better control over the device channel and reduced short channel effects, resulting in reduced leakage power. The FinFET based SRAM cell employing the adiabatic logic incurs the minimum power and energy dissipation. © 2017 IEEE.","6T SRAM Cell; 9T SRAM Cell; Adiabatic Memory; CMOS SRAM; FinFET Memory; Transmission Gate SRAM","Cells; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer circuits; Cytology; Electric losses; Electric power utilization; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; FinFET; Integrated circuit design; T-cells; VLSI circuits; 6t sram cells; FinFET memory; Instantaneous power; Low-power operation; Power and energy consumption; Short-channel effect; SRAM Cell; Transmission gate; Static random access storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

This paper presents an innovative dual band implantable printed monopole antenna proposed for Body Area Network(BAN) that covers the bands as MICS(402-405MHz) and ISM(2.4-2.48GHz). A non-shorted monopole omega structure is acquired to reserve the possibility of application in body channel communication (BCC). The dimensions of the antenna is firstly optimized on the omega-shaped patch (radiating elements) using the multi-path. The longer length (arm) of the patch is considered for MICS band and lower length (arm) of omega structure for ISM bands. The optimization is done by using the two stub-lines on the ground plane to obtain the wide bandwidth and impedance matching. The proposed antenna is designed on a multilayer tissue model and the bandwidths are 39.8 % and 14.1 % at MICS and ISM Bands respectively. The footprint of the proposed antenna is only 0.18λ0 × 0.18λ0 × 0.04λ0. The obtained antenna performance states that the proposed design is suitable for BAN applications. © 2017 IEEE.","band antenna; monopole; on-body; Specific absorption rate (SAR)","Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Biological radiation effects; Crystal structure; Electromagnetic field effects; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Slot antennas; Wearable antennas; Antenna performance; Body area networks; Body channel communications (BCC); monopole; On-body; Printed monopole antennas; Radiating elements; Specific absorption rate; Monopole antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

QPSK is one of the forms of Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation scheme. Generally a conventional QPSK modulator with Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) and arithmetic multiplier separates base band signal into I and Q phase which consumes low throughput with complexity in hardware implementation. Hence to generate high throughput QPSK modulator, the first proposal uses an up and down accumulator for carrier generator instead of DDS and arithmetic multiplier is modified as BOOTH multiplier. The second proposed method will produce the QPSK signal which is based on stored QPSK phase data in ROM which eliminates completely the DDS and multiplier blocks of the modulator. In proposed method-3 the modulator is designed by using Vedic multiplier and carry look-ahead adder(CLA) and demodulator is designed using FIR Low Pass Filter with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). FIR low Pass filter coefficients are generated in MATLAB using rectangular window and hamming window. The whole system has been simulated in Xilinx 14.7 and successfully downloaded on to the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip XC3S400-4pq208 and XC6SLX45 - CSG324.

Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed algorithm analyzes the different stages of instruction decoding such as Instruction fetch module, Decoder module, Execution module and design theory based on 32Bit MIPS RISC Processor. In addition to that the algorithm uses pipelining concept which involves Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execution, Memory and Write Back modules of MIPS RISC processor based on 32Bit MIPS Instruction set in a single clock cycle. Findings: RISC is a processor which is intended to perform a tiny set of operations, to expand the rate (speed) of the processor. In general, the processor works with a huge number of instructions every second by bringing the information from the memory. In the event that the processor speed does not coordinate with memory access speed then hardware interlocks happen. In concurring with this there is one more issue called stalls because of instruction pipelining in the CPU design. The primary desire of this paper is to design and synthesize the MIPS processor by making utilization of register files and to insert the ALU forwarding unit in order to avoid the stalls and hardware interlocks. Application/Improvements: Based on the literature survey, the proposed method brings significant power efficiency improvements with enhanced performance and reduced power dissipation due to not only technology scaling but also a great deal of design efforts. © 2017 IEEE.","ALU forwarding unit; Hazards; Inter locked pipeline stages; Register files","Application specific integrated circuits; Computer hardware; Decoding; Hardware; Hazards; Integrated circuit design; Logic circuits; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Program processors; Reduced instruction set computing; ALU forwarding unit; Instruction fetch; Literature survey; Pipeline stages; Reduced instruction set computers; Register files; Single-clock-cycle; Technology scaling; Computer hardware description languages","Ravi, V.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: ravi.v@vit.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

IEEE 802.11p advocates Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication via Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) between vehicles in the frequency range of 5.9 GHz. Also, IEEE 802.11j proposes the usage of 4.9 GHz frequency range for Wi-Fi. This paper proposes a dual band antenna that is capable of operating in both the WAVE and Wi-Fi bands. This proposed antenna is expected to be simple, easy-to-produce and inexpensive; it can be a cost-effective alternative to use of multiple directional antennas for vehicles. The choice of microstrip patch antenna technology with defected ground structure (DGS) was driven by cost considerations and ease of bulk manufacturing. This omni-directional antenna is expected to be fitted in a central location in the vehicle to avoid requirement of two or more directional antennas.

In 2.3 GHz frequency band, it gives VSWR and axial ratio bandwidth of 9 and 4%, respectively. In the reported work, a detailed explanation about the working of circular polarized antenna in terms patch resonant modes and the equations/design procedure to realize similar antennas at different frequency is not explained. In this paper, an in-depth analysis which explains the effects of unequal lengths U-slot to give circularly polarized response is presented. First the equal lengths of U-slot reduce the resonance frequencies of patch TM01 and TM20 resonant modes. An unequal length in U-slot arms (asymmetrical U-slot) leads to excitation of new resonant mode whose current distribution is similar to TM01 mode of U-slot cut patch. This gives circularly polarized response. Further equations for various patch parameters for U-slot cut antenna are proposed. Using them U-slot cut patch was designed at 1500 MHz. At this frequency antenna yields VSWR and axial ratio bandwidths of 138 (9.6%) and 60 (4.3%) MHz, respectively. Thus proposed equations are useful for designing U-slot cut antenna at any given frequency on thicker air substrate. © 2017 IEEE.","Circularly polarized microstrip Antenna; Higher order mode; Square microstrip antenna; Unequal length U-slot","Antennas; Bandwidth; Circular polarization; Frequency bands; Microwave antennas; Slot antennas; Axial ratio bandwidth; Circular polarized antennas; Circularly polarized microstrip antennas; Current distribution; Higher-order modes; Resonance frequencies; Square microstrip antennas; Unequal length; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043811,,,"English","Int.

The addition of open circuit stub modifies the resonance frequency of second order C-shape patch mode which together with fundamental patch mode yields bandwidth of around 32 MHz (∼4%) on thinner substrate.

Thereafter, these values summed over average number of samples are again compared with the recent energy value to decide whether the spectrum is occupied or unoccupied more accurately. The performance of such technique is evaluated analytically for various decision thresholds. Such evaluations indicate that the some advancements made to the energy detection algorithm has demonstrated improvements in the spectrum sensing accuracy under varying signal to noise ratio (SNR) values. Subsequently, we have shown the benefits of the proposed scheme in increasing the agility of cognitive radio systems. The performance is measured by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves under varying number of levels for different SNR values like: -5 dB, -10 dB, -15 dB and -20 dB. With small tradeoffs between the detection probability and the false alarm probability, the scheme improves the spectrum sensing ability greatly in low SNR situations when tested with 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 samples.

The availability of programmable processors and application specific hardware enables an application architect to partition the execution of the given application code (specified in some high-level language) optimally; so as to execute as large a portion of it, which is timing or performance non-critical, on the processor to lower implementation cost and the timing critical rest, in expensive application specific digital hardware, implemented either as an ASIC or programmed into a FPGA. Profiling tools enables this optimal partitioning by monitoring the execution of the application code running on a processor and capturing different characteristics of the program execution. One of the important aspect that needs to be profiled is the cost of executing functions or subroutines, in terms of both the computational cost, as well as, the communication cost. In this paper we present an efficient, non-intrusive FPGA-based application profiler to address this aspect.

Such multi-standard wireless communication receivers (MWCRs) need filter bank to extract the desired signal of interest from wideband input spectrum and bring it to the baseband for further signal processing tasks such as spectrum sensing, modulation classification, demodulation etc. In MWCRs, rather any wireless receivers, modulated filter banks, such as Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks (DFTFB), are preferred due to their advantages such as lower area, delay and power requirements. To support multi-standard operation, reconfigurable DFTFB (RDFTFB) was proposed by integrating DFTFB with the coefficient decimation method. In this paper, an efficient high speed implementation of RDFTFB on Virtex-7 field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) has been proposed. The proposed approach minimizes the critical path delay between clocked registers thereby leading to significant improvement in the maximum operating frequency of the RDFTFB. Numerically, the proposed implementation leads to 89.7% improvement in the maximum frequency at which RDFTFB can be clocked.

While they offer very high performance, they also increase the design complexity and pose many challenges with one of them being floor-planning and placement. Floor-planning process is affected by and in turn effects physical characteristics, wire length, propagation delay between modules, power and thermal density of the chip. Floor-planning at backend generally takes considerable amount of runtime. With large design space of CMP/SoC designs, it is not possible to explore multiple options or rerun the process in case of discrepancies. In this work, we propose and develop a pre-RTL tool framework that performs floor-planning analysis at early stages of development. The primary goal is to perform floor-plan analysis using abstract description of a design. The tool explores multiple layout options for a design and provide insights into different physical aspects like area, relative position of IPs, thermal and power performance. Since detailed physical information is not required at early stages, it allows us to explore the vast design space of SoCs. The tool is written in python and is based on simulated annealing algorithm which is adapted to the problem's context.

The comparator architectures deviate from the combined Look-Up Table (LUT) and carry chain based implementation which is inferred by the Xilinx Synthesis Tool. The feasibility of this work comes from the increased device density offered by the 6 and 7 series FPGA architectures from Xilinx, where every dual output function derived from a single LUT can be registered using a flip-flop present within the same slice as that of the LUT. Pipelining a tree based architecture completely eliminates the requirement of any synchronization registers for balancing the arrival time of the inputs and outputs, and their associated placement and routing challenges. The architecture has been realized through primitive instantiation of the logic elements to ensure packing of the dual output functions into a single LUT wherever possible, and the placement of the LUTs on the FPGA fabric using appropriate placement constraints.

Decap being in between power and ground distribution networks acts as local charge storage and effectively reduces rapid transients in the supply drop. Therefore, present trends in VLSI design are inclined towards the placement of decoupling capacitors for system on chip (SoC) design. But, early prediction and allocation of decaps at appropriate locations in the pre-layout circuit can only provide a better scope in optimizing power, noise and delay effects for the circuit. The novelty of our work lies in exhaustive module wise estimation of di/dt drop for the complete circuit, followed by an algorithmic estimation and appropriate allocation of decaps with an effort to keep power, delay and noise performance to its best. We choose Double DES as example crypto-core for our test circuits as this is quite complex in nature and are also used as custom cores in many SoC applications. We investigate the change in power, noise and delay parameters with and without the decap allocation for multi-core circuits at the pre-layout stage and find satisfactory suppression of noise at the cost of negligible increase in power and delay. By using our approach, average peak noise and maximum peak noise can be suppressed approximately by 22.7% and 32.23% respectively at the pre-layout stage comparing with the previous works. This early prediction helps in more accurate Computer Aided Design (CAD) implementation at the layout stage. © 2016 IEEE.","Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); Cryptographic algorithm; Power Distribution Network (PDN); Ultra low power","Application specific integrated circuits; Computer aided design; Delay circuits; Drops; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Low power electronics; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; VLSI circuits; Cryptographic algorithms; De-coupling capacitance; Decoupling capacitor; Power distribution network; Proper allocations; Suppression of noise; System on chip design; Ultra low power; Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509014224,,,"English","Int.

Larger designs require numerous Intellectual Properties (IPs) composed of millions of combinational and sequential cells to serve the purpose which further require an extensive web of complex clock tree architecture for effective functionality. But with the increase in complexity, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep track about the clock signal effectively reaching to each intended sequential leaf cell. Clock signal, if gets blocked, can hamper the functionality of that particular IP and the effect, in essence, can further ripples down to broken functionality of the complete design. It is therefore imperative to thoroughly check the design for the locations where clock signal is unavailable in early stages of design implementations. This paper provides an algorithm in form of prototype debugger tool which aims at identifying the root cause of no clock signal reaching the clock pin of sequential cell in single iteration. It moves a step further by looking ahead and detecting all the possible potential blocking reasons, apart from the actual ones within a given clock path to a sequential cell in the same iteration. Experimental results on set top box chip show the effectiveness and the efficiency of this method by capturing all the actual and additional probable clock blocking reasons in a single step. © 2016 IEEE.","Backtrack; Case Analysis; Clock Blocking Sources; Disable-Timing; No-Clock; Static Timing Analysis","Clocks; Electric clocks; Iterative methods; Program debugging; Programmable logic controllers; Set-top boxes; System-on-chip; VLSI circuits; Backtrack; Case analysis; Design complexity; Design implementation; Disable-Timing; Exponential increase; Static timing analysis; System on chips (SoC); Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509014224,,,"English","Int.

The design has lower cycle time allowing SRAM to operate at higher frequencies and hence, more memory can be accessed in a given time. To preserve the data integrity, an optimum port setup time is calculated using best fit curve from regression plots with 95% confidence bounds.

Segmentation of communication channels in such NoCs can (1) reduce worst-case packet routing latencies for FPGA traffic, (2) enable efficient composition of multi-application NoC workloads, and (3) ease the burden of supporting Partial Reconfiguration (PR) for FPGAs. We use segmentation of the NoC links by inserting isolation multiplexers along NoC links to split traffic into different regions. This segmentation reduces routing latencies by localizing the deflected packets to stay within the segmented region. This can be done either statically using configuration bits that can be changed per application phase ≈1000s of cycles or completely dynamically on a per-cycle basis based on packet addresses. For the Xilinx VC709 FPGA board, we build an 8×8 deflection-routed NoC, with 4×4 statically fracturable regions having 256b-wide links with 6% extra LUT resources and no extra pipelining cost to support fracturing while running at >200 MHz. We comprehensively outperform the CONNECT Torus NoC by 2-3× across various traffic patterns while using 4-7× less FPGA resources. When considering real-world traffic extracted from Sniper simulations of multi-processor PARSEC benchmarks, we observe up to 2.7× improvement in throughput for 8×8 NoC with static segmentation. With fully dynamic segmentation applied to large 30×7 NoC with 300b links, hosting a 1,680-core parallel processor, segmenting the NoC into six 5×7 segments uses an additional 1% of device LUTs but improves throughput by as much as 2.5× for LOCAL traffic. © 2017 Ghent University.",,"Computer circuits; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Reconfigurable hardware; Servers; Dynamic segmentation; Large system size; Multi-application; Multi-processors; Parallel processor; Partial reconfiguration; Segmented regions; Static segmentation; Network-on-chip",,"Gohringer D.Stroobandt D.Mentens N.Santambrogio M.Nurmi J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9789090304281,,,"English","Int.

The open-ended hexagonal slot is excited by the asymmetrical feed line in order to obtain circular polarization. The asymmetrical feed along with the open-end assists in exciting the slot to generate the necessary orthogonal modes for the circular polarization, which are equal in magnitude and opposite phase. Furthermore, to the hexagonal slot an open end is introduced at one of its corners. The open-end of the hexagonal slot provides additional perturbations which helps in improving the axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW). A parametric study is performed to improve the antenna performance.

In this study, main attention is paid to improve power quality and tracking performance of a distributed generation (DG) interfacing system under various perturbations. The inherent delay in convergence of conventional repetitive controller (RC) is reduced by introducing a low pass filter in delay line and this configuration is named as modified RC (MRC). By adding an observer with MRC, system states can be reconstructed, which improve the system dynamic response. Robust stability and convergence criterion are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality using combined Lyapunov function and singular value decomposition technique, which determine the suitable parameters of feedback control and state observer gains. By utilizing these gains, the switching signals are generated to operate the DG interfacing inverter effectively. The performance of proposed controller is compared with traditional proportional integral, proportional resonant, and MRC under both normal and fault conditions.

There are many ways to achieve higher throughput. However, if we have additional resources and memory bandwidth available, parallelism can be applied to achieve it. In this work, we have presented two image scanning methods that carry out parallelism to double the throughput of any architecture. Partitioned image scanning method divides the input image into two or more sub-images and then applies the desired filter function on each sub-image in parallel. Adjacent row scanning method provides the input to each filter alternatively, one accessing odd rows and the other even rows of the input image. From the results, it is evident that the resources utilized by partitioned image scanning method are more than that of adjacent row scanning method. The results show that adjacent row scanning method require approximately 20% lesser resources than that required by partitioned image scanning method. © 2017 IEEE.","FPGA; Image Scanning; Latency; Parallelism; Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image processing; Signal processing; Throughput; Filter function; Image scanning; Latency; Memory bandwidths; Parallel images; Parallelism; Real-time image processing; Scanning methods; Scanning",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

Network on Chip (NoC) is a well known scalable communication paradigm to avoid the communication bottleneck in bus based communications. Reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAS) are particularly suited for applications that can be broken into a number of different tasks. Reconfigurability of tasks at runtime enhances the system performance metrics. In earlier literatures, Operating System (OS) was used as the medium, for communication between different tasks at run time. This approach provided significant bottlenecks, as Operating System was using the low bandwidth Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) and Processor Configuration Access Port (PCAP) for communication between tasks and itself. In this paper, a novel NoC structure is used as the communication interface between different tasks. This approach releases the Operating System from managing the inter task communications. This will result in high bandwidth communication between different tasks. A novel architecture router for NoC which has been proposed removes the head of line blocking by using a dedicated head flit first in first out (FIFO) buffer and data flits being stored in different FIFOs for each input port with a control logic dedicated for this operation. It also removes the requirement for tail flit by introducing the number of data flits in the head flit itself. Also, in order to improve reliability level, we incorporate the novel partially reconfigurable Error Detection and Correction techniques in this NoC. This architecture is implemented in Zynq 7000 series. © 2017 IEEE.","NoC; Partial Reconüguration; R3TOS; Routers","Bandwidth; Computer hardware; Computer operating systems; Distributed computer systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; NASA; Network architecture; Network-on-chip; Routers; Servers; Application specific network on chip; Bus-based communication; Communication interface; Error detection and correction; High bandwidth communication; Internal configuration access ports; R3TOS; Real time operating system; Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538634394,,,"English","NASA/ESA Conf.

Additionally, modern FPGAs are equipped with high performance hard-IPs which has reduced the performance gap between ASIC and FPGAs significantly. Dynamically Reconfigurable Look-up-Tables (RLUT) is an advanced feature of modern FPGAs whose content can be updated internally, even during run-time without requiring any bit-stream update. These RLUTs can be used to develop stealthy hardware Trojans with zero overhead payload designs. This phenomenon when combined with an efficient triggering methodology, can lead to the insertion of covert back-doors in cryptographic applications. Furthermore, RLUTs can be deployed for developing customizable S-Box and lightweight S-Box masking schemes. This lightweight S-Box masking scheme when combined with other non-efficient side channel countermeasures (like shuffling) can generate lightweight and efficient side channel countermeasure for lightweight cryptographic applications. Additionally, RLUTs can also be applied to solve long standing problem of FPGA based IP protection. FPGA vendors are making serious efforts for IP protection leading to standardization schemes like IEEE P1735. However, efficient techniques to prevent unauthorized overuse of IP still remain an open question. In this work, we have developed an efficient IP licensing scheme by combining RLUTs with physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and a lightweight cryptographic application. This work summarizes applications of RLUTs for different applications related with FPGA security. It shows applicability of RLUTs for security application on FPGA and its applicability on FPGA security by development of IP licensing protocols. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cryptography; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Internet protocols; Side channel attack; Table lookup; Cryptographic applications; FPGA applications; Implementation platforms; Masking schemes; Performance gaps; Physically unclonable functions; Security application; Standing problems; Hardware security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538617083,,,"English","Int.

MOS current mode logic (MCML) style has emerged as a promising logic style that offers high speed of operation at the expense of acceptable power dissipation. This paper proposes a MCML full adder which employs a load controller circuit. It compares MCML full adder with hybrid-CMOS full adder in terms of various design metrics in superthreshold as well as subthreshold regions. MCML topology with load controller offers a high speed of operation and low power dissipation in superthreshold region. Same circuit arrangement, when operated in subthreshold region also delivers higher operating speed with ultralow power dissipation compared to its hybrid-CMOS counterpart. Power dissipation analysis established MCML based full adder more robust compared to its hybrid-CMOS counterpart. In particular, MCML full adder design achieves 3.77× (2.38×) improvement in propagation delay, 10.43× (3.45×) improvement in average power dissipation, 39.43× (8.21×) lower power-delay product (PDP) and 149.07× (19.55×) improvement in energy-delay product (EDP) in superthreshold (subthreshold) regions of operation at 16-nm technology node. The above results are also validated using TSMC’s industry standard 0.18-μm technology model parameters and a similar trend is observed in the design metrics of the MCML and hybrid-CMOS full adder circuits. In addition, noise performance of the above mentioned circuits is also carried out. It is observed that the noise induced by the hybrid-CMOS full adder is about 14× to that of the MCML full adder. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Adders; CMOS integrated circuits; Delay circuits; Electric frequency control; Electric power systems; Integrated circuit design; Low power electronics; Summing circuits; Timing circuits; Circuit arrangement; Current-mode circuit; Energy delay product; Low-power dissipation; Mos current-mode logic; Power delay product; Sub-threshold regions; Ultralow power application; Electric losses","Guduri, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, MesraIndia; email: manishaguduri@bitmesra.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",09467076,,,,"English","Microsyst Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973121339

The framework is demonstrated through pipelined implementations of two recently proposed adaptive filtering algorithms based on logarithmic cost, namely, least mean logarithmic square (LMLS) and least logarithmic absolute difference (LLAD). To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architectures are the first attempts to implement both LMLS and LLAD algorithms in hardware. We derive error computing algorithms to realize the nonlinear error functions for LMLS and LLAD and map them onto hardware. We also propose a novel variable-α scheme to enhance the original LMLS algorithm and prove its robustness and suitability for VLSI implementations in practical applications. Detailed bit width and error analysis are carried out for the proposed VLSI fixed point implementations. Postlayout implementation results show that with an additional multiplier over conventional least mean square (LMS), 7-dB improvement in steady-state mean square deviation performance can be achieved and with the proposed variable-α scheme, 12-dB improvement can be achieved without compromising the convergence. We will show that LMLS can potentially replace LMS in practical applications, by demonstrating a proof-of-concept by extending the framework to transform domain adaptive filters. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive filters; fixed-point arithmetic; least mean square/fourth (LMS/LMF) algorithm; logarithmic number system (LNS); mean square deviation (MSD)","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Errors; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Number theory; Numbering systems; VLSI circuits; Adaptive filtering algorithms; Fixed-point implementation; Least mean square (LMS); Logarithmic number system; Mean square deviation; Pipelined implementation; Proposed architectures; Transform-domain adaptive filters; Adaptive filtering","Mula, S.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT KharagpurIndia; email: svmula@iitkgp.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10638210,,IEVSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Very Large Scale Integr VLSI Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019965048

The proposed design removes the half-select issue which is a problem in SRAM array as observed in the case of conventional 6T and 8T cells. Since the proposed cell is free from half-select disturb, bit-interleaving scheme can be implemented. A bit-interleaved architecture helps to reduce errors in multiple bits of a single word. This makes the proposed design immune to soft error caused by α particles or high-energy cosmic rays. The proposed cell uses data-dependent stack PMOS switching scheme (DSPS) to reduce the write access time and improve the write-ability. A single-ended read decoupled scheme used to perform read operation enhances the read stability. Various design metrics of the proposed SRAM cell have been compared with previously proposed cells such as SBI9T, DF9T and UDVS10T. The proposed cell shows 1.07×, 2.89× and 13.78× improvement in write access time while writing ‘0’ as compared to the SBI9T, DF9T and UDVS10T, respectively at a VDD of 0.4 V.

The design of single-band pattern reconfigurable antenna is accomplished by the use of varactor diodes with the parasitic elements placed on both sides of the driven conventional printed dipole antenna. By tuning the capacitance of varactor, the antenna operates in four different configurations of radiation pattern which include bi-directional end-fire, broadside, and uni-directional end-fire radiation patterns. The tri-band pattern reconfigurable antenna design is achieved by the use of parasitic elements on both sides of a tri-band driven dipole antenna. Dual-band LC resonators are used as loading elements along the arms of printed dipole to get two lower order modes in addition to the reference dipole mode, resulting in a triband operation of the driven element. The electrical lengths of the parasitic elements with respect to the tri-band driven element are controlled by suitably embedding varactor and PIN diodes with them.

Comparative evaluations with existing bootstrapped driver circuits are reported. Simulation results are derived by HSPICE tool with predictive technology model (PTM) bulk CMOS process fabrication at 32 nm technology node. The ability of large leakage reduction makes this driver superior as compared to active drivers. An average of 96.97% leakage current is saved at nominal ultra-low voltage of 0.15 V.

The antenna resonates at 4.5 GHz when a half wavelength slot section is fed by the coplanar waveguide line. The fundamental resonant frequency is lowered by 2.05 GHz when the slot antenna is loaded with a pair of SRR at the end of the half wavelength slot section. The additional inductive and capacitive reactance of the resonator enables the patch to resonate at lower frequency (2.45 GHz). The proposed antenna structure reduces the resonant frequency with respect to the reference antenna (slot antenna without SRR) by 45.5%, causing the patch to almost reach an electrically small size. Finally, asymmetrical slot has been used and a wide band antenna of band width 900 MHz has been achieved. Despite the loaded patch touching the electrically small limit, the antenna needs no matching networks, offers high efficiency and exhibits a bandwidth better than the unperturbed patch.

Recently, ANN model relating the physical and electromagnetic parameters of the fractal antenna to be designed is used as objective function of the optimization algorithm and it has been shown as an effective approach. In presented paper, ANN ensemble model has been used as the objective function of a PSO algorithm to calculate the optimal dimensions of a circular fractal antenna for desired resonant frequency. It has been established that ANN ensemble has better performance than the constituent ANN models. The design accuracy of the proposed hybrid algorithm is validated through the simulation and experimental results of the designed antenna.

It aims at furnishing a proposed DC gate (DC stands for decoder comparator) to help the construction of these mentioned circuits. Finally, the DC is employed to construct the n-bit reversible decoder. Moreover, a new concept of the quantum equivalent of combined reversible gates is presented by the algorithm. By the comparative outcomes, it is found that the proposed decoder had achieved 25% quantum cost, 66% gate count, and 50% garbage outputs as compared to the counterpart. Further, stuck-At-fault for the single-and multiple-bit input and output is applied to the DC gate for testability.

Over the period of time, researchers have proposed various multiplier designs in order to get high speed. Vedic multiplier is considered as one of the low power multiplier along with high speed as compared with traditional array and booth multipliers. Vedic Multiplier contains a total of sixteen algorithms/sutras for predominantly logical operations. This research focuses on thermal aspects and energy efficiency of wireless communications systems with the thermal aware low power design of Vedic Multiplier. Temperature plays an important role on the performance of any device. The primary purpose of this research is to enhance the thermal stability of the wireless communications. Energy efficient IO standards are used to decrease the power dissipation of Vedic Multiplier and that eventually decrease power dissipation of wireless communications systems. In order to study the effect of different process technology (40, 65, 90 nm) on our design, a novel design is implemented on 40, 65 and 90 nm based FPGA. In this work, we are integrating thermal aware design approach for energy efficient Vedic Multiplier on various FPGA using LVCMOS and HSTL I/O standard. LVCMOS is an acronym for Low Voltage Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor and HSTL is an acronym for High Speed Transceiver Logic. In this Vedic Multiplier, we are using three LVCMOS I/O standard and nine HSTL I/O standard. In order to test the thermal sustainability of our Vedic Multiplier design, we are testing it in three different room temperatures i.e. 20, 30, and 40 °C. Using LVCMOS25, there is 12.99, 19.23 and 10.28% reduction in power dissipation on 90, 65 and 40 nm FPGAs respectively. For LVCMOS25, when our Vedic Multiplier design is migrated from 40 nm design to 90 nm FPGA design, there is 87.72% reduction in power dissipation of Vedic Multiplier when temperature is kept constant at 20 °C. When temperature is scaled down from 50 to 20 °C there is 12.45, 14.93, 12.84, 9.45 and 8.48% saving in power dissipation on using HSTL_I, HSTL_I_12, HSTL_I_18, HSTL_I_DCI and HSTL_I_DCI_18 IO Standard respectively on 90 nm FPGA. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficient wireless communication; FPGA; Green communication; I/O standard; Thermal aware wireless communication; Vedic multiplier","CMOS integrated circuits; Electric losses; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Radio transceivers; Thermal management (electronics); Thermodynamic stability; Wireless telecommunication systems; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Green communications; High-speed transceivers; Low power multipliers; Thermal-aware design; Vedic multipliers; Wireless communications; Wireless communications system; Energy efficiency","Kumar, T.; Indus UniversityPakistan; email: tanesh.nust@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020120847

Index modulation schemes are attractive for their advantages such as good performance, high rates, and hardware simplicity. This paper focuses on index modulation schemes in which multiple transmission entities, namely, antennas, time slots, and RF mirrors, are indexed simultaneously. Recognizing that such multidimensional index modulation schemes encourage sparsity in their transmit signal vectors, we propose efficient signal detection schemes that use compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms. Results show that, for a given rate, improved performance is achieved when the number of indexed transmission entities is increased. We also explore indexing opportunities in load modulation, which is a modulation scheme that offers power efficiency and reduced RF hardware complexity advantages in multiantenna systems. Results show that indexing space and time in load modulated multiantenna systems can achieve improved performance. © 2017 IEEE.","compressive sensing; indexed load modulation; multidimensional hypersphere; Multidimensional index modulation; RF mirrors; signal detection; time slots; transmit antennas; transmit RF chains","Antennas; Compressed sensing; Hardware; Indexing (of information); Information theory; Mirrors; Radio transmission; Signal detection; Slot antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Compressive sensing; Hypersphere; Load modulation; Multidimensional index; Time slots; Transmit antenna; Modulation","Shamasundar, B.; Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052936,,,"English","Inf.

Finite Impulse Response filter is used for extracting the features of EEG waves to detect the P300 event when the patient is in the awakening state. Fisher Linear Discriminator (FLDA) is the classifier used in which the local maximum and local minimum of the signal at each rate of interests were found. To achieve the higher accuracy for processing the brain waves the above algorithms are used. This proposed algorithm is implemented in various devices and compared in terms of area, power and delay. From the result it is concluded that Virtex-5 is best since it consumes 0.67 W and it is able to detect the P300 potential which occurs when the patient becomes conscious within a minimum period of 10ns. The proposed model is implemented in the Virtex-5 FPGA. © 2017 IEEE.","BCI; FPGA; Occipital; P300","Biomedical signal processing; Feature extraction; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Impulse response; Interfaces (computer); Median filters; Medical computing; Fisher linear discriminator; Local minimums; Occipital; P300; Parkinson's disease; Pre-processing algorithms; Real-time environment; Visual stimulus; Brain computer interface",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

Due to higher switching activity during test mode compared to the switching activity during functional mode the power consumption may be higher than functional mode power consumption. The excessive average and instantaneous power requirement during slow speed and high speed test conditions may results in test failure and test escapes due to higher IR drop affecting the yield and the quality of the design.

The objective is to compute test mode power, establish correlation between computed and silicon power consumption data and to analyze IR drop during various test conditions.

The presented research work is divided into three phases. In the initial phase, the intended antenna is designed and analyzed using finite element-based electromagnetic simulator Ansoft HFSS 15.0. In the subsequent phase, the analytical equations of various design parameters are modeled using curve fitting technique in MATLAB and root mean square error-based fitness functions are derived for individual design parameters. Then, a joint cost function is formulated from individual fitness functions for evaluation in optimization algorithm. Adaptive BFO is an improvement in classical BFO algorithm that dynamically adjusts the run-length unit parameter to maintain the balance between exploration–exploitation trade-off. In the final phase, a variation in the adaptive BFO algorithm termed as ‘constrained ABFO’ is projected and designed to suit the bounded constraints imposed by anticipated antenna structure. The modified algorithm is efficaciously used for joint optimization of specific design parameters to transform ‘dual-band performance’ into ‘broadband performance’ for high-speed point-to-point wireless services. The performance of design optimization using constrained ABFO is compared with the original BFO, particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid bacterial foraging–particle swarm optimization (BF-PSO), invasive weed optimization (IWO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) techniques to scrutinize its adequacy. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany","Constrained adaptive bacterial foraging optimization; Coplanar waveguide feed; Curve fitting; Defected ground structure; Microstrip patch antennas","Antenna feeders; Constrained optimization; Coplanar waveguides; Cost functions; Defected ground structures; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Geometry; Mean square error; Microstrip antennas; Microstrip devices; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Slot antennas; Waveguides; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Bacterial foraging optimization; Coplanar waveguide feeds; Electromagnetic simulators; Invasive weed optimization; Micro-strip patch antennas; Optimization algorithms; Root mean square errors; Curve fitting","Gupta, N.India; email: nancy.gupta24@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027341551

Reducing them can greatly boost the energy efficiency but it also leads to increased design challenges. To deal with the activity limitations imposed by the low overdrive voltage and the intrinsic read stability/write margin trade off, large scale SRAM arrays largely rely on assist techniques. These techniques address the problem of preserving the functionality of the 6T SRAM cell by improving the read and write margins of the cell. In this paper, we show a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of some assist methods. This paper presents the margin sensitivity analysis of assist techniques to assess the productiveness of assist methods and to investigate their direct impact on the voltage sensitive yield. In addition, the effect of temperature variation and process variation have also been analyzed. © 2017 IEEE.","Assist Techniques; Read noise margin; SRAM; Static Noise Margin; Write noise margin","Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Sensitivity analysis; Static random access storage; Temperature; Assist Techniques; Comparative analysis; Comprehensive analysis; Effect of temperature; Nano-meter regimes; Read noise margins; Static noise margin; Write noise margins; Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047086,,,"English","Int.

Design errors occur due to functional issues when a unit in a design does not meet its specification. The chances of occurrence of such errors are high when new features are added in a processor. Thus, in multicore architectures, with new features being added in core and uncore components, the task of verifying the functionality independently and in coordination with other units gains significance. Several new techniques are being proposed in the field of functional validation. In this article, we undertake a survey of these techniques to identify areas that need to be addressed for multicore designs. We start with an analysis of design errors in multicore architectures. We then survey different functional validation techniques based on hardware, software, and formal methods and propose a comprehensive taxonomy for each of these approaches. We also perform a critical analysis to identify gaps in existing research and propose new research directions for validation of multicore architectures. © 2017 ACM.","Design errors; Functional validation; Multicore architectures","Errors; Formal methods; Integrated circuit design; Software architecture; Surveys; Critical analysis; Design errors; Development cycle; Fabricated chips; Functional validation; Multicore architectures; Multicore design; Post-silicon validations; Computer architecture",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",03600300,,ACSUE,,"English","ACM Comput Surv",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028673940

It uses a read word-line based body bias controller and two tail transistors in pull-down path to improve the design metrics. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to minimize the leakage current in an SRAM cell while improving the stability and reducing the read/write delays. The above design metrics of the circuit are compared with the conventional 6T, LP10T and WRE8T SRAM cells under process and temperature variations. It is observed that as compared to conventional SRAM, the proposed 9T SRAM architecture (8 × 16 arrays) reduces static power consumption by 98%, improves the read and write stability by 66.07 and 10.51% respectively.

However, secure data communication over the network is a challenging issue because vulnerabilities in the existing security primitives lead to several attacks. The mitigation of these attacks separately adds significant computing burden on the legitimate node. In this paper, we propose a secure IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver design that mitigates multiple attacks simultaneously by using a physical layer encryption approach that reduces the computations at the upper layers. In addition to providing confidentiality and integrity services, the proposed transceiver provides sufficient complexity to various attacks, such as cryptanalysis and traffic analysis attacks. It also significantly improves the lifetime of the node in the presence of a ghost attacker by preventing the legitimate node from processing the bogus messages and hence combats against energy depletion attacks. The simulation results show that a high symbol error rate at the adversary can be achieved using the proposed transceiver without affecting the throughput at the legitimate node. In this paper, we also analyze the hardware complexity by developing an FPGA and ASIC prototype of the proposed transceiver. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Attacks in wireless networks; energy depletion attack; hardware encryption; IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver; phase encryption; physical layer encryption; physical layer security; security in internet of things; traffic analysis attack","Complex networks; Cryptography; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Internet of things; Network layers; Radio transceivers; Standards; Transceivers; Energy depletion; IEEE 802.15.4; Phase encryption; Physical layer security; Physical layers; Traffic analysis attacks; Network security",,,"IEEE Computer Society",00189340,,ITCOB,,"English","IEEE Trans Comput",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028504986

With the passage of time, the leader of the colony becomes old and feeble. This old leader no longer has the capability to lead the colony unless or otherwise it is challenged by a new and young challenger with great deal of enthusiasm. Thus, aging provides opportunities for the other individuals of the colony to challenge the leadership capability of the leader. This natural aging mechanism of the organism has been modelled into particle swarm optimization (PSO) and termed as PSO with aging leader and challenger (ALC-PSO). The main objective of this paper is to efficiently design a high speed symmetric switching CMOS inverter. Here, ALC-PSO is used for the optimal symmetric switching characterization of CMOS inverter. The optimal symmetric switching characterization of ALC-PSO is compared with those of real coded genetic algorithm (RGA), and conventional PSO reported in the recent literature. ALC-PSO based design results are also compared with the SPICE based results.

PV system is one of the best renewable sources of energy. PV inverter is a part of the Photo-Voltaic system which is capable of converting AC current into DC current so that the power produced can be used in household appliances and grids. In this paper SPWM technique is used as a control mechanism of PV inverter, behaviour of different FPGAs at three different frequencies is analysed and a most efficient system is find out. The performance of PV system depends upon many factors like irradiation level, temperature and environment effect. So that maximum power is extracted out of PV system, Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) is used using this output load gets maximum power from the panel. In this paper for control signal generation for PV inverter a digital design of sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) algorithm is used which is designed on VHDL and the design of SPWM algorithm is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA).

Performance of these systems can be evaluated in terms of less power dissipation during their operations. Efficient performance of digital systems has been required with less power dissipation. In CMOS circuits large amount of energy get dissipated in the form of heat during discharging phase. Adiabatic techniques can be used to prevent such losses by supplying the power back to the supply voltage. This paper presents 2×1 MUX adiabatic schematics which are designed and simulated using Microwind and DSCH deigning tools. MUX designs by using PFAL, ECRL, DPCAL and CAL adiabatic logics has been introduced. It is observed that MUX design by using ECRL has shown area efficiency and CAL design has shown the power efficiency as compared to other adiabatic designs.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirements. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antennas with metamaterial on the substrate for UWB application is proposed. Three different dimensions with line feed are analyzed in this paper. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0.

Logic BIST allows in-built chip testing with the help of an additional hardware structure inside the circuit. The test patterns are not applied by ATE but are generated by inbuilt testing circuits. MISR is commonly used as an output response analyzer since it is alternative to n-parallel LFSRs. MISRs accelerates the testing methodology by compacting multi-bit streams into single signature. A Reconfigurable LFSR can be used as the test pattern generator as well as a response compactor inside Logic BIST to improve the fault coverage of IC testing.

The Microstrip antenna is fed by inset feeding technique and studies the effect of antenna dimensions length, width and the substrate parameters dielectric constant, substrate thickness on radiation parameters. The mode of operation is quasi TEM mode because the radiation is distributed in air and dielectric medium. This antenna is useful in applications over a frequency range of 2-4 GHz. The radiation characteristics are stimulated using Comsol Multiphysics 5.0 Software. © 2016 IEEE.","Antenna characteristics; Frequency bands; Micro strip Patch Antenna; TEM mode","Antenna feeders; Dielectric materials; Directional patterns (antenna); Frequency bands; Microwave antennas; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Slot antennas; Antenna characteristics; Design and implementations; Micro-strip patch antennas; Radiation characteristics; Radiation parameters; Structural analysis and designs; Substrate parameters; TEM modes; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

It is based on storing possible filter partial products in a look-up table (LUT) followed by a shiftaccumulation (SA) unit. Usually, all the address location of LUT need to be re-calculated in every iteration. In this paper, we proposed a new strategy for updating the LUT contents without rotation of addresses in successive iterations. This results in a low complexity implementation with high speed. The proposed technique employs random-access memory (RAM) based LUT for storing offset binary coding (OBC) combinations of input samples and filter weights. The savings achieved are significant due to less routing complexity for large order filter. Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis shows that the proposed design occupies lesser area and consumes lesser power and provides higher throughput as compared to existing schemes. For example, a 32 - taps adaptive filter with the proposed technique occupies almost 20 % less area and achieves 12.63 % clock speedup for 2 - taps sub-filter as compared to the best existing scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed Arithmetic (DA); finite impulse response (FIR); least Mean Square (LMS); look-up table (LUT)","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Impulse response; Iterative methods; Logic Synthesis; Random access storage; Table lookup; VLSI circuits; Distributed arithmetic; Finite-impulse response; Least mean square (LMS); LMS adaptive filters; Look up table; Offset-binary coding (OBC); Random access memory; Successive iteration; Adaptive filtering",,"Reis R.Stan M.Huebner M.Voros N.","IEEE Computer Society",21593469,9781509067626,,,"English","Proc.

The one-time payment upfront licensing of IP cores is impractical for FPGA based products, which does not benefit either IP core vendors or product engineering companies. There is a need for good competitive pricing scheme which benefit product development companies and also secure the revenue to IP core vendors. The Pay-per-Device (PPD) pricing model scheme is a suitable pricing scheme. The PPD pricing schemes proposed in the past are complex in terms of communication between different stake holders and inflexible for product development companies to change the FPGA vendor. In this paper, we propose a PPD pricing scheme which overcomes the disadvantages of earlier techniques with better key management and without compromising the security of IP cores. The product development company can change the FPGA vendor at any time in the product life cycle by incorporating the proposed PPD pricing model. The proposed scheme is verified on Xilinx Artix-7 series FPGA. © 2017 IEEE.","FPGA IP core; Hardware Security; IP Rights","Costs; Economics; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware security; Intellectual property core; Product design; Product development; VLSI circuits; Competitive pricing; IP Rights; Key management; Pricing models; Pricing scheme; Product engineering; Product life cycles; Stake holders; Life cycle",,"Reis R.Stan M.Huebner M.Voros N.","IEEE Computer Society",21593469,9781509067626,,,"English","Proc.

Since RF exists at the highest level in cache hierarchy, designing it with memories with high write latency/energy (e.g., spin transfer torque RAM) can lead to large energy loss. In this paper, we present an spin orbit torque RAM (SOT-RAM) based RF design which provides higher energy efficiency than SRAM and STT-RAM RFs while maintaining performance same as that of SRAM RF. To further improve energy efficiency of SOT-RAM based RF, we propose avoiding redundant bit-writes to RF.

A hearing aid is helpful for the people having hearing loss to hear more precisely in both quiet and whirring situations. It helps a person with hearing loss to listen and communicate by making sounds audible and clearer. The technique employed for the design of the filter is Canonic Signed Digit (CSD) representation. The higher sampling rate of the signal is decimated to low sampling rate by implementing the filter using the multirate approach. The main aim of the paper is to analyze and simulate the decimation filter using MATLAB. It is then simulated with ISE and finally implemented on FPGA devices. The two FPGA devices used are Spartan-3E and Virtex 2Pro. The comparison is done on two filter structures, Direct-form FIR and Direct-Form Symmetric FIR, for hardware resource utilization and speed. The hardware result shows that the proposed decimation filter designed on Virtex 2P with Direct Form symmetric structure is 12.79% faster than that designed on Spartan3E.

These may have adverse effect on the reliability issues, timing failures, delays and other related parameters etc. To resolve this problem, we considered matrix synthesis problem (MSP) formulation for VLSI standard cell placement. A coordination game based algorithm has been developed to minimize the heat generated locally (hotspots) on chip.

AURIX (Automotive Real time Integrated NeXt Generation Architecture) is a 32-bit Infineon microcontroller family, targeting the automotive industry in terms of performance and safety. With nearly hundred interfaces, overall cost of silicon validation setup is very huge in terms of number of sensor/slave devices to be connected to micro-controller on validation board and also there are huge challenges in terms of creating stimulus from sensor/slave devices towards micro-controller in lab environment. Creating variety of stimulus is very important to qualify the microcontroller interface protocols for flawless functionality. Another important challenge in using real world sensors/slave devices is, their ability to inject errors on the interface protocol is very limited, if not completely absent. Typically, the protocol errors include bit flip, CRC/parity error, framing error, encoding errors and so on. To overcome the mentioned challenges in automotive microcontroller silicon validation, the proposed solution uses FPGA based protocol/sensor emulation. Usage of generic modules in emulating the protocols drastically reduces cost of FPGA development by increasing reuse of various RTL modules across different protocols. The objective of this approach is to save validation time and also to achieve excellent protocol interface coverage, in terms of protocol functionality testing and error handling, thereby significantly improving the overall validation confidence of automotive micro-controller interface protocols. © 2016 IEEE.","FPGA; protocol emulation","Accident prevention; Automotive industry; Controllers; Errors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Pulse width modulation; Silicon; Systems analysis; Automotive microcontrollers; Different protocols; Error handling; Interface protocol; Overall costs; Protocol functionality; Protocol interfaces; Silicon validations; Microcontrollers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509025411,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

With shrinking nodes the noise margin is reducing and hence it's imperative to have a robust power-grid. Power delivered to each design component in the layout directly impact the component delay, hence efficient power delivery is also an important requirement for the SoC. Current implementation tool's delay models don't take into account the effect of voltage-drop on the delays; hence, impact of voltage drop on performance is known only at the silicon. On the flip-side, over designing of the power grid will lead to routing congestion as well and may lead the increase in the chip area. Currently all the methods for the 'early' power-grid is at the floorplan level, this is still late since, the chip size and area is committed to the customer, making a change here would be expensive and hence undesired. Methodology presented in this paper, with basic technology and design information will provide an optimal seed power-grid for a new design that would be correct by construct to achieve the desired performance goals, at the specification stage. Designer can add power-grid cost as part of the new chip analysis and predict the optimal area to meet the chip power requirements before floorplan stage.

At present, the technology used by diabetics for determining blood glucose concentration is invasive which requires a blood sample and is thus painful. Bloodless and painless technology to monitor blood glycaemic levels could improve the life of diabetes patients. This paper presents the design of microstrip sensor modeled in the form of microstrip antenna, which can be used for non invasive blood glucose monitoring. The approach followed is based on the notion that, variation in concentration of glucose in blood results in the variation in properties (dielectric) of blood which in turn results in the change in near field coupling and electromagnetic transmission of antenna. This will affect the input impedance of antenna and which in turn will affect its resonant frequency. This frequency shift can be used to observe the change in blood's permittivity and conductivity, which will be used to estimate the concentration of glucose in blood. The proposed electromagnetic sensor can be located close to the human skin at a fixed distance in order to avoid perspiration. The microstrip antennas with microstrip feed line and coaxial feed are initially designed using transmission line model and thereafter optimized and validated with simulations using CST microwave suite. © 2017 IEEE.","blood glucose; diabetes mellitus; microstrip antenna; non invasive","Antenna feeders; Glucose; Microstrip antennas; Natural frequencies; Blood glucose; Blood glucose concentration; Blood glucose monitoring; Diabetes mellitus; Electromagnetic sensors; Electromagnetic transmission; non invasive; Transmission line modeling; Blood",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034048,,,"English","Int.

Some of the noises which cause a serious degradation in the image quality are multiplicative noise, salt and pepper noise, impulse noise, gaussian noise, additive noise etc. Among these, salt and pepper noise can be eliminated using median filtering techniques. Sorting techniques have been beneficial for median filtering. In this paper a highly efficient optimized sorting algorithm is implemented for median filter. Median filter is used to calculate the median of set of pixel values of a window. To compare the same column pixel values, data is acquired from FPGA parallely. The adjacent median filter results are saved temporarily using D flip-flops. This method increases the efficiency of execution by reducing the comparisons from 21 to 13 and significantly increases 40% efficiency. Sorting algorithm is implemented using FPGA Spartan 6 LX45.

But due to its intensive operation, it takes more area along with increased power consumption. Hence, a hardware efficient FFT algorithm is a prime requirement. After a survey of various FFT algorithms, because of its pipeline architecture Radix-22 SDF algorithm is chosen as the optimum hardware efficient FFT algorithm. Since the resolution increases with increase in number of samples, a length of 4096 is preferred for the acquisition system (one of the applications of FFT for satellite communication). The system level simulation is performed using MATLAB-Simulink. The algorithm is simulated using HDL programming language. The simulated HDL code is validated using Xilinx ISE synthesizer using Virtex-4 FPGA (XC4VSX35-10FF668). The real time testing of the algorithm is performed with an OFDM system.

Then going on adding the storage disks will not satisfy the user demands, buts it pops many other critical issues for both analysists and clients. The increase in disk size and quantity will increase the cost. It may also decrease the performance of the system. For small and individual personal systems this may become an obstacle. For an individual the patriotic IoT may become an expensive and lazy tool to maintain. This creates lots of problem in their daily life. This creates unwanted and unnecessary troubles in the routine life. The large data can be stored in cloud and can be retrieved from cloud data bases. But dynamic reading and storage is a biggest challenge for embedded systems used in IoT. Because of the network speed, data losses in wireless transport and port synchronization problem the data chunks may not arrive at port stand. This need to be intimated to user with acknowledgement signals. For storing real time data entity high speed data RAMs and internal storage devices are embedded in IoT modules. All operations in IoT system are monitored by a microcontroller contained motherboard. In simple and small IoT systems like personal or an individual systems single microcontroller instead of general purpose is sufficient. To reduce the burden on the microcontroller a co-processor can be used. In the present paper a method is proposed to access the data parameters without intervention of main processor. In this method a Direct Memory controller (DMA) is used to fetch the real parameters. © 2017 IEEE.","Data Fetch; DMA; Embedded System; IOT","Controllers; Electronic data interchange; Embedded systems; Integrated circuit design; Internet of things; Microcontrollers; Random access storage; Virtual storage; Acknowledgement signals; Data Fetch; Design and analysis; Individual systems; Iot architectures; Revolutionary changes; Synchronization problem; Wireless transport; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Their recent evolution has been leveraging advantages such as high channel mobility and increased gate capacitance in short channel regime. The conventional MOSFETS suffer with exponential increase in leakage currents under down scaling whereas the CNTFETS overcome this limitation and deliver optimal voltage current characteristics. Considering the vast amount of data storage requirements in modern day systems, memories act as the vital blocks and they need to be thoroughly investigated with respect area, power and performance constraints before implementation. SRAM cell is one of the important building blocks in design of memories and a significant amount of attention is being paid into its functionality. The submicron scaling of conventional CMOS devices affect their performance due to short channel effects and circuits become unreliable. To overcome its challenges, in this work, MOSFET like ballistic CNTFETs have found to be the best alternatives for conventional CMOS devices under the 32 nm technology regime. The work focuses on the design and evaluation of the performance metrics of CNTFET based 6T SRAM cells at 32nm technology with observation on variation in chirality of the CNT. The design infers that the designed SRAM cell offer a good SNM at a power supply of 1 V, and also a stable read write operation can be achieved due to the high process variation tolerance of CNT. © 2017 IEEE.","6T SRAM-cell; CNTFET; SNM; SWCNT","Capacitance; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Cells; CMOS integrated circuits; Cytology; Digital storage; Integrated circuit design; Leakage currents; MOSFET devices; Nanoelectronics; Nanotubes; 6t sram cells; CNTFET; Conventional MOSFETs; Design and evaluations; Device characterization; Exponential increase; Performance constraints; SWCNT; Static random access storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The wearable antennas are integrated into fabrics and it acts closer to the body hence the back radiations has to be low to prevent human from any harm due to the antennas radiation. Therefore it is necessary to consider the radiation characteristics of the antenna. This paper presents a dual band microstrip patch antenna for wearable applications which operates at 1800MHz and 2.45GHz. The antenna performance is described with integration of Electronic Band Gap (EBG) structure. The microstrip patch antenna and EBG structure are made up of polyester material with a dielectric constant of 1.4 and thickness of 2.85mm. Copper sheets with thickness of 35micron are used as conducting material. The back radiations of the antenna are reduced for both 1800MHz and 2.45GHz respectively after integrating with the EBG structure. The simulated return loss and radiation pattern are presented in this paper for both conditions. The simulated results shows that the radiation characteristics of the proposed design are significantly improved when compared to microstrip patch antenna without EBG.

High performance can only be achieved at the cost of high power dissipation. Nowadays, the use of FPGAs is rapidly increasing due to its low cost and smaller time to market. Today’s high end FPGAs are capable of implementing high performance designs such as transceivers for RF application, signal processing and image processing applications etc. This is only possible due to their complex designs that includes on chip dedicated multipliers, Dual RAM blocks, Ethernet and DCMs etc. Since FPGAs consume large amount of power, it becomes a challenge for the designers to implement low power battery operated communication systems. Several power estimation models are available in literature for early stage power estimation of FPGAs in the synthesis design flow but they provide less accuracy (high percentage error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique. This paper presents the limitation of existing power estimation model proposed by Deng. The given model is converted into a script using MATLAB. The power values estimated from the power model (script) are compared with the high level synthesis tool: Xpower Analyzer targeted to Virtex FPGA. For estimation of power values, an embedded multiplier is synthesized for two different configurations: one with ‘CE’ (low power) and another without ‘CE’ for different I/O vector length. The results suggested that the given low level power estimation models provide less accuracy (high % error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique i.e. with ‘CE’. Further, there is a scope of remodel the existing model for the observed shortcoming. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Embedded multiplier; FPGAs; IP block; MATLAB; Power estimation model","Embedded systems; Frequency multiplying circuits; High level synthesis; Image communication systems; Image processing; MATLAB; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Embedded multiplier; High-performance design; Image processing applications; IP block; Low-power synthesis; Power estimations; Wireless communication system; Wireless telecommunication technologies; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Verma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-62, India; email: gaurav.iitkg@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996554617

ParTejas is a timing simulation engine that gets its execution traces from instrumented binaries using a fast sharedmemory- based mechanism. Subsequently, the waiting threads simulate the execution of multiple pipelines and an elaborate memory system with support for multilevel coherent caches. ParTejas is written in Java and primarily derives its speedups from the use of novel data structures. Specifically, it uses lock-free slot schedulers to design an entity called a parallel port that effectively models the contention at shared resources in the CPU and memory system. Parallel ports remove the need for fine-grained synchronization and allow each thread to use its local clock. Unlike conventional simulators that use barriers for synchronization at epoch boundaries, we use a sophisticated type of barrier, known as a phaser. A phaser allows threads to perform additional work without waiting for other threads to arrive at the barrier. Additionally, we use a host of Java-specific optimizations and use profiling to effectively schedule the threads. With all our optimizations, we demonstrate a speedup of 11.8× for a multi-issue in-order pipeline and 10.9× for an out-of-order pipeline with 64 threads, for a suite of seven Splash2 and Parsec benchmarks. The simulation error is limited to 2% to 4% as compared to strictly sequential simulation. © 2017 ACM.","Architectural simulator; parallel ports; Parallel simulation; ParTejas; phasers; slot scheduling; Tejas","Cache memory; Integrated circuit design; Java programming language; Pipelines; Scheduling; Simulators; Architectural simulators; Parallel port; Parallel simulations; ParTejas; phasers; Slot scheduling; Tejas; Parallel architectures",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",10493301,,ATMCE,,"English","ACM Trans Model Comput Simul",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027396563

In this study, three kinds of user effects on previously proposed antenna are considered, namely, “Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) head and PDA hand (Talk mode)”, “Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) hand (Data mode)”, and “Dual hands (Read mode)”. There are two different positions of the quad band antenna over mobile circuit board is considered i.e., antenna at top position and bottom position of mobile circuit board. In the user proximity, the optimal location of antenna over circuit board is chosen for real application based on the antenna performance parameters i.e. S-parameters, diversity performances, and radiation performances.

Based on the study, it is found that antenna at top position of mobile circuit board shows overall better performance in the presence of user’s body. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Diversity antenna; Long term evolution (LTE); Planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA); User’s body and WiMAX","Antennas; Electric network analysis; Histology; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile antennas; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal digital assistants; Reconfigurable hardware; Scattering parameters; Standards; Tissue; Antenna performance; Diversity antenna; Diversity performance; Personal digital assistants (PDA); Planar inverted-F antenna; Radiation performance; Specific absorption rate; Specific anthropomorphic mannequins; Microstrip antennas","Meshram, M.K.; Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University)India; email: mkmeshram.ece@iitbhu.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994358614

The ever increasing power dissipation is the major problem in CMOS circuits and systems. The reversible computing has potential to overcome this problem and reversible logic circuits serve as the backbone in quantum computing. The reversible computing also offers fault diagnostic features. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanotechnology owing to its unique features like very high operating frequency, extremely low power dissipation, and nanoscale feature size is emerging as a promising candidate to replace CMOS technology. This paper presents design and performance analysis of area efficient QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin universal reversible logic gates. The proposed designs of QCA reversible Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin reversible gates utilize 39.62, 21.05, and 24.74% less number of QCA cells as compared to previous best designs. The rectangular layout area of proposed QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin gates are 52, 28.10, and 40.23%, respectively less than previous best designs. The optimized designs are realized employing 5-input majority gates to make proposed designs more compact and area efficient. The major advantage is that the optimized layouts of reversible gates did not utilize any rotated, translated QCA cells, and offer single layer accessibility to their inputs and outputs. The proposed efficient layouts did not employ any coplanar or multi-layer wire crossovers. The energy dissipation results have been computed for proposed area efficient reversible gates and thermal layouts are generated using accurate QCAPro power estimator tool. The functionality of presented designs has been performed in QCADesigner version 2.0.3 tool. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CMOS; Feynman gate; Fredkin gate; QCA; Toffoli gate","Cellular automata; CMOS integrated circuits; Computation theory; Electric losses; Energy dissipation; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Nanotechnology; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Feynman gate; Fredkin gate; High operating frequency; Low-power dissipation; Quantum-dot cellular automata; Reversible logic circuits; Reversible logic gates; Toffoli gates; Computer circuits","Singh, G.; Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)India; email: gurmohan@cdac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01419331,,MIMID,,"English","Microprocessors Microsyst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019971150

Mobile devices are equipped with a processing element that is responsible for performing all the controlling and computational tasks. Most of the computational tasks inside the processing element are performed by ALU circuit. ALU is considered as the computational engine and responsible for high power consumption. Previously, microprocessors and microcontrollers were the choice of designers but nowadays the horizon has been shifted to FPGAs and SOCs as a processing element in mobile devices. Obviously, FPGAs have numerous advantages over processors and the growing need of applications compels the designers to use FPGAs for fast processing. Although FPGAs fulfils the requirement of designers but they suffer from the disadvantage of high power consumption due to their complex circuitry. The demand of high performance and low power devices creates a bottleneck in front of designers specifically for battery operated portable wireless devices. So, this paper presents some power minimization techniques that can be applied on communication centric designs targeted to FPGAs. There are different techniques given in the literature but most of them are applied at device level only. This paper gives an insight to minimize the power at architectural level of design hierarchy using XPower Analyzer as a CAD tool. The proposed techniques are applied on arithmetic and logical unit circuit for analysis purpose, as ALU is the heart of processing elements used in portable wireless devices. The circuit has been verified and realized on XILINX ISE directed to Spartan 3E XC3S250E FPGA. The analysis illustrates significant improvement in the power consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficient ALU; FPGA; Parallelism; Pipelining; Portable devices; SOC","Computational methods; Computer aided design; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Logic circuits; Pipe linings; Radio; Systems analysis; Architectural levels; Energy efficient; High power consumption; Low-power consumption; Parallelism; Portable device; Portable wireless device; Processing elements; System-on-chip","Verma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-62, India; email: gaurav.iitkg@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995743370

Three different FPGA and SOC are taken under consideration and our design is implemented on these four ICs and we find the most energy efficient architecture and also find the architecture that will deliver highest performance among these four architectures taken under consideration.

However, the use of remote DPR brings with it a number of security threats that could lead to potentially catastrophic consequences in practical scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate four examples where the remote DPR capability of the FPGA may be exploited by an adversary to launch Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) attacks on commonly used security applications. We substantiate the threat by demonstrating remotely-launched attacks on Xilinx FPGA-based hardware implementations of a cryptographic algorithm, a true random number generator, and two processor based security applications - namely, a software implementation of a cryptographic algorithm and a cash dispensing scheme. The attacks are launched by on-the-fly transfer of malicious FPGA configuration bitstreams over an Ethernet connection to perform DPR and leak sensitive information.

Due to these factors or capabilities, patch antennas are able to overcome the rising demands in the field of wireless communication like high gain, high power, maximized throughput and low losses. Metamaterials are the synthetic materials that are engineered to have some exclusive properties those are not found in any naturally existing materials. These materials possess their properties due to their structure and not because of the material they are composed of. The stacking of patch antennas i.e. The use of one patch over other is an effective method to improve their performance for the dual frequency and broadband operation which is required in most of the high frequency wireless applications. The closure between the two conducting surfaces subjected to an excitation will lead to a strong mutual coupling between them. This is the reason for the bandwidth enhancement and the use of it for operation at multiple frequencies. The objective of the work presented in the paper is to study the performance of the patch antenna by stacking its dielectric with a metamaterial. The paper presents a theoretical study of the use of metamaterial superstrates to improve the performance of patch antennas. The output parameters of patch antenna without and with the metamaterial superstrate were obtained using MATLAB and their comparison is done to understand the effect of the metamaterial when it is used in a patch antenna. © 2016 IEEE.","enhanced performance etc; high frequency; metamaterial superstrates; Micrsostrip; patch antenna; wireless applications","Antennas; MATLAB; Metamaterial antennas; Metamaterials; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Structure (composition); Wireless telecommunication systems; enhanced performance etc; High frequency HF; Micrsostrip; Superstrates; Wireless application; Microstrip antennas","Mahamuni, C.V.; Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Fr.

In fixed-value impulse noise, the gray value is a fixed value, i.e., either 0 or 255 (example: Salt and pepper noise). Digital signal processing frequently involves some method for noise reduction over an image. The median filter is a non-linear digital filter, which is most popularly used to remove impulse noises. Many popular algorithms were presented which eliminates impulse noises present and maintains the fine details of the image. But, median filter fails to preserves the edges of the image by uniform modification of the noise affected pixels and the noise-free pixels. Also, the conventional filters work better only over images affected with low noise ratios and is very poor when the noise ratio reaches above 40%. The proposed de-noising algorithm uses an adaptive Gaussian filters for removal of salt and pepper noise. As conventional de-noising algorithm fails at high noise density and in preserving edges along with image details the proposed technique switches between mask sizes depending noise density. To preserve edges and details of the image Adaptive threshold is employed. Advantage of adaptive threshold filtering does not affect the edges or other small structures in the image. Hence this method is more efficient for the images with very high noise ratio and preserving edges. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive Gaussian filters; Salt and Pepper noise; System generator; Xilinx ISE","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gaussian distribution; Image acquisition; Image processing; Impulse noise; Integrated circuit design; Median filters; Optimization; Pixels; Pulse shaping circuits; Salt removal; Signal processing; Adaptive threshold filtering; De-noising algorithm; Design and implementations; Fixed-value impulse noise; Gaussian filters; Salt-and-pepper noise; System Generator; Xilinx ISE; Edge detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046973,,,"English","Int.

Owing to a fast and tensed life style, there is a drastic increase in the number and intensity of diseases which call for intense investigation. The digitization of large medical images like x-ray, Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) demands large disk storage space. Even with sufficient storage facilities, hospitals face difficulties with regard to storage of data. Numerous image compression methods have been developed to address the problem of storage space and to help the doctors in the analysis of patient's ailments more accurately and reliably. There are different lossless and lossy compression techniques. Joing Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) and Fractal Image Compression (FIC) are examples of lossy compression. FIC is gaining importance in the recent years. FIC is characterized by long encoding time and high Compression Ratio (CR). Further as medical images being voluminous, a high CR is required to reduce the storage space. Fractal Image compression adopts affine transforms to map the range blocks and domain blocks by using the property of self similarity in the images In view of this, the present paper aims in providing a comparative analysis of the different approaches for performing FIC applied on medical images (MR of brain, Mammograms(MG), ultrasound of uterus and CT of bone) to achieve high CR by still retaining the quality of the image. The results have shown a that FIC takes less encoding time when implemented on FPGA than using MATLAB. © 2016 IEEE.","FPGA; Fractal Theory; Iterated Function systems; PSNR; Quad-tree; Range blocks","Affine transforms; Computerized tomography; Digital storage; Encoding (symbols); Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Fractals; Image analysis; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic storage; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Quality control; Fractal theory; Iterated function system; PSNR; Quad trees; Range block; Image compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046973,,,"English","Int.

In sharp contrast to digital technology where Moore's law reigns, a fundamental law of physics constrains the ability to realize electrically small antennas that are both efficient and broadband. Software defined radio is defined as a radio in which some or all of their functions are software defined. The use of SDRs to make communications has enabled the design of intelligent radios called as Cognitive radio(CRs), by making communications re-configurable at lower layers of the networking stack. The major challenge is to design small antennas which can be operated at the large number of frequency bands. By tuning/switching the resonant frequency, single antenna can operate at different band of frequencies. In this paper a simulation study of a slot loaded RMSA with has been done to verify the dual band operation at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz. © 2016 IEEE.","CR; Primary User; SDR; Secondary User; Spectrum Hole","Antennas; Chromium; Cognitive radio; Embedded systems; Frequency bands; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Natural frequencies; Network layers; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Digital technologies; Electrically small antennas; Electronically tunable; Primary Users; Secondary users; Software-defined radios; Spectrum holes; Wireless communication system; Software radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

Studies claim that there will be the existence of billions of internet connected devices in coming years. The small size and limited processing power of many connected devices could inhibit encryption and other robust security measure. Here cryptography plays a pivotal role. Also most of the devices available in the market today are resource constrained. Hence cryptographic solutions must be easy to implement and have high performance on a wide range of severely constrained devices. The relatively new field of lightweight cryptography provides significant advantages over existing algorithms when addressing security issues for highly constrained devices. In this project a detailed study of LBlock block cipher is done which is a lightweight cipher in both hardware and 8-bit platforms and an IP core is developed. The block size of LBlock is 64-bit and the key size is 80-bit and it can achieve competitive hardware and software performances when compared with other known lightweight block ciphers. The security evaluation shows that LBlock can achieve enough security margin against known attacks such as differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, impossible differential cryptanalysis and related-key attacks etc. LBlock cryptocore is designed, build and characterized for the efficient implementation in low resource devices. It can serve as a benchmark for the hardware design engineers to model devices that utilizes lightweight characteristics. LBlock cipher is implemented on Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA (XC6LX16-CS324) and its performance metrics were obtained. © 2016 IEEE.","Cryptography; Internet of things; LBlock; Lightweight cryptography; Performance metrics; Xilinx","Embedded systems; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Internet of things; Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Signal processing; Differential cryptanalysis; Efficient implementation; Impossible differential cryptanalysis; LBlock; Light-weight cryptography; Lightweight block ciphers; Performance metrics; Xilinx; Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

The use of electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures is a good way to reduce the excitation of surface waves in geometries of printed antenna in order to alleviate the problem of mutual coupling. This paper examines the performance of a microstrip antenna integrated phased array in an EBG. A novel EBG array configuration is proposed, the bandgap characteristic of mushroom-like EBG has been studied, its spacing of characteristic band of the deletion of the surface wave is demonstrated by plotting the variations of the transmission coefficient S12 with the frequency and scatter diagram. The design of the antenna is verified by High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS), the simulation HFSS results show that the design approach EBG is a good candidate for a reduction of mutual coupling to certain frequencies between elements of the radiator, which in turn increases the directivity of the antenna. © 2016 IEEE.","Antenna arrays; Electromagnetic band gap structures(EBG); Multiple input Multiple output (MIMO); Mutual coupling reduction; Reflection phase; Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)","Antenna arrays; Antenna phased arrays; Antennas; Electric excitation; Embedded systems; Energy gap; MIMO systems; Radar antennas; Radar signal processing; Signal processing; Surface waves; Synthetic aperture radar; Array configurations; Characteristic bands; Design approaches; Electromagnetic bandgap structures; Mutual coupling reductions; Reflection phase; Specific absorption rate; Transmission coefficients; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

In this paper the plaintext is first divided into number of blocks and each block are first encrypted by Recursive Positional Substitution on Prime-Nonprime of Cluster (RPSPNC) and then the resultant blocks are encrypted by Triangular Encryption (TE). In RPSPNC source stream is divided into blocks and a generating function is applied on each block to generate a same size of intermediate block t, repetition of this generating function for finite number of time regenerates the original block. In TE, source stream is broken into blocks of size n, and then XNOR operation is performed from MSB to LSB generating a block of size n − 1 and continues to form a triangle. Encryption is done in any of four types and decryption is done in similar method. Lastly combining all the encrypted blocks the ciphertext is generated. Thus applying cascaded approach much better result has been generated as compared to separate RPSPNC and TE.

The antenna realizes complete azimuthal beam scanning with a maximum elevation angle of 34°. This antenna consists of a central driven element and four hexagonal slotted tunable parasitic patches placed on each side of the driven element. The effective electrical size of the parasitic element is changed with respect to the driven element, by varying the capacitance of varactor diodes loaded in the hexagonal slot. The reflector and director properties of the tunable parasitic elements are used to tilt the main beam of antenna away from the broadside direction. The antenna achieves continuous beam scanning from θ = 0° to 34° for π = 45°, 90°, 135°, 225°, 270° and 315° planes. The advantage of the antenna is that the design is simple and it maintains a common impedance bandwidth from 2.42-2.47 GHz in all configurations. The two-dimensional beam scanning capability of the proposed antenna can be effectively used in the next generation wireless communication networks. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Antennas; Electric impedance; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Scanning; Slot antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Beam scanning capabilities; Continuous beams; Elevation angle; Impedance bandwidths; Next-generation wireless communications; Parasitic element; Parasitic patch; Varactor diodes; Scanning antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The system is designed in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in order to provide maximum flexibility in implementation. The design of the system consists of three major components namely, VLC front end, FPGA physical layer and firmware design and MIL-STD-1553 MAC design. The designed VLC front end achieves up to 16 Mbps speed and distance of separation of 4.5m with low cost of the self LED and photodetector components. Furthermore, a design architecture of MIL-STD-1553 based wireless VLC system is proposed which is a promising candidate for wireless avionics communications. A modification of traditional wired bus MIL-STD-1553 signaling is proposed for use with wireless VLC system and subsequently implemented in FPGA-based hardware for real-time evaluation. The entire physical layer, firmware and MAC layer are implemented in FPGA-based Xilinx's Zynq System on Chip (SoC) hardware. The design of the system is shown to have very minimal resource requirements when implemented in hardware. The real-time over-the-air performance results are obtained using over-the-air transmission and reception of data traffic through the testbed using On-Off-Keying (OOK) with Line of Sight (LOS) and SISO configuration. Finally, a small scale demonstrable experimental test setup consisting of three nodes (one BC and two RTs) is presented in this paper which is an early prototype of an OnBoard Data Handling (OBDH) in the satellite. © 2016 IEEE.","FPGA; Hardware Implementation; MIL-STD-1553; OBDH; Testbed; VLC","Data handling; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Firmware; Hardware; Light; Network layers; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Testbeds; Visible light communication; Hardware implementations; MIL-STD-1553; OBDH; Onboard data handling; Real time evaluation; Resource requirements; System on chips (SoC); Visible light communications (VLC); Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirement. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. This paper presents pentagon shape patch antenna with probe feed for three different dimensions.

The main motive behind the development of the architecture is on giving efficient hardware utilization along with high operating speed and less number of clock cycles. To verify the proposed scheme, 2D DWT is applied on a grey image of size 128∗128 to get all the four components (average, diagonal, horizontal and vertical), this wavelet decomposition is verified and obtained in Xilinx 14.2 version software using Verilog HDL; circuit is planned, modelled (simulated) in Verilog HDL, and finally the result is validated in FPGA Spartan 6 to get the output 2D-DWT computed image back. This is a single chip implementation where discrete wavelet transform can be used in VLSI design more efficiently than other transform. It is depicted that the operation carried out with specified processing speed of the designed architecture based on the proposed scheme is good than those of the other architectures designed using other existing schemes, and it has less hardware utilization. © 2016 IEEE.","2D - discrete wavelet transform; FPGA; HDL; VLSI architecture","Computer hardware; Computer hardware description languages; Discrete wavelet transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Integrated circuit design; VLSI circuits; Wavelet decomposition; 2-d discrete wavelet transforms; Architecture-based; FPGA implementations; Hardware utilization; High-speed computation; Number of clock cycles; Processing speed; VLSI architectures; Wavelet transforms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036622,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Currently we are developing a Small Organ Imaging Gamma Camera (SOIGC) for imaging small organs with higher spatial and energy resolution. We present here a novel 'SoC' based real-time medical image processing tool for evaluation and quantification of Thyroid Uptake Ratio derived from Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).The Thyroid Uptake Ratio is a diagnostic index used extensively to assess Thyroid's hormonal activity obtained by quantifying the intensity of the segmented SPECT images which are conventionally done on expensive propriety tools. In contrast to these, our lower cost SoC tool based on DSP architecture offers a higher speed image segmentation process with co-relating performance. Thus, it also eliminates the need for higher computing resources on the host machine by using a Hardware accelerator called 'Pipeline Vision Processor' of an optimized Dual Core Digital Signal Processor. This architecture offers a high performance enhanced infrastructure with large on-chip memory and reduces the overall bandwidth requirement leading to accelerated imaging. We have cross-validated the performance of this tool by evaluating 27 medical case studies with thyroid medical history. As compared to diagnosis by propriety SIEMENS software or segmentation tools based on MATLAB, our hardware accelerated approach has shown a drastic reduction of computational time of about 250% with superior correlation. This SoC tool can be extended and realized for various other Medical Imaging procedures like Kidney's Glomerular Filtration Rate and Myocardial Perfusion studies of Heart. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital Signal Processing (DSP); Medical Imaging; Pipelined Vision Processor (PVP); System on Chip (SoC)","Biomedical equipment; Computer hardware; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Hardware; Image processing; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Pipeline processing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; Single photon emission computed tomography; System-on-chip; Bandwidth requirement; Computational resources; Digital signal processing (DSP); Glomerular filtration rate; Hardware accelerators; Image segmentation process; System on chips (SoC); Vision processor; Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036622,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Complex functions can be implemented using only two transistors by using this method. GDI technique allows for reduced power consumption, lower delay, lesser transistor count and decreased area of circuits. It also makes the system design less complex. Full adders and parallel adders, are major building blocks of different digital components like ALUs, DSPs etc. Hence, reducing power consumption of adders is very important. This work aims at building a parallel adder that consumes less power. A GDI based XOR gate is designed using which, a 10T full adder is designed which involves lesser number of devices compared to CMOS Full adder. The threshold loss in full adder is a major pitfall. A standard CMOS process compatible version of GDI cell, modified GDI, mGDI cell is proposed, using which a full adder is built. A 4-bit parallel adder is designed. The proposed technique consumes lesser area and has low power dissipation compared to CMOS design. Power consumption is reduced by 15% compared to CMOS design.

First the AMBA-AHB is modeled using 3 masters and 4 slaves in verilog language. This design is then verified using SVA binding construct in ModelSim. Binding allows verification engineers to add assertions to design without touching the design files. The different properties of AMBA-AHB and its corner cases properties are verified using ModelSim and the total coverage report of the design is calculated.

For an application, input to the current work is a gridded floorplan having fixed positions of cores and routers in it. Maximum physical link length between two routers has been taken as a constraint. For each edge in the application core graph, the proposed method selects a particular path amongst all possible paths, between two grid points. A set of paths is constructed, corresponding to each edge in the core graph, to minimize either the average packet latency or the total router power consumption of the network. The work also inserts junction routers at the intersection of two paths. Secondary routers or repeaters are inserted on a long link, to sustain a pre-specified maximum link length constraint. Alternative paths between routers requiring communication have been generated using a heuristic algorithm. From this, the path synthesis problem has been formulated using a set of linear equations. A Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) based solution has also been proposed for the problem. The path synthesis methodology has been tested with benchmark applications and compared with the shortest path based greedy approaches used by the other ASNoC synthesis methods. The results show a significant improvement in average packet latency and throughput. A power calculator has been developed that computes router power consumption as a function of traffic-load on the router and its number of input and output ports. With the help of the proposed power calculator, a power-aware path synthesis has been accomplished. Synthesized networks have been compared with the networks generated using the shortest path based methods. The proposed method consumes significantly less dynamic power compared to such greedy methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Application-Specific Network-on-Chip; Communication Cost; Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization; Floorplan-aware synthesis; Integer Linear Programming; NoC synthesis","Benchmarking; Computer systems programming; Electric power utilization; Graph theory; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Low power electronics; Mathematical instruments; Network-on-chip; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power management; Routers; Servers; Application specific network on chip; Communication cost; Discrete particle swarm optimization; Floorplans; Integer Linear Programming; Noc synthesis; Integrated circuit design","Mukherjee, P.",,"Elsevier B.V.",01679260,,IVJOD,,"English","Integr VLSI J",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018753597

In order to reduce subthreshold leakage current, the threshold voltage of NMOS access and driver transistors are adjusted to a high value by applying a reverse body-bias. On the other hand, forward body-bias lowers the threshold voltage of NMOS access transistor thereby enabling faster read and writes operation. Simulation results shows that the proposed design is much better than conventional and other SRAM cells such as, NC SRAM, PP SRAM, WRE8T. The amount of leakage power reduction is as high as 41.071 % over conventional 6T SRAM cell when tested on (8 × 16) SRAM array. Whereas, the improvement in read and write delay is 30 and 15.81 % respectively. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Body biasing controller; High speed and stability; Leakage power dissipation; SRAM; Sub threshold leakage current; Word line signal","Bias voltage; Controllers; Integrated circuit design; Leakage currents; Static random access storage; Timing circuits; Body biasing; Dynamic threshold; Forward body bias; High Speed; Leakage power dissipations; Leakage power reduction; Reverse body bias; Sub-threshold leakage currents; Threshold voltage","Lorenzo, R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology SilcharIndia; email: rohit.lorenzo@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989181287

For analog ICs, active loads and current mirrors serve as supporting components. Hence, the use of fixator-norator pairs may abbreviate as defining the dynamic and static resistance of active loads and current mirrors that should be affirmative with a given design.

However, the challenges in the implementation of floating point arithmetic on FPGA are that, the hardware modules are larger, have longer latency and high power consumption. In this work, a novel efficient reversible floating point fused arithmetic unit architecture is proposed confirming to IEEE 754 standard. By utilizing reversible logic circuits and implementation with adiabatic logic, power efficiency is achieved. The hardware complexity is reduced by employing fused elements and latency is improved by decomposing the operands in the realization of floating point multiplier and square root. To validate the design, the proposed unit was used for realization of FFT and FIR filter which are important applications of a DSP processor. As detection is one of the core baseband processing operations in digital communication receivers and the detection speed determines the data rates that can be achieved, the proposed unit has been used to implement the detection function. Simulation results and comparative studies with existing works demonstrate that the proposed unit efficiently utilizes the number of gates, has reduced quantum cost and produced less garbage outputs with low latency, thereby making the design a computational and power efficient one. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Reversible design for DSP; Reversible floating point arithmetic unit; Reversible MAC unit","Computer circuits; Digital arithmetic; Digital communication systems; Digital signal processing; FIR filters; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Program processors; Real time systems; Signal processing; Base-band processing; Comparative studies; Digital communications; High power consumption; Real-time signal processing; Reversible design for DSP; Reversible logic circuits; Reversible MAC unit; Computer architecture","AnanthaLakshmi, A.V.email: anantha_av@pec.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",01419331,,MIMID,,"English","Microprocessors Microsyst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009460332

With FPGAs increasingly being used in low and medium volume productions, many vendors have improved the capacity and versatility of these devices. The enormous logic capacity inherent in state-of-art FPGAs has made it essential to develop automated computer aided design (CAD) support for logic synthesis using these platforms. Since design entry is the only manual phase in the FPGA CAD-flow, it essentially rules out any scope for technology-dependent optimization, which focusses on achieving optimal mapping of logical functionalities onto the target platforms. Evidently, majority of the work related to the implementation of different arithmetic circuits on FPGAs focuses only on the technology-independent optimizations, where the design process consists of modifying the architecture at the top level without giving any consideration to the mapping of the architecture onto the FPGA device. In this paper, we consider the technology-dependent optimization of the fixed-point bit-parallel multipliers on LUT based FPGAs. Our approach re-structures the initial Boolean network and transforms it into an optimized LUT netlist prior to the design entry phase. The design entry of the optimized netlist is then carried out using instantiation based coding styles. This ensures that the optimizations done prior to the design entry phase remain preserved throughout the synthesis process. We particularly focus on 6-input LUTs that are inherent basic logic elements in state-of-art FPGAs. Theoretical analysis and detailed experimentation using state-of-art Xilinx 7th generation FPGAs reveal a substantial speed-up in performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Boolean network; Fixed-point arithmetic; FPGA; LUT; Technology-dependent optimization","Computer aided design; Computer circuits; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Fixed point arithmetic; Integrated circuit design; Logic design; Logic Synthesis; Mapping; Network architecture; Table lookup; Arithmetic circuit; Basic logic elements; Bit-parallel multipliers; Boolean Networks; Optimal mapping; Synthesis process; Technology independent; Volume production; Computer aided logic design","Khurshid, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NITIndia; email: burhan_07phd12@nitsri.net",,"Springer New York LLC",09295585,,DAESF,,"English","Des Autom Embedded Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014751981

The proposed signature encoding for fingerprint and watermark is multi-variable in nature offering strong robustness, low embedding cost and low design overhead. Results on standard benchmarks indicated that the proposed symmetrical approach satisfies all the major protection features of a watermark and fingerprint such as strong robustness to both seller & buyer, low overhead, low runtime and low embedding cost. Further on comparison with baseline design (no protection), the proposed approach offers symmetrical protection (both buyer and seller) at less than 1% area overhead and less than 1.1% latency overhead.

However, online scheduling of dynamic hard real-time tasks on such systems with efficient resource utilization in terms of both space and time poses an enormously challenging problem. We attempt to solve this problem using a combined offline-online approach. The offline component generates and stores various optional feasible placement solutions for different sub-sets of tasks that may possibly be co-mapped together. Given a set of periodic preemptive real-time tasks that requires to be executed at runtime, the online scheduler first carries out an admission control procedure and then produces a schedule, which is guaranteed to meet all timing constraints provided it is spatially feasible to place designated subsets of these tasks at specified scheduling points within a future time interval. These feasibility checks are done and actual placement solutions are obtained through a low overhead search of the statically precomputed placement solutions. Based on this approach, we have proposed a periodic preemptive real-time scheduling methodology for runtime partially reconfigurable devices. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been verified through simulation based experiments and we observed that the strategy achieves high resource utilization with low task rejection rates over various simulation scenarios. © 2017 ACM.","FPGA; Hard real-time systems; Partial reconfiguration; Proportional-fair scheduling; Task placement","Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); General purpose computers; Online systems; Scheduling; General purpose processors; Hard real-time systems; Partial reconfiguration; Partially reconfigurable devices; Proportional fair scheduling; Real-time embedded systems; Reconfigurable systems; Task placement; Real time systems",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",10844309,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

These multiple processors need to communicate with each other and with memory modules. Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs) provide a communication medium in such multi-processor systems by interconnecting a number of processors and memory modules. Besides, MINs also provide a cost effective substitute to costly crossbars in parallel computers and switching systems in telephone industry. This paper introduces two new fault-tolerant MINs named as Shuffle Exchange Gamma Interconnection Networks (SEGIN-1 and SEGIN-2). SEGIN-1 and SEGIN-2 can be obtained by altering Shuffle Exchange Network with one extra stage (SEN+) and provide two disjoint paths similar to it. Performance of SEGIN-1 and SEGIN-2 has been evaluated in terms of alternative paths, disjoint paths, reliability and hardware cost, and is compared with some very famous MINs like Shuffle Exchange Network (SEN), Shuffle Exchange Network with one extra stage (SEN+), Shuffle Exchange Network with two extra stage (SEN+2), Extra Stage Cube (ESC) and Gamma Interconnection Network (GIN).

These applications generally exhibit similar patterns in their specification such as filters in which multiply and accumulate operations are repetitive. If such patterns are identified and used for the system design, trade-off between the area and delay can be achieved. This paper proposes a new methodology which allows to implements a design by retrieving similar patterns known as graph isomorphs and interfaces them as HW accelerators in the system-on-chip design flow. An effective algorithm that converges in polynomial time has been proposed to find such similar subgraphs. In the next phase of the design flow, an algorithm has been proposed which performs the scheduling of clusters and minimizes the time overhead. All algorithms have been written in python for parsing the data flow description and test the correctness of the proposed work. The proposed design flow has been applied to five different programs which are sine, cosine, exponent, matrix multiplication and discrete cosine transform (DCT). These have been described as a data flow graph and have been used for results comparison. An estimation table showing the HW and SW parameter of the data flow operators has been developed for timing and area analysis of the programs. The work is an effort to show the clustering and scheduling of a standalone specification which is mapped on static reconfigurable fabric. Reconfigurable computing systems (RCS) are a popular platform for embedded computing applications as they offer a wide exploration in the design space by allowing HW, SW or HW–SW (hybrid) implementation depending on computational demand and resource requirement. These systems have inspired the designers to find new frameworks for achieving the optimized system characteristics under the given constraints. Any static or dynamic HW hardware optimization in an application can be proposed, implemented and easily verified on the chip. The results presented show the comparison of the proposed approach with SW and HW implementation of DCT design on the Xilinx ML507 board. HW timer has been used to find the execution of each implementation. The experimental verification of the proposed algorithms shows that static IP core design flow gives better results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Field programmable gate arrays; Graph isomorphism; Reconfigurable computing systems; Scheduling","Clustering algorithms; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Discrete cosine transforms; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Integrated circuit design; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Reconfigurable architectures; Scheduling; Set theory; Specifications; System-on-chip; Clustering; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Experimental verification; Graph isomorphism; Hardware optimization; Multiply and accumulate operations; Reconfigurable computing systems; Reconfigurable fabrics; Data flow graphs","Mishra, A.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, BITS-PilaniIndia; email: ashishmishra@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01419331,,MIMID,,"English","Microprocessors Microsyst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008500340

At the same time, SBUs and MBUs in the CM can permanently or temporarily affect the hardware circuit implemented on FPGA. Hence, error mitigation and recovery techniques are necessary to protect the FPGA hardware from permanent faults arising due to such SBUs and MBUs. Different existing techniques used to mitigate the effect of soft errors in FPGA have high overhead and their implementations are also quite complex. In this paper, we have proposed efficient single bit as well as multi-bit error correcting methods to correct errors in the CM of FPGAs using simple parity equations and Erasure code. These codes are easy to implement, and the needed decoding circuits are also simple. Use of Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) along with a simple hardware scheduling algorithm based download manager helps to perform the error correction in the CM without suspending the operations of the other hardware blocks. We propose a first of its kind methodology for novel transient fault correction using efficient error correcting codes with hardware scheduling for FPGAs. To validate the design we have tested the proposed methodology with Kintex FPGA. We have also measured different parameters like fault recovery time, power consumption, resource overhead and error correction efficiency to estimate the performance of our proposed methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","DPR; Erasure code; FPGA; Hardware scheduling; MBU","Codes (symbols); Energy efficiency; Error correction; Errors; Fault tolerant computer systems; Forward error correction; Hardware; Radiation hardening; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Configuration memory; Decoding circuits; Dynamic partial reconfiguration; Erasure codes; Error correcting code; Fault recovery time; Recovery techniques; Soft error mitigations; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Mandal, S.; Variable Energy Cyclotron Center, HBNI,1/AF Bidhannagar, India; email: swaga89@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01419331,,MIMID,,"English","Microprocessors Microsyst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009204976

The current standing spectrum allocation policy is unable to put up the demands of wireless communication. This leads to self-motivated spectrum allocation policy. Cognitive radio (CR) technology is a radiant way to increase spectrum utilization by identifying unused and under-utilized spectrum in vigorously changing environments. Spectrum sensing is a one of the input technique of cognitive radio which detects the existence of primary user in licensed frequency band using self-motivated spectrum allocation policies to use unoccupied spectrum. Spectrum sensing is generally based on energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection. Energy detection is a basic spectrum sensing technique but becomes bleak at a low signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The fundamental cyclostationary feature detection based on cyclic spectrum estimation can actively detect feeble signals from primary users with a cost of maximum complexity on implementation. The objective of this work is to implement precious spectrum-sensing method in field programmable gate array with pragmatic complexity for CR. Particularly, The proposed new spectrum-sensing method called the adaptive absolute-self-coherent-restoral algorithm has been introduced. The complexity of the consequential algorithm is better than the prior self-coherent-restoral (SCORE) algorithm, such as adaptive least-SCORE (ALS), adaptive cross-SCORE (ACS).

Eight different switching states were achieved through these three P–I–N diode combinations.

There are many parameters either intrinsic or extrinsic effects the system. In the memory design some features should be focus like stability, leakage current and delay. These parameters play important role in terms of performance. There is a lot of degradation in performance while not using the system. In this paper we used MTCMOS tech for optimizing parameters like stability static power dissipation and delay. We characterized the parameters of conventional 6T, Asym8T Asym 9T. The main focus is on the Asym 9T because it had low static power dissipation low delay and high stability. We simulated Asym 9T on different values of the threshold values and β values.

In the reported paper, proper analysis on resonant mode excited in the patch that gives circularly polarization is not explained. An extensive analysis explaining the effects of unequal length slots that gives circularly polarized response is presented in the present paper. The rectangular slots realizes tuning of higher order TM02 mode with respect to fundamental TM10 mode. Further, unequal lengths of two slots and feed point location optimizes the surface current contributions in orthogonal directions inside the patch which yields circularly polarized response.

As microstrip patch antenna is a high Q structure, thereby narrow bandwidth, resistive loading (introducing lossy lumped element inside the antenna structure) is considered as potential technique for improving bandwidth. Instead of conventional resistive loading i.e placing resistance of desired value across the substrate an alternative technique of resistive loading is proposed. Here resistances are connected across the slots of microstrip patch antenna. This method of resistive loading is easy and controllable. Resistive loading is performed on a dual slot rectangular microstrip patch antenna. Behavior of the loaded structure for different resistance values and different slot positions has been studied. A significant improvement in the bandwidth of slotted microstrip patch antenna has been achieved at the expense of gain.

The proposed FPGA solution eliminates the need to transfer and persist the entire raw data by processing low-level signals and forming highlevel images in real-time. Objects of interest are detected and segmented from the image stream and a classifier subsequently performs high-level analysis on the segmented images. When compared with existing software-based post-processing workflow, this FPGA-based approach will improve both the number of objects captured per experiment and the overall end-to-end object classification performance.

Post-silicon validation targets the discovery of these errors in early hardware prototypes. Due to limited visibility and observability, dedicated design-for-debug (DFD) hardware such as trace buffers are inserted to aid post-silicon validation. In spite of its benefit, such hardware incurs area overheads, which impose size limitations. However, the overhead could be overcome if the area dedicated to DFD could be reused in-field. In this work, we present a novel method for reusing an existing trace buffer as a victim cache of a processor to enhance performance. The trace buffer storage space is reused for the victim cache, with a small additional controller logic. Experimental results on several benchmarks and trace buffer sizes show that the proposed approach can enhance the average performance by up to 8.3% over a baseline architecture. We also propose a strategy for dynamic power management of the structure, to enable saving energy with negligible impact on performance. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Benchmarking; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; System-on-chip; Base-line architecture; Cache performance; Design verification; Dynamic power management; Functional errors; Hardware prototype; Limited visibility; Post-silicon validations; Buffer storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9783981537093,,,"English","Proc.

Unlike SRAM soft error, which can be effectively protected by ECC, Flip-Flop soft error protection can be costly. We observe that flip-flops/latches can have asymmetric soft error rates when storing different logic values. This asymmetry can be used in conjunction with the different signal probabilities of registers in a design. In this work, we first demonstrate that flip-flop cells can be designed to have different soft error rates when storing different logic values. We also propose a methodology to match registers in a design with the flip-flop cells that minimize the soft error rates. Experimental results on commercial processor show that, with only flip-flop layout changes, our proposed scheme can reduce system SER by 16% with no in overhead performance, power and area. The system SER reduction can be improved to 48% with schematic changes and 6.7% average increase in flip-flop area. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computation theory; Computer circuits; Errors; Integrated circuit design; Radiation hardening; Static random access storage; Data dependence; Logic values; Overhead systems; Resilient computing; Signal probability; Soft error mitigations; Soft error protection; Soft error rate; Flip flop circuits",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9783981537093,,,"English","Proc.

Signal compression is the technique, used to reduce the amount of data that must be transmitted in the signal communication. Algorithms that produce better compression ratio and less loss of data in the reconstructed signal are needed for signal compression. This paper presents the wavelet based signal compression algorithm for ECG signal MIT-BIH arrhythmia database record 117, LELECCUM signal and TIMIT audio signal using adaptive coder. The architecture for mean removal, haar wavelet transform, adaptive encoder, inverse haar wavelet transform and mean insertion are present in this paper. The mean removal is used, since the mean removed signal requires less number of binary bits for their representation. The haar wavelet transform is used to decompose the signal. The proposed adaptive encoder is used to minimize the number of bits transmitted. Experimental results prove that the proposed coder outperforms than other coders such as novel algorithm, Djohn, EZW, SPIHT in terms of simplicity and coding efficiency. For the proposed coder, a compression ratio of 9.344:1 is obtained for MIT-BIH arrhythmia database record 117 with a percent mean square difference as 1.2735.

Advancement of deep submicron technology has made it possible to scale the transistor feature size to the nanometer range, which has enabled multiple processing elements to be integrated onto a single chip. On the flipside, it has made the integrated entities on the chip more susceptible to different faults. Although a significant amount of work has been done in the domain of fault-tolerant mapping and scheduling, existing algorithms either precompute reconfigured mapping solutions at design time while anticipating fault(s) scenarios or adopt a hybrid approach wherein a part of the fault mitigation strategy relies on the design-time solution. The complexity of the problem rises further for real-time dynamic systems where new applications can arrive in the multicore platform at any time instant. For real-time systems, the validity of computation depends both on the correctness of results and on temporal constraint satisfaction. This article presents an improved fault-tolerant dynamic solution to the integrated problem of application mapping and scheduling for NoC-based multicore platforms. The developed algorithm provides a unified mapping and scheduling method for real-time systems focusing on meeting application deadlines and minimizing communication energy. A predictive model has been used to determine the failure-prone cores in the system for which a fault-tolerant resource allocation with task redundancy has been performed. By selectively using a task replication policy, the reliability of the application, executing on a given NoC platform, is improved. A detailed evaluation of the performance of the proposed algorithm has been conducted for both real and synthetic applications. When compared with other fault-tolerant algorithms reported in the literature, performance of the proposed algorithm shows an average reduction of 56.95% in task re-execution time overhead and an average improvement of 31% in communication energy. Further, for time-constrained tasks, deadline satisfaction has also been achieved for most of the test cases by the developed algorithm, whereas the techniques reported in the literature failed to meet deadline in about 45% test cases. © 2017 ACM.","Communication energy; Deadline; Dynamic mapping and scheduling; Fault tolerance; Network-on-chip; Task replication","Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Interactive computer systems; Mapping; Network-on-chip; Real time systems; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Servers; Communication energy; Deadline; Deep sub-micron technology; Dynamic mapping; Fault tolerant algorithms; Synthetic application; Task allocation and scheduling; Task replications; Integrated circuit design","Chatterjee, N.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: navonil@iitkgp.ac.in",,"Association for Computing Machinery",15399087,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

So Domino Logic is one of the power saving technique which helps to avoid this short circuit current and saves power consumption. So in this paper we have made a comparative analysis between the Domino logic and the CMOS logic for which we have used comparator as our reference circuit. As Domino Logic is well known for its power saving technique so the main parameter which we have considered in this paper is power. We also tried to fetch power consumption at different voltage level (voltage scaling) and at least 55% of power is saved by Domino Logic as compared to that of CMOS circuits.

Extracting Features of EEG signal in real time is the most challenging task because of its high variability and complexity. In this paper we have used FPGA (Virtex-5) for extracting the features in real time for Brain Computer Interface applications. Nowadays, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) plays a major crucial role in helping the persons those who are partly or wholly incapable of movement. BCI system which depends on neural signals generated by the brain and these neural signals are recorded using Non Invasive or Invasive techniques. In non invasive technique like EEG (electroencephalography) recordings are taken from the scalp and it is used for analyzing the brain's activity. When compared to Invasive one, non-invasive techniques give a lesser accuracy and less harm to humans. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system, appropriate classification and feature extraction methods are chosen. Existing BCI feature extraction techniques, extracts many features such as band energies,power spectral density etc., but achieving a good classification accuracy is a great challenge. In our paper, this problem is addressed by extracting only P300 event and a good classification accuracy is obtained. EEG signals are stored in internal Block RAM to reduce the design time and complexity. This Block RAM is easy to design and improves the processing speed. The features are extracted from EEG signal using Hanning filter and FIR filter. The performance of FIR and Hanning filter is compared in terms of classification accuracy, using Fisher Linear Discriminator. The area, power and delay are compared by implementing the proposed approach in Virtex-5. However, FIR filter occupies more area, it has very high classification accuracy. Since accuracy plays a major role in BCI applications such as P300 speller,Wheel chair control through EEG, Drivewaves, NeuroBrush, FIR is chosen as Feature extraction technique. © 2016 IEEE.","Accuracy; Efficiency; FIR filter; FPG; Hanning filter","Brain; Brain computer interface; Efficiency; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); FIR filters; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuits; Interfaces (computer); Power spectral density; Signal processing; Spectral density; Accuracy; Brain-computer interface applications; Classification accuracy; Feature extraction methods; Feature extraction techniques; Fisher linear discriminator; Hanning filter; Noninvasive technique; Biomedical signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

It is then compared with a conventional memory architecture on grounds of power, area, leakage and speed of operation for varied memory capacities. DFR-W depicts a reduction of up to 35.58% in latching delay and of about 14% in writing time as compared to the conventional memory architecture. For the new design, there is a drastic decline in leakage current when the device is in hold mode. In DFR-W driver, leakage reduces to about 8.0844nA as compared to 22.833nA in the conventional design.

The design process including the physical design for an application specific SoC has become more complex due to large number of distinct functional modules. Existing physical design flow usually needs many iterations for successful design closure. In this paper, we propose a uniform wire distribution driven early global routing framework. The goal is to assist in obtaining an optimal routing solution for a given SoC floorplan such that the subsequent stages have fewer iterations. Based on the proposed congestion penalty, hierarchical routing order of the nets and a suitable routing region definition for a given floorplan, our method finds a solution with 100% routing completion, total wirelength within a constant bound of HPWL and no overflow in congestion for a given number of routing layers. We also estimate the number of vias incurred due to an existing minimal bend routing topology and uniform wire distribution for a set of routing layers. Experiments on IBM HB floorplanning benchmarks yield 45% improvement in average congestion with marginal increase in netlength, via count, and runtime for up to 8 layer HV routing. Congestion statistics for the critical routing layers such as M1 and M2 also show improvement. © 2016 IEEE.","early global route planning; floorplan; global routing; SoC; uniform wire distribution","Cellular telephone systems; Distributed computer systems; Programmable logic controllers; Semiconductor device manufacture; System-on-chip; Wire; Application specific; Floorplans; Functional modules; Global routing; Hierarchical routings; Route planning; System on chips (SoC); uniform wire distribution; Integrated circuit design",,"Alioto M.Marshall A.Sridhar R.Zhao D.Bhatia K.","IEEE Computer Society",21641676,9781509013661,,,"English","Int.

But due to several harsh operational environments, different types of faults, in the form of stator winding fault, rotor fault etc. develop in the motor. If these faults, which are mostly minor in nature initially, don't get detected in earlier stages then they may inflict major damage in the motor and consequently may disrupt the plant's production capacity. So far, several studies primarily focusing on signature, model and expert system based techniques have been performed for conditioning monitoring of induction motors. Among all these techniques MCSA (Motor Current Signature Analysis) technique has been identified to be the most effective tool for diagnosis of induction motor faults. Most of the traditional condition and monitoring methods, using MCSA, that have been used till date are offline. Such offline analysis leads to delayed fault detection, resulting in plant production being eventually hampered, thus indirectly increasing the production cost. That is why, modern day industries demand online fault diagnosis methods which would analyze faults in real time and prevent any unforeseen production mishaps. FPGA or DSP where the signal is processed in hardware unit can be used for online analysis.

In the traditional hardware design, the 8-point DCT architecture contains more number of logical slices in it. Also, it consists of number of multipliers to update the weight. This leads to huge area consumption and power dissipation in that architecture. To mitigate the conventional drawbacks, this paper presents a novel Hierarchical-based Expression (HBE)-Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM)-based multiplier architecture design for the 8-point DCT structure used in the video CODEC applications. The proposed work involves modified data path architecture and Floating Point Processing Element (FPPE) architecture. Our proposed design of the multipliers and DCT architecture requires minimum number of components when compared to the traditional DCT method. The HBE-MCM-based multiplier architecture includes shifters and adders. The number of Flip-Flops (FFs) and Look Up Tables (LUTs) used in the proposed architecture is reduced. The power consumption is reduced due to the reduction in the size of the components. This design is synthesized in VERILOG code language and implemented in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated by comparing it with traditional DCT architecture in terms of the Number of FFs, Number of LUTs, area, power, delay and speed. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Data path architecture; discrete cosine transform (DCT); field programmable gate array (FPGA); floating point processing element (FPPE); hierarchical-based expression (HBE); multiple constant multiplication (MCM)","Architecture; Computer hardware description languages; Digital arithmetic; Discrete cosine transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Flip flop circuits; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Logic Synthesis; Signal processing; Table lookup; Video signal processing; Data-path architecture; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Floating points; hierarchical-based expression (HBE); Multiple constant multiplications; Computer architecture","Kiruba, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Government College of TechnologyIndia; email: kiruba.m1826@gmail.com",,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Therefore, reduction in the power consumption of the clock networks is a significant objective in high-performance Integrated Circuit (IC) designs. This paper presents a novel Particle Distance Weighted Clustering (PDWC)-Unity Clustering Optimization (UCO) algorithm for the placement of clock buffers in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture. A novel PDWC algorithm is applied for clustering the logical components based on the minimum distance between components. A UCO algorithm is developed to determine the location for the placement of the buffers. This clustering technique reduces the delay rate of the architecture because of the minimum number of logical components. The overall area and power consumption of the FPGA architecture are reduced because of the placement of the buffers and latches.

The effect of the pin dogleg layout of connecting wires has been tested separately for input-output pins and output pins only with controlled use of vias for dogleg during detailed routing. Dogleg may reduce the channel width required for laying down all nets and hence decrease the total chip area. However, invalid selection of dogleg may increase the channel width or may identify a routable circuit as unroutable. Unwanted dogleg may also increase the use of vias (switches) required for changing the track from one to another and may create a congested area with vias. Congested via may introduce lithographic printing problem during manufacturing and power leakage problem. The proposed technique considers all these constraints to provide an optimal result and gives a compact layout for a circuit with controlled via for doglegging. The results obtained show that pin dogleg layout produces a more compact layout for connecting wires with supervised via when compared to dogleg-free routing or doglegged routing with unsupervised via for some standard benchmark circuits.

These components are processed in the discrete phase-locked loop to estimate instantaneous frequency variation and instantaneous amplitude variation. The estimated instantaneous frequency variation is fed back to SOGI to adjust the center frequency. Proposed mono-component AM–FM demodulator is implemented in FPGA platform.

Recording from dozens to hundreds of electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an unparalleled rate.

Supported with the analysis, proposed considerations are the experimental outcomes of measurements and characterization of fabricated ICs, which are not directly available in any of the previously published works. A phenomenon of IF shift with respect to received RF power level is explained for a practical RX system by presenting a detailed model for the parasitics of packaged integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit board (PCB). A general equation for the lower bound of IF (f-IFmin) is derived for a given maximum input RF power (P-inmax) in the presence of parasitic capacitances, which ensures a fixed IF. Measurement results of a low IF RX (Design1) show that f-IFmin is 1.96 MHz for Pinmax of-35 dBm and total parasitic capacitances of 1.7 pF, which matches with the proposed analytical model. A low IF RX (Design2) was also fabricated in 180 nm mixed mode CMOS technology by using the proposed considerations. The measurement results of Design2 show that problem of IF shift was completely removed and the IF remains fixed at 1.2 MHz even when the Pinmax is much more than-35 dBm. © 2016 IEEE.","Injection pulling; LNA-LO co-design; low IF receivers; MedRadio; minimum IF","Biomedical equipment; Capacitance; Design; Embedded systems; Integrated circuit design; Medical applications; Printed circuit boards; Radio receivers; Signal receivers; VLSI circuits; Co-designs; Injection pulling; Low-IF receivers; Medradio; minimum IF; Low noise amplifiers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

A significant strategy adopted in tackling such a problem is to procure different components or IPs (intellectual properties) of the SoC from different third party IP vendors (3PIPs). Such a technique targets independent working of the SoC components and removes the threat of the occurrence of malicious circuitry or Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) having a distributed architecture. However, trustworthiness of the 3PIP vendors is a concern and possibility exists in the implantation of a HTH in the individual IPs procured from them. In this work, we analyze the effects of such Trojans, which may induce sudden unintentional delays at runtime, affecting the basic security principles of the SoC. We propose a self aware approach which works on the observe-decide-act (ODA) paradigm to counteract the scenario. Existing literature on hardware security generally focus on detection of anomaly, but is silent on organizing low level security mechanisms in such a manner that the high level objective of secure task completion is facilitated at run time. Our proposed methodology not only overcomes this limitation but also ensures security without tampering the IP designs. Experimental analysis is performed using AES crypto SoC architecture. Low overhead in area and power of the security elements as obtained in experimentation supports its applicability for practical SoC applications. © 2016 IEEE.","Hardware Trojans Horses (HTH); Runtime Security; Self Awareness","Embedded systems; Hardware; Hardware security; Internet protocols; Malware; Network security; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; VLSI circuits; Distributed architecture; Experimental analysis; Runtimes; Security elements; Security mechanism; Security principles; Self awareness; System on chips (SoC); Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

Because differential SA is vulnerable to the bias current offset in the differential legs. Thus, SRAM suffer from slow read speed or low read yield. This paper for the first time presents a novel differential-current-compensation based SA (DCC-SA) to suppress the effect of offset due to device mismatch on SA differential current. The proposed scheme is rigorously analyzed and compared to the conventional schemes. The proposed technique, enable DCC-SA to achieve 0.66× and 0.86× tighter offset distribution than conventional current latch SA (CLSA) and SA with offset compensation (SAOC) respectively, under similar cell current and bitline capacitance. We design a CMOS-logic-compatible, 65 nm, 4 Kb SRAM macro, using the DCC-SA. This technique possesses up to 31%, 55%, 35% and 69% lower energy/access and 0.58×,-1.27×, 0.53× and 0.41× lower resolution time (RT), compared to CLSA, SAOC, Schmitt Trigger (ST) based SA (STn-SA), and stacked SA (STk-SA) respectively at worst case process corners. Further, the standard deviation (σ) of delay for DCC-SA is reduced to 0.3× and 0.56×, 0.3× and 0.54× as that of CLSA, SAOC, STn-SA and STk-SA respectively. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Latch Sense Amplifier; inter die variations; intra die variations; Offset; SRAM","Capacitance; Dynamic random access storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit design; Static random access storage; VLSI circuits; Conventional currents; Conventional schemes; Differential current; inter die variations; intra die variations; Latch sense amplifiers; Offset; Offset compensation; Amplifiers (electronic)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

The employment of Matrix Quantizer (MQ) in EBCOT reduces the computational burden by generating the context decision pair from probabilistic estimation.

The bit truncation in MQ-coder reduces the computational complexities that lead to a reduction in the memory space occupation in the hardware platform. This paper proposes the Auxiliary Minutest MQ (AMMQ) architecture for bit truncation in the probability estimation of context decision pair making. The reduction in a number of bits minimizes the slice registers and lookup tables utilization that offers less flip-flop consumption to achieve the compact chip development for JPEG2000 compression. Besides, the reduction in computational steps effectively minimizes the time delay and hence the high operating frequency.

The optimization technique incorporates Levy flight principle to improve convergence. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to construct initial solutions for simulated annealing (SA) scheme and these initial solutions are used to decompose the entire search space into different annealing regions. Further, each annealing region is exploited to search for optimum solution using simulated annealing scheme while maintaining high degree of diversity.

This paper proposes a high throughput Fixed Point Discrete Kalman filter (DKF) architecture for denoising images with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at real-time. A linearized state model based on neighbor pixel similarity is used for improving the PSNR of the noisy image. A 5-stage two parallel bi-functional trapezoidal systolic array architecture based on modified Faddeev algorithm (MFA) is chosen as basic functional block of DKF. Two parallel sets of MFA unit are utilized to increase the throughput by 1.6×, reduce the latency by 1.8× while trading off an increased utilization. In addition, the boundary cell of MFA is modified by replacing the divider unit with a highly pipelined two stage Lookup table based Newton Raphson divider. The architecture implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA can denoise 512 × 512 images in real-time (≈ 33 fps) achieving highest throughput among the state of art architectures. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of denoising on synthetic and real world images shows the applicability of the proposed architecture. © 2016 IEEE.","Denoising; Kalman Filter; Parallel Processing; Pipelining; Realtime","Bandpass filters; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gaussian noise (electronic); Kalman filters; Pipe linings; Systolic arrays; Table lookup; Throughput; VLSI circuits; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; De-noising; Discrete Kalman filters; Parallel processing; Proposed architectures; Qualitative evaluations; Real time; Systolic array architecture; Image denoising",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

In this design, we have taken two main parameters for analysis that is frequency (1600 MHz) and Voltage (1.05V). DDR4L operates at the lowest Voltage compared to available RAM's. Environment (LFM, Heat Sink, and Capacitance) is kept constant. For the simulation of the logic, Xilinx is used with Verilog as hardware description language.

However, such systems are impractical in many cases, particularly due to the complex rerouting process involved once the system turns faulty. The efficiency is reduced as the scale in circuit size increases in Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) techniques. One of the reasons is the extra hardware. The Embryonic concept has within itself a theory called Endocrine cellular communication system which is the idea behind the proposed fault tolerance system. Here, the endocrine theory is being imbibed with in the digital circuit to achieve the best possible fault tolerance. The proposed method is, in the digital circuit each working unit is surrounded by two spare units and if any one of the working unit becomes faulty, the spare unit should automatically turn active. The priority set by the system helps in choosing the spare unit to be used. The ultimate goal of this work is to overcome challenges and implement a platform model for fault tolerance techniques in digital Systems. This platform model would be used in very large-scale integrated circuits capable of self-healing and Self-replication. © 2016 IEEE.","Dual modular redundancy; embryonic; endocrine; fault tolerance; rerouting; self-healing; self-replication; spare unit; triple modular redundancy","Computation theory; Digital circuits; Fault tolerant computer systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Mobile telecommunication systems; Redundancy; Dual modular redundancy; embryonic; endocrine; rerouting; Self-healing; Self-replications; spare unit; Triple modular redundancy; Fault tolerance",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

In a simple hearing aid gain is applied to the whole input frequency range, due to which the intensities of some speech sounds after amplification will be larger than the discomfort thresholds. To solve this problem a highly reconfigurable non-uniform digital FIR filter bank structure is proposed, where the whole frequency range is divided into several subbands and each subband has its own amplification coefficient. The non-uniform spaced subbands can be realized with Variable Bandwidth Filters (VBF). Each VBF can be realized as a combination of arbitrary sample rate converters and FIR filter. The Distributed Arithmetic (DA) based FIR filter is a wise choice where all the multiplications and additions are replaced by a lookup table and shifter-accumulator. The proposed architecture uses a multiplier less structure, where the sample rate converters are realized using Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC) filters and the FIR filter uses Distributed Arithmetic. The use of multiplier less structures leads to significant decrease in area and power consumption.

Transient errors are random faults of the hardware, which also called as soft errors. Single Event Transients (SETs) are major part of the error events which will continue to grow in the next technology nodes and affect the system functionality. Varieties of electronic products are coming into market and most of them are incorporated with large memory components, which will lead to an increase in error rates. This paper presents a very fast and accurate technique to estimate the soft error rate of digital circuits in the occurrence of Single Event Transients (SETs). Analytical approach is implemented in the proposed method to estimate the total failure rate probability along different paths in a design which includes node error rate and error propagation error rate. Paper computed the probability that a hit at any gate has an impact in the desired function of the model and is implemented using path construction, topological sorting and propagation rules. Experiment on a circuit and comparison of the results with cube based error propagation probability(EPP) analysis showed that the proposed method shows more accurate evaluation in error rate estimation of a designed model.

For establishing effective communication among the SoCs, traditional bus architecture has been used. But this becomes insufficient when the data traffic has increased. Network on Chip (NoC) is a solution for this issue. In NoC, the traditional bus structure is replaced with a network which consists of routers, links and IPs. Data packets are transmitted over this network. A modified NoC router architecture is proposed in this work, in which the virtues of Decimal Matrix Code (DMC) are utilized. In the earlier works, Hamming code served the purpose of error detection, but it was limited to a single bit. With the integration of DMC, errors up to five bits can be detected and corrected at the same. This architecture is applicable for two dimensional NoCs like Dynamic Network on Chip (DyNoC). The loopback module, which is a distinct feature of DyNoc, helps to dynamically re-route the data packets, if the neighbouring routers become unavailable all of a sudden. The routing operation is governed by the XY routing algorithm. The analysis of the proposed router architecture in terms of the error detection and correction capability is carried out in this work.

Dense design creates a wide variety of faults leading to the failures in the memory functions. Built-in self-test (BIST) mechanism is a promising method to test and diagnose embedded memories like RAMs. The advantages include reduced test cycle duration and fewer complexes. March tests are widely used in production test thanks to their low time complexity and high fault coverage. They were capable of locating and identifying the fault types. Diagnostic data exportation by the BIST is time - consuming since it is exported bit-by-bit. To overcome this, a BIST with March-element-based (MEB) Compression scheme is proposed. MEB Compression scheme can efficiently compress the diagnostic data of a RAM tested by a March test. To optimize the performance of the BIST controller, another design is also proposed here. Detection of different faults in a RAM memory using a single counter based BIST design is advantageous. As a result a fusion of March algorithms like MATS, March C and March X are used for the detection of Stuck-at fault, Coupling fault and Transition fault respectively. Advantages of counter-based BIST architecture includes reduced area overhead and complexity. Compression of the test data is carried out using a decoder module. The implementations are carried out by using Verilog Hardware description language and Xilinx ISE 13.2 design suite. Experimental results shows that the proposed methods reduces the fault detection time, redundant diagnostic data, tester storage requirement, area overhead and complexity in the design. © 2016 IEEE.","Built-in self-test; Coupling fault; March algorithms; March X; MarchC; MATS; Stuck-at fault; Transition fault","Built-in self test; Computer hardware description languages; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit testing; Memory architecture; Random access storage; System-on-chip; Coupling faults; March algorithm; March X; MarchC; MATS; Stuck-at faults; Transition faults; Fault detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

Accurate measurement of electric parameters is required to determine the quality of power which involves collecting, analyzing and processing of voltage and current samples over a period of time. So addressing to this a power meter is required that measures electric parameters with high accuracy and computation speed for different loads. Existing Electromechanical power meters are of low cost but still are being replaced by electronic power meters because of their better accuracy and dynamic range. This paper presents power meter to measure electric parameters like real power, reactive power, and power factor of different loads where data processing is FPGA based.

Employing Non-invasive procedures for measurement of fECG not only ensures minimal patient discomfort, but also makes the product suitable for wearable applications. However, non-invasive fECG extraction has proven to be difficult due to low amplitudes of fECG signals, attenuation by maternal biological tissues, overlapping spectra with other fetal and maternal bio-signals and low-frequency noise in measurement devices. This paper describes the design of a noise optimized Analog-Front-End (AFE) for a non-invasive fECG monitor. The design criterion laid down for the fECG monitor require it to be an ambulatory, low-power, inexpensive device, interfaced to a smart-phone and capable of running computationally intensive signal processing algorithms. The primary role of the AFE is to filter-out large DC offsets, movement artifacts, high-frequency noise and subsequently amplify and condition the extracted signals before digitization. This noise optimized design makes use of active-electrodes fabricated on small printed circuit boards (PCB). Each PCB is mounted on standard Ag-AgCl electrodes to buffer, filter and amplify abdominal bio-signals as soon as they are detected. The extracted signals are then sent to the fECG monitor PCB for further processing and signal conditioning, before being digitized by a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of an ARM Cortex M3 based system-on-chip (SoC). The monitor is designed to work with supply voltages from 3.6Vdc to 5.5Vdc, allowing it to be powered from a variety of sources; battery packs to USB connectors. Working of the AFE was tested using synthetic signals and elementary biological signals. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Analog to digital conversion; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Electrodes; Integrated circuit design; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit design; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; Smartphones; System-on-chip; Analog to digital converters; Assessment technique; Fetal electrocardiographies; High-frequency noise; Printed circuit boards (PCB); Signal processing algorithms; System on chips (SoC); Wearable applications; Biomedical signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509051632,,,"English","IEEE Stud.

Though issues of cost and stringent marketing deadlines have been resolved in such a methodology, yet the root of hardware trust has been evicted. Malicious circuitry, a.k.a. Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH), is inserted by adversaries in the less trusted phases of design. A HTH remains dormant during testing but gets triggered at runtime to cause sudden active and passive attacks. In this work, we focus on the runtime passive threats based on the parameter delay. Nature-inspired algorithms offer an alternative to the conventional techniques for solving complex problems in the domain of computer science. However, most are optimization techniques and none is dedicated to security. We seek refuge to the crypsis behavior exhibited by geckos in nature to generate a runtime security technique for SoC architectures, which can bypass runtime passive threats of a HTH. An adaptive security intellectual property (IP) that works on the proposed security principles is designed. Embedded timing analysis is used for experimental validation. Low area and power overhead of our proposed security IP over standard benchmarks and practical crypto SoC architectures as obtained in experimental results supports its applicability for practical implementations. © 2017 ACM.","Crypsis; Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH); SoC security","Computer hardware; Hardware; Hardware security; Internet protocols; Malware; System-on-chip; Adaptive security; Conventional techniques; Crypsis; Experimental validations; Nature inspired algorithms; Optimization techniques; Security principles; Semiconductor design; Integrated circuit design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15504832,,,,"English","ACM J.

Two techniques of power gating are introduced in this work, PG1 and PG2. PG1 results in more power savings than PG2, however, PG2 has an advantage of low area overhead. Simulation has been carried out for all possible input combinations of LUT, designed in Cadence Virtuoso tool at 45nm technology.

RS code is a promising code for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) which is ideally suitable for wireless application. Design of compact, high-speed and low-power RS(23, 17) code is challenging for today’s wireless communication systems. Here, an optimization algorithm is introduced which is very simple and it is employed to reduce the number of XOR gates required to design constant Galois Field (GF) multipliers. In this paper, a compact RS(23, 17) encoder and decoder circuit is designed and implemented for Ultra Wide Band(UWB) application. The number of two input XOR gates is reduced by 29.27 (20.00) and 56.10 (66.15) % respectively for local and global optimization compared to unoptimized RS encoder (syndrome block) without increasing its delay. The proposed algorithm is also employed to design the RS(204, 188) and RS(255, 223) encoder. All designs are simulated and synthesized for Vertex4 FPGA platform. Proposed algorithm is also used for the design of Chien Search and Forney blocks. Implemented RS(23, 17) codec requires lesser number of slices and LUTs over the unoptimized RS codec.

Sometimes RW demands real-time implementation that can be made by hardware realization and RCM-based RW becomes appealing due to its integer transform nature followed by least significant bit (LSB) substitution for embedding. This motivates us to propose RCM-RW on digital images with two objectives: modification on the existing RCM algorithm to increase embedding rate with low visual distortion.

In wire linked communication systems, when data flows without any accompanying clock over a single wire, the receiver of the system is required to recover this data synchronously without losing the information. Therefore there exists a need for CDR circuits in the receiver of the system for recovering the clock or timing information from these data. The existing Octa-rate CDR circuit is not compatible to real time data, such a data is unpredictable, non periodic and has different arrival times and phase widths. Thus the proposed PRN based Octa-rate Clock and Data Recovery circuit is made compatible to real time data by introducing a Random Sequence Generator. The proposed PRN based Octa-rate Clock and Data Recovery circuit consists of PRN Sequence Generator, 16-Phase Generator, Early Late Phase Detector and Delay Line Controller. The FSM based Delay Line Controller controls the delay length and introduces the required delay in the input data. The PRN based Octa-rate CDR circuit has been realized using Xilinx ISE 13.2 and implemented on Vertex-5 FPGA target device for real time verification.

Bayesian belief networks are suitable for target recognition within a network using the category, identity and type or class of a target. These three attributes are being modelled based on the theory, which relies on previous and related trials approach. It is a classical problem which uses the observers' belief that an event will occur or not. Similarly, it can predict from previous trial reports whether a node is reliable or not. An RFID network faced with the reader collision problem when multiple readers are deployed densely and enters the region of another reader. Tags receive signal from more than one reader and instant identification by a single reader becomes a problem. The aim of this paper is to develop an efficient anti-collision algorithm, where using BBN, the reader identifies foreign elements like unwanted tags and readers and detect the specific/authentic tags. Similarly, the tag can respond the specific reader only and rejecting signal from unwanted readers, thus control the transmitting characteristics and minimizes the collision problems.

An LFSR requires D flip flops and exclusive OR (XOR) gates for its realization. Four different LFSR architectures based on different types of circuits for D flip flop and XOR gate are put forward. The first architecture uses true-single phase clock (TSPC) D flip-flop and static CMOS XOR gate, the second employs TSPC based D flip-flop and Transmission Gate based XOR gate. The other two architectures use transmission gate based D flip flop and differ in the use XOR gate (static CMOS or transmission gate). The functionality of the proposed architectures is verified through SPICE simulations using 0.18 μm TSMC CMOS technology parameters. The performance of the proposed architectures is compared on the basis of highest frequency and power consumption. It is found that the LFSR employing TSPC based D flip flop are capable of achieving highest operating frequency and satisfy the low-power concern of the VLSI chips. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital; LFSR; Low Power; Subthreshold","Bit error rate; CMOS integrated circuits; Feedback; Flip flop circuits; Integrated circuit design; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Digital; LFSR; Linear feedback shift registers; Low Power; Operating frequency; Proposed architectures; Subthreshold; Transmission gate; Shift registers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique promises to deliver high data rate with simple receiver structure. It is more spectral efficient and has been recommended to be used by many standards. But it has one major disadvantage of having high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). High PAPR drives the power amplifier in saturation region and causes it to operate in nonlinear region with reduced efficiency. There are several techniques to reduce PAPR of OFDM system. In this paper we have done FPGA implementation of selective mapping method (SLM) for PAPR reduction for 4 QAM baseband signal for 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 number of subcarriers. The result obtained have been compared with PAPR values obtained through mathematical analysis and Matlab simulations and also with original signal. For 1024 number of subcarriers at 10-3 of CCDF value the PAPR value obtained with hardware implementation is 9.8 dB which is 2.8 dB less form the original OFDM signal obtained without applying SLM technique but 0.9 dB higher than the Matlab simulated value. This technique is simple in implementation, utilizes less resources and is effective in PAPR reduction. © 2016 IEEE.","FPGA; OFDM; Peak to Average Power Ratio; Selected Mapping","Digital storage; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency division multiplexing; Hardware; Intelligent control; Mapping; MATLAB; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power amplifiers; Power control; Power electronics; Radio broadcasting; Hardware implementations; Linear power amplifiers; Low-power consumption; Mathematical analysis; Modulation techniques; Peak to average power ratio; Selected mapping; Selective mapping methods; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

With the saturation in the scaling down of transistors to increase speed and performance, it is highly imperative to develop multi-core architectures for increased performance. But the increase in the core count per chip makes it more critical to design an efficient memory sub-system especially for the last level cache (LLC) that is shared among all the cores in a processor. The efficient utilization of the LLC is a dominant method to achieve the best microprocessor throughput. In this paper, the Reference Table (RT) based cache design for LLC of multi-core microprocessor is proposed using LRU replacement policy. The proposed RT Cache design adjusts itself based on the workload and automatically changes the utilization of the cache blocks to cope with the changes in the set access pattern so as to decrease the number of conflict misses. Also, at the same time it takes the advantage of accessing multiple cache blocks simultaneously so as to facilitate fast cache search of the set-associative LLC. The proposed architecture has been tested for a four core x86 multi-core architecture using Multi2sim open source tool. It is observed from the simulations that the proposed design provides an increase of 15.16% in cycles per second and 2.28% increase in hit ratio for L2 cache as compared to the n-way set associative cache. © 2016 IEEE.","conflict miss; last level cache; multi-core; RT cache; set associative cache","Buffer storage; Cache memory; Integrated circuit design; Conflict miss; Last-level caches; Multi core; RT cache; Set associative cache; Computer architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015365201

Paper is more specific for the design of diagonalizing pre-coder in downstream transmission of vectored DSL. Different algorithms for the design of linear and nonlinear pre-coders have been proposed in the past.

In such grid-tied systems, it is necessary to ensure the reliable tripping of grid-interfaced inverters whenever the grid is unintentionally disconnected. As such, anti-islanding protection schemes are crucial for grid-interfaced Distributed Generation (DG) systems which assure the safety of critical loads, devices and personnel. This paper evaluates the implementation of various FPGA based passive anti-islanding protection schemes and their comparative performance. The synchronization of the DG inverter with the grid is ensured with aMoving Average Filter based Phase Locked Loop (MAF-PLL). The filter also aids for providing an input to the Over/Under Frequency and the Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) protection techniques that has been employed for protection against events of islanding in the DG system. The dc-link capacitor voltage is a reflection of the active power exchange at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) and hence any mismatch at the PCC causes the dc-link voltage to fluctuate. An over and under voltage protection scheme at the PCC has also been used. The schemes are tested in simulation as well as hardware co-simulation environment to validate their functioning. © 2016 IEEE.","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA); Photovotaic (PV)","Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Passive filters; Phase locked loops; Anti-islanding protection; Dc-link capacitor voltages; Distributed energy systems; Distributed generation system; Photovotaic (PV); Point of common coupling; Rate of change of frequencies; Under-voltage protections; Distributed power generation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015415804

To develop a novel SRAM design, different transistor circuits are available. Normally SRAM cell uses conventional 4 transistor circuit in low power applications. In this thesis, instead of conventional circuit, 8 transistor (8T) and ten transistor(10T) designs are tried to improve the power efficiency under various temperature conditions. Initially 8T and 10T SRAM circuits are designed with write driver logic and the power is calculated for both static and dynamic conditions. Then, charge recycling logic is tried along with precharge logic with various temperature ranges. From the design, total power, static power, dynamic power, Transient time, transient delay and static current in 8T SRAM and 10T SRAM cell are calculated and compared. The 8T SRAM has the least transistor count and least area efficient, but speed of operation is somewhat reduced. Further, increase in the transistor count in 10T SRAM cell, however, makes area and delay large in room temperature. When temperature increases from a particular value, the 10T SRAM cell performs better than the 8T SRAM cell. This justifies the use of 10T SRAM cell for low power applications with varying temperature conditions.

The circular polarization provides better power reception in whatever the direction body worn antenna turns. For achieving the circular polarization, a rectangular slot of 45° at the center of the circular patch is used. In the ground plane a rectangular cross slot is introduced for improving the bandwidth. The simulation result shows that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 110 MHz and the gain of the antenna is 3.6 dB.

Understanding the behavior of the whole system in the presence of faults affecting digital circuits is crucial for designing and validating fault tolerance techniques. Fault injection is a well-known and widely used approach for estimating the behavior of a system in the presence of errors. Among the different techniques, FPGA-based fault injection is one of the most popular since it allows a low-cost, rapid and accurate approach compared to simulation- and hardware based fault injectors.

The proposed antenna uses a modified dumbbell shaped slot of much larger length placed in a planar SIW cavity to excite three closely spaced SIW cavity hybrid modes which help the slot to radiate into free space. The design is analyzed with the help of equivalent circuit model to predict the resonant frequencies of the design and also to explain the excitation mechanism of the proposed slot antenna. The proposed circuit model is validated by comparing its performance with the simulation model for a wide range of parametric variation. The relationship between modification in design dimension with the variation of coupling between feed line and cavity modes is studied which gives a design guideline for the proposed antenna.

Traditional implementations have been using application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or DSP processors. However, the increase in logic capacity and versatility of the field programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms has made it possible to realize numerically intense algorithms and thus provide a complete system-on-chip (SoC) solution in a single package. With modern FPGAs fast moving from prototype designing to low and medium volume productions, it becomes imperative to consider architectural optimizations that are specific to FPGAs only. In this paper, for the first time, we attempt to optimize filtering structures by considering the technology-dependent approaches. We present a general procedure that can be used to efficiently map the Boolean networks onto FPGA fabric. Based on this procedure, a technology optimal realization of the multiply-adder unit, which is a fundamental functional unit in FIR filters is presented. Since no such implementation has been reported, we have compared our implementations against the various technology-independent optimizations that have been detailed in prior literature. Further, to give an idea about the performance speed-up achieved with our implementations, we have compared our results against the FIR structures based on the multiply-adder IP v 2.0, inherent in Xilinx FPGAs. A distinctive feature of our implementation is that a simultaneous speed-up is achieved in all three parameters (area, speed and power). This is in contrast to the technology-independent implementations where there is always a performance trade-off between different parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","FIR filters; FPGA realizations; Look-up table; Technology mapping; Technology-Dependent optimization; Ternary adder","Adders; Application specific integrated circuits; Bandpass filters; Digital signal processing; Economic and social effects; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Impulse response; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; System-on-chip; Table lookup; Digital signal processing (DSP); Filtering structures; Look up table; Optimal realization; Performance trade-off; Technology independent; Technology mapping; Various technologies; FIR filters","Khurshid, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology SrinagarIndia; email: burhan_07phd12@nitsri.net",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010871644

PSO and GSA are simple, population based robust evolutionary algorithms but have the problem of suboptimality, individually. The proposed GSA–PSO based approach has overcome this disadvantage faced by both the PSO and the GSA algorithms and is employed in this paper for the optimal designs of two amplifier circuits. The transistors’ sizes are optimized using GSA–PSO in order to minimize the areas occupied by the circuits and to improve the design/performance parameters of the circuits. Various design specifications/performance parameters are optimized to optimize the transistor’s sizes and some other design parameters using GSA–PSO. By using the optimal transistor sizes, Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis simulation has been carried out in order to show the performance parameters. The simulation results justify the superiority of GSA–PSO over differential evolution, harmony search, artificial bee colony and PSO in terms of convergence speed, design specifications and performance parameters of the optimal design of the analog CMOS amplifier circuits. It is shown that GSA–PSO based design technique for each amplifier circuit yields the least MOS area, and each designed circuit is shown to have the best performance parameters like gain, power dissipation etc., as compared with those of other recently reported literature. Still the difficulties and challenges faced in this work are proper tuning of control parameters of the algorithms GSA and PSO, some conflicting design/performance parameters and design specifications, which have been partially overcome by repeated manual tuning. Multi-objective optimization may be the proper alternative way to overcome the above difficulties. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Circuit sizing; CMOS; Differential amplifier; Evolutionary optimization techniques; GSA–PSO; Low power design; Two-stage op-amp","Analog circuits; CMOS integrated circuits; Differential amplifiers; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Integrated circuit design; Learning algorithms; Low power electronics; Metals; MOS devices; Multiobjective optimization; Operational amplifiers; Optimal systems; Oxide semiconductors; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Specifications; SPICE; Timing circuits; Transistors; Tuning; Circuit Sizing; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Evolutionary Optimization Techniques; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Low-power design; Meta-heuristic search algorithms; Simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis; Two-stage operational amplifiers; Optimization","Kar, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT DurgapurIndia; email: rajibkarece@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",18688071,,,,"English","Intl.

In this paper, we propose delayed FxLMS (DFxLMS) and delayed FsLMS (DFsLMS) algorithm to address this issue. We have presented the performance of DFxLMS and DFsLMS algorithms through simulation study and found negligible performance degradation over FxLMS and FsLMS algorithms for one-sample delay, but severe performance degradation for two or higher sample delays. Based on these finding, we have chosen DFxLMS and DFsLMS algorithms instead of FxLMS and FsLMS to perform controller output computation and error computation concurrently in two separate pipeline stage. Block formulation of DFxLMX and DFsLMS also presented and parallel structures are derived to further explore efficiency of hardware structures. We have derived folded structures of DFsLMS- and delayed block FsLMS (DBFsLMS)-based single-channel ANC, and DBFsLMS-based dual-channel ANC for low-complexity realization by resource sharing. Theoretical estimate demonstrate that the DBFxLMS and DBFsLMS structures offer nearly L times higher throughput than the DFxLMS and DFsLMS structures and involve proportionately less hardware resource as register complexity of block-based structures is independent of block size (L). Compared with the existing FxLMS-based structure, the DBFxLMS structure involves L times more multipliers and adders, (3 Q+ 2) less registers and offers more than L times higher throughput, where Q is the secondary-path filter length. ASIC synthesis result shows that the DBFxLMS and DBFsLMS structures involve 11 % and 24 % less area-delay product (ADP), and 20 % and 30 % less energy per sample (EPS) than the DFxLMS and DFsLMS structures, respectively. The proposed DFxLMS and DBFxLMS structures involve 55 % and 58 % less ADP, 30 % and 41 % less EPS than those of the existing FxLMS-based structure and offers significantly higher throughput. Since the current design trend with increasing transistor density moves toward higher level of parallelism in implementation to reduce computation time and energy consumption, the proposed design approach would be interesting and useful for low-power implementation of ANC. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ANC; Block processing; FsLMS; FxLMS; VLSI Architecture","Acoustic variables control; Adaptive filtering; Controllers; Energy utilization; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Noise abatement; Passive filters; Throughput; VLSI circuits; Block processing; Electrical interface; Filtered x least mean squares; FsLMS; FxLMS; Low power implementation; Performance degradation; VLSI architectures; Structural design","Mohanty, B.K.; Jaypee University of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: bk.mohanti@juet.ac.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010916196

It is found that there is a slight degradation in the performance of the antenna when the superstrate is touching the antenna i.e height of the superstrate above the EMD (H =0 mm). Further, it is also observed that the degraded performance characteristics of the EMD antenna can be improved by placing the dielectric superstrates above the EMD at optimum height (H) = Hopt. The EMD antenna without dielectric superstrate achieves an impedance bandwidth of 3.354 GHz (SWR&lt; 2) at 3.20 GHz, and loaded with dielectric superstrates which shows that the resonate frequency is decreased and achieved impedance bandwidth is 3.351GHz (SWR&lt; 2) at 3.37 GHz. As the dielectric constant of the superstrate increases, it has been observed that the center frequency 3.39 GHz and gain is decreased to 7.40 dB from 7.52 dB. As the height of the superstrate is increased the performance of the antenna improves and at particular optimum height, the gain and bandwidth for all the superstrates will be closer to the free space radiation conditions of the EMD antenna without superstate. However, the return-loss for all dielectric constants of the superstrates is more than -18.60 dB which is well above the acceptable limit. The variation in return-loss is within acceptable limits. This antenna is stable radiation pattern with low cross polarization, low back radiation, nearly identical E- and H-plane patterns.

Digital filter design involves several multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations, which consume a large amount of hardware resources and computation cost. Distributed Arithmetic (DA) approach is proposed in literature as an alternative and efficient technique for MAC operation based designs. Similarly, reconfigurable computing possesses the benefits of both worlds, i.e., flexibility of software and high performance of hardware using flexible high speed computing fabric such as FPGA for efficient use of hardware resources. In this paper, design of FIR filters using the concepts of distributed arithmetic and reconfigurable computing is proposed. Two reconfigurable architectures are proposed and implemented on an SRAM based Xilinx FPGA board. The performance of proposed design is evaluated with and without reconfiguration architectures and their results are reported.

This paper deals with different techniques used in the low power high throughput MAC design along with PME to achieve low power consumption guaranteeing the targeted performance as per the standard and beyond. The resulting architecture promises to give 24 to 26% less power consumption in Access Point (AP) and Station (STA) configurations. © 2016 IEEE.","Aggregation; AP; Beam forming; Block Acknowledgment; data-rate; DMG; High speed; high throughput; IEEE 802.11ad WLAN; Low Power; MAC; PME; Radio frequency; Scanning; SoC; STA","Access control; Agglomeration; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Low power electronics; Medium access control; Power management; Programmable logic controllers; Scanning; System-on-chip; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Block Acknowledgment; Data rates; High Speed; High throughput; IEEE 802.11ad WLAN; Low Power; Radio frequencies; Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

This algorithm can be applied for any length of data, by processing it in a block of 16 bytes at a time. The last block may have less than 16 bytes. To process an input block of 16 bytes, the algorithm first forms an optimized table of pre-calculated CRC. Corresponding to the input data, lookup from this table is done and the results from the table lookup are combined by XOR operations to form the final CRC of the input data. The Ethernet data whose CRC needs to be calculated is processed in blocks of 128 bits at clock frequency of 312.5 MHz to achieve a throughput of 40Gbps. The entire design is functionally verified using ModelSim SE Plus 6.3g.

The slotted array consists of three transverse slots in the top wall of SIW which are inclined at 45° with respect to a single longitudinal slot. The number of slots and the position of the slotted array determine the impedance bandwidth. It is found from the simulated and measured results that the impedance bandwidth of the antenna is 92% (10 GHz-27 GHz) for S11 ≤ -10 dB. Multiple modes get excited in the SIW-SAA resulting in multidirectional characteristics and an equivalent circuit model is used to explain the physics of this phenomenon. In the X band, the lowest mode (TE10) of SIW exists and the combination of slotted array and SIW is responsible for unidirectional radiation. Bidirectional and omnidirectional patterns are observed in the elevation plane for Ku and K bands, respectively due to higher order modes that are excited in the bottom wall of SIW. With these multidirectional characteristics, the proposed antenna is an attractive choice in airborne control systems, long distance communications and broadcasting. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Antenna arrays; Bandwidth; Directional patterns (antenna); Electric impedance; Equivalent circuits; Flight control systems; Microwave antennas; Omnidirectional antennas; Substrate integrated waveguides; Waveguides; Equivalent circuit model; Higher-order modes; Impedance bandwidths; Long distance communication; Longitudinal slot; Measured results; Omnidirectional pattern; Transverse slot; Slot antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

A novel frequency reconfigurable Vivaldi antenna that can be used for cognitive radio is explored. In a Cognitive Radio system, the antenna should be capable of sensing the entire bandwidth and should be able to select a specific frequency. In this work, spectrum sensing is carried out by a Vivaldi antenna which is operating for a bandwidth of 2.5-12 GHz. The frequency reconfiguration is achieved by inserting switchable hexagonal slots into the ground plane of the structure. Different frequencies from 2.5-12 GHz can be selected by using PIN diodes. Three pairs of hexagonal slots are introduced in the ground plane and if each pair is connected they will radiate corresponding frequency. The designed antenna can select frequencies 2.6 GHz, 6.6 GHz and 10.6 GHz from the entire bandwidth. The advantage this technique is that a single terminal can operate in different modes. This technique also reduces the interference at the reciever. Simulation of the antenna is done by using Ansoft HFSS 15. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Frequency Reconfiguration; Vivaldi antenna; Wideband Antenna","Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Microwave antennas; Radio systems; Semiconductor diodes; Slot antennas; Different frequency; Frequency Reconfiguration; Radio applications; Single terminal; Specific frequencies; Spectrum sensing; Vivaldi antennas; Wideband antenna; Cognitive radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Simultaneous requests from bus masters, for shared bus, pose a great challenge for on chip communication. Arbiter ease this challenge by deciding who to grant the bus for communication when simultaneous requests are made by bus masters. One of the technique that arbiter follows is the lottery bus arbitration which solves the problem of conventional arbitration techniques such as starvation of low priority and delay of high priority requests. An efficient on chip communication network for SoC (System on Chip) can be designed using lottery bus arbiter that will improve the performance of the system and provides a uniform allocation of shared bus to the requested masters.

These classes are constructed based on the type of finite elements (continuous or nonconforming or discontinuous) used. The proposed solver is compared with the open source direct solvers, MUMPS and PasTiX. Further, the performance of the parallel multigrid solver is analyzed up to 1080 processors.

We present a physical design flow that integrates thermal driven floor-planning with MOEA. The thermal aware floor-planning help reduce the magnitude of hotspots in each layer, in turn, alleviate the negative impact of heat dissipation on chip performance and reliability. The essence of the flow is to analyze the layered thermal map of the chip stack and then apply MOEA operators, which helps to put the power hungry functional units far from each other.3D stacked heterogeneous mesh architecture with 3 layers is used as the baseline for our experimental work. Further another two layers has been added to check the impact of increasing number of layers on the peak temperature of individual layers. The experimental results show the suitability of our algorithm for significantly reducing maximum on-chip temperature.

The requirement of indigenous regional navigational satellite system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite System, like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. Design of IRNSS antenna at user segment is mandatory for Indian region. The IRNSS satellites will be placed at a higher geostationary orbit to have a larger signal footprint and minimum satellites for regional mapping. IRNSS signals will consist of a Special Positioning Service and a Precision Service. Both will be carried on L5 band (1176.45 MHz) and S band (2492.08 MHz). As it is be long range communication system needs high frequency signals and high gain receiving antennas. So, different antennas can be designed to enhance the gain and directivity. Based on this the rectangular Microstrip patch antenna, planar array of patch antennas and planar, wideband feed slot spiral antenna are designed by using various software simulations. Use of array of spiral antennas will increase the gain position. Spiral antennas are comparatively small size and these antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure.

A typical neuron can be divided into functionally three distinct parts called Dendrites, Soma and Axon. Dendrites play the role of input device that collect signals from other neurons and transmits them to soma. Soma performs a Non-linear operation, i.e. if input exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is generated. This output signal is taken over by an output device, the Axon, which delivers the signal to other neurons. This is the basic function of a biological neuron. A biological neuron model which is also known as Spiking Neuron Model is a mathematical description of properties of neuron that is to be designed accurately to describe and predict the biological processes. So there comes the concept of modelling and analysis of neurons. Modelling and analysis of neurons was performed by different researchers on First, Second and Third generation of neurons. The Third generation of neurons are also called as spiking neurons. The focus of this work is to implement different types of spiking neuron models developed by Izhikevich which is a mathematical model and Hodgkin and Huxley which is a biological model. Comparison between these two models in terms of Design implementation has been done.

In the proposed MRB computational rule, the intermediate sum and intermediate carry are obtained in terms of conventional (Posibits) and inverted encoding of Negabits (IEN) representation replacing the redundant digits. The proposed MRB adder is synthesized and simulated using Xilinx-ISE 14.4 software and implemented on vertex-4 FPGA device.

When the radiation in the environment strikes any one of the configuration frames, it would seriously affect the functionality of the SRAM based FPGA which leads to Multiple Bit Upsets (MBUs). These MBUs affect a larger number of configuration frames in SRAM based FPGA. So in order to rebuild the incorrect configuration frames, a lower cost error-correction code is used for the correction and detection of MBUs in configuration frames founded on the conception of Erasure codes. Horizontal and Vertical parity bits has been used to evade redundant data. The proposed scheme does not require any alteration to the FPGA architecture. The only drawback is that, parity bit operation is performed for all the configuration frames even when Single Event Upset is occurred which increases computation time. In order to overcome this drawback, Mutation along with cross over is utilized which is used to correct the single bit errors. Erroneous frames could be corrected from the golden memory reference module. By using the Erasure or Mutation the delay is reduced furtherly. © 2016 IEEE.","DMC; Erasure codes; FPGA; Mutation and cross over; Soft Errors","Codes (symbols); Computer control systems; Error correction; Errors; Forward error correction; Radiation hardening; Static random access storage; Cross over; Erasure codes; Error correction codes; FPGA architectures; Integration scheme; Nanometer technology; Single event upsets; Soft error; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

The power dissipation is expected to increase further in next generation technologies because of the exponential increase in leakage currents with technology scaling. FinFET device was introduced as a suitable replacement of CMOS due to its reduced short channel effects at lower technology nodes. However, leakage current still remains comparable to device ONcurrent at highly scaled technology nodes. Continuous voltage supply to retain the data in SRAM cell contributes a major part of leakage current in any processor design. This paper proposed a novel circuit technique to reduce the leakage current and power consumption of SRAM cell. The proposed design achieves a very high reduction in static power dissipation, up to 4% reduction in read power and upto 49% reduction in write power dissipation as compared to conventional FinFET 6T SRAM cell.

PUFs are useful security architectures used for identification, authentication and cryptographic key generation. Many PUF topologies are proposed in the past targeting both ASIC and FPGA. It is nearly impossible to get two PUF circuits with same characteristics for the same design. PUFs make use of random process variation occurring during manufacturing of IC which is uncontrollable. The most versatile PUF is ring oscillator (RO) PUF, in which the frequencies of ring oscillators are compared to produce the PUF response. The conventional approach consumes large number of ring oscillators and requires all RO's to be mutually symmetric. In this paper, we have proposed a RO-PUF for FPGA devices, which is capable of generating multiple output bits from each ring oscillator with better security metrics in comparison with PUF designed with similar technique.

Even though the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) performs better, DCT computation is faster which entails its use in real time applications. This is especially useful in the internet of things era which require real time processing. As such, it is required to efficiently and swiftly compute the DCT output for which FPGAS prove to be indispensable. Exploiting the use of massive parallelism in an FPGA, we can increase the throughput as well as speed. To achieve this, a novel architecture for the efficient and swift computation of DCT is proposed consisting of 83 pipeline stages and achieving a maximum clock speed of 156.424 MHz simulated in Xilinx ISE Design Suite 13.2 with Spartan 3E as the target FPGA. © 2016 IEEE.","Adders; DCT; FPGA; Multipliers; Pipelining; Real time processing","Adders; Computational efficiency; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency multiplying circuits; Pipe linings; Wavelet transforms; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); FPGA implementations; High throughput; Image compression techniques; Massive parallelism; Novel architecture; Real-time application; Realtime processing; Image compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

This paper introduces two new low power and high speed reconfigurable parametric equalizer designs. These designs are based on the row bypassing multipliers which are implemented using carry save adder (CSA) and ripple carry adder (RCA). The primary power reduction is procured by turning off adders when the multiplier operands are zero. In addition, the proposed equalizers are implemented with parallel architecture of multipliers to shorten the delay time. The proposed designs can be dynamically reconfigured with erratic coefficients that are only constrained by their order and coefficient world length. These parametric equalizers have been implemented and tested on Vertex-IV field programmable gate array (FPGA) board. The efficacy of the proposed design method is presented with an example. The performance of both the designs is evaluated and compared in terms of area (number of slices), speed, i.e., maximum frequency and power consumption. The results depict that the CSA row bypassing multiplier based parametric equalizer achieves 11% speed enhancement and 18% area reduction in comparison with RCA row bypassing multiplier based parametric equalizer. While the power dissipation of the later equalizer is 5% less than the former one. © 2016 IEEE.","carry save adders (CSA); Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Parametric Equalizer IIR digital filters; ripple carry adders (RCA); row bypassing multipliers","Adders; Digital filters; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency multiplying circuits; IIR filters; Logic gates; Parallel architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Area reduction; Carry save adder; IIR digital filters; Maximum frequency; Power reductions; Reconfigurability; Ripple carry adders; Speed enhancement; Equalizers",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

These are growing as complexity and size of SoC is increasing day by day. Mutation testing is popular to find faults in the software program of software system design. There were many attempts to apply the same concept in SoC or embedded SoC testing or verification. In this paper, we are proposing a verification methodology which qualifies tied-off signal values based on mutation testing. The proposed methodology discusses extraction process of tied-off values for different instances of SoC design. Different mutants are generated using inverted value of each tied-off signal per IP instance basis. Later regression is run for each IP per inverted TF signal (bit) value. It helps to list tied-off signals, whose values are insensitive in present testbench/testcases/verification environment for each IP. This testbench infrastructure was implemented for few IP modules of SoCdesign. We have shared implementation details, results and impacts of the proposed methodology. This helps to detect inadequacy of testcase(s)/testbench or verification environment related to tied-off signal faults. It improves the SoC verification quality to high standard. Finally, qualified TF signals can be used to write UVM sequence for relevant IP instances. © 2016 IEEE.","Constant assignment; fixed assignment; Functional Verification; IP design; IP verification; Logic Simulation; Mutation Analysis; RTL; SoC integration; SoC Verification; Tied off signal; Universal Verification Methodology; UVM; vcd","Software testing; System-on-chip; Constant assignment; fixed assignment; Functional verification; IP design; Logic simulations; Mutation analysis; SOC integration; SoC verification; Universal verification; Integrated circuit design","Ghosh, P.; Freescale Semiconductor (Part of NXP Semiconductor)India; email: prokash.ghosh@nxp.com","Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Power supply noise (PSN) is an important issue among all the issues in today's application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) design. Present trends in VLSI design are inclined towards the placement of decoupling capacitors for multi-core design. An early prediction and estimation of decoupling capacitance in the pre-layout stage of the design can provide a better scope in optimizing power, noise and delay effects for the circuit. In this paper, we investigate the change in noise and delay parameters with and without the decap allocation for multi-core circuit at the pre-layout stage. Here a 1024 point FFT core is considered as an example for our test circuits as they are quite complex in nature and are also used as custom cores in many applications. To the best of our knowledge PDN analysis for execution time and noise suppression on FFT application cores is not available in related research works. The novelty of our work lies in the fact that by using our approaches noise can be suppressed approximately by 37% on an average at the prelayout stage and 1.84% increase in increase in propagation delay when compared to the original circuitry. This early prediction of CAD implementation helps to create more accurate designs at the layout stage and hence this work can serve as benchmarks for PDN analysis. © 2016 IEEE.","Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); FFT core; Power Distribution Network (PDN); Power Supply Noise (PSN); Ultra low power","Application specific integrated circuits; Artificial intelligence; Capacitance; Capacitance measurement; Complex networks; Computer aided design; Delay circuits; Fast Fourier transforms; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit layout; Integrated circuit testing; Power supply circuits; Spurious signal noise; De-coupling capacitance; Decoupling capacitor; Delay estimation; Noise suppression; Power distribution network; Power-supply noise; Propagation delays; Ultra low power; Low power electronics",,"Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509010479,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

FPGAs and Emulation systems offer a great help to verification and validation engineers to achieve the same in the VLSI design flow. Further, to enable design verification engineers to create close to real chip scenarios and interface with external peripherals like UART, JTAG, protocol and memory solutions further increases the need for FPGA or Emulation builds earlier in the design cycle. For accelerating smaller designs like IPs, FPGAs could suffice but for running complex SoCs, multi device FPGA architectures or Emulation systems might be needed.

The need of change in radiation parameters of an antenna like frequency, polarization, radiation pattern or combination of these parameters, on board had given rise to design reconfigurable antennas. This reconfiguration on antenna is achieved by switching feed location of an antenna or switching ground or switching the radiating path of an antenna which brings change in the effective resonating length. The switching can be done by using PIN diodes, varactor diodes, optical switches and MEMS to connect/disconnect different parts on an antenna. Due to this the total antenna volume of printed reconfigurable antenna can be reused to achieve different antenna modes. Thus, printed reconfigurable antenna integrates functional diversities to accommodate the increasing demands of modern wireless applications like software defined radio, cognitive radio, fading, noise interference, MIMO with a small form factor. © 2016 IEEE.","DGS; frequency reconfigurable; pattern reconfigurable; pin diodes; polarization reconfigurable; RF switches; slots; varactor diodes","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive radio; Diodes; Fading (radio); Microstrip antennas; MIMO systems; MOEMS; Optical switches; Polarization; Semiconductor diodes; Software radio; Switching; Varactors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Pattern-reconfigurable; PiN diode; Reconfigurable; RF switch; slots; Varactor diodes; Directional patterns (antenna)",,"Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509010479,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Then a U-slot is etched into the patch to make it into dual band antenna. The U slot antenna resonates in the frequency band of 2-3 GHz having a return of -11.87 dB and -8.12 dB at 2.70 GHz and 3.81 GHz respectively. Then both antennas are then converted into their parallel RLC equivalent whose insight makes the complex analysis of RF harvesting system comparatively easier. The values of RLC circuit for the coaxial fed antenna are calculated as R = 13.30 ohm, L= 14.06pH and C= 300pF. While converting the U-slot antenna into its corresponding RLC, an additional inductor and capacitor are added in series with the original L and C of the RLC circuit. So multiple resonances occur in the circuit which explains that a single coaxial fed antenna is converted into dual band by etching U slot on it. © 2016 IEEE.","Rectenna; RF harvesting; U-slot","Antenna feeders; Circuit resonance; Frequency bands; Microwave antennas; Resonant circuits; Slot antennas; Timing circuits; Complex analysis; Dual band antennas; Harvesting system; Multiple resonances; Rectangular patch antenna; Rectenna; U-slot antennas; U-slot patch antenna; Microstrip antennas",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Adders are one of the basic fundamental component in such circuit, designing much efficient Adder results in optimizing whole circuit. Due to rapid growth in technology there is a need of fast processing arithmetic unit, so Carry Select Adder (CSLA) is one of the fast processing adder. By observing the CSLA circuitry it is noticed that, further optimization can be achieved in various criteria. Power dissipation results only when bits are lost while processing, as per Launder's principle, KTln2 heat is dissipated if there is any loss in bit. Since conventional CSLA is designed using irreversible logic gates which it results much more power dissipation but it can be overcome by employing reversible logic to reduce power dissipation till some extent.

The time has come to break one of the famous Silicon Valley golden rules which states ""Higher the clock frequency, Greater the power consumption"". Keeping the trivial relationship between power consumption and power dissipation in mind, lowering supply voltages is the most effective method to reduce power consumption. At lower supply voltage, it is challenging to optimize each block of PLL for Low Voltage operations. A Low voltage High Frequency ALF Charge Pump PLL is proposed.

An ordinary neuron consists of three different parts Dendrites, Soma and Axon. Each part is having its role in transferring the information. The connection between the neurons can be either Dendrite-Axon or Dendrite-Dendrite or Axon-Axon. Dendrites have the pivotal role in collecting the signals from other neurons and transmitting them to soma which implies that the dendrites act as an input device to the neuron. Soma performs a Non-linear operation, i.e. if input exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is generated. The Axon performs the role of an output device which takes the processed signal from soma and transmitting it to the other neurons. This is the basic function of a biological neuron.

This technology also used for capturing brain signals in the form of EEG. This technique have intensive applications in non-invasive technique of signal capturing, Due to its temporal resolution, low set-up cost, easy portability compared to all other techniques. In the EEG technique, as we are dealing with very low frequency signals, these signals have plagued with various noise and interferences, so there is an urge for designing and implementing an accurate and stabilized system for acquiring these low frequency signals. This paper is aiming for VLSI design and testing of EEG acquisition system to acquire brain signals. Initially the low power and high gain generalized operational amplifier is designed. Later a suitable filter is designed to eliminate the noise signals produced in low frequency operations, in order to capture EEG signals. The generalized amplifier design of this system consists of differential amplifier followed with voltage follower circuit. The above circuit is designed using the Cadence tool which facilitates the capturing of transient response and generation of virtual layouts. Each and every blocks of the system is designed and tested individually, for each blocks virtual layouts are generated. And the transient response of the system which contains EEG signals with different voltage levels and frequencies are captured. © 2016 IEEE.","Band stop filter; BCI; Electro encephalography; Instrumentation amplifier; Very large scale integration","Amplifiers (electronic); Brain computer interface; Buffer amplifiers; Differential amplifiers; Integrated circuit design; Mergers and acquisitions; Notch filters; Operational amplifiers; Signal processing; Transient analysis; VLSI circuits; Band-stop filters; Brain-computer interfacing; Different voltages; Instrumentation amplifier; Low-frequency signals; Noninvasive technique; Temporal resolution; Very low frequency; Biomedical signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

One of the fundamental requirements is to execute security algorithms in isolation but with rest of the applications running in any high assurance system. Typically, this requirement is realized by physical separation achieved using a separate security co-processor or FPGAS with dedicated memory, however this increases the overall cost, hardware complexity, size and power requirements in an embedded system. This paper demonstrates realization of security primitive (isolation and controlled sharing) on a reconfigurable platform (read FPGA) for a practical real world crypto system.

The current paper focuses on the digital implementation details on the Lightning Sensor Node. The data acquisition and processing is carried out on the Kintex-7 FPGA. The setup comprises of a cRIO-9030 chassis along with the I/O modules mounted on it and a Kintex-7 FPGA. The various data acquisition steps and the processing algorithm have been implemented on the Kintex-7 FPGA. The cRio-9030 controller is only used for handling the communication from the Controller to the PC using Ethernet. The data acquisition basically comprises of sampling using ADC at the rate of 1 MS/s using NI 9223 ADC module and GPS time stamping for relevant sample value acquired using the ADC module. The NI 9467 module is used for the GPS time stamping purpose. The sampling at such a high rate results in a lot of unwanted data being buffered and tends to increase the processing overhead. Hence, we have further implemented a smart triggering on the FPGA. The FPGA now sends a limited chunk of data in the form of a frame consisting of 35 data points along with the relevant timestamps in microseconds. The data obtained after applying the Smart Triggering algorithm is now dispatched to the cRIO controller using the FPGA to Real Time DMA FIFO. The DMA FIFO used here initiates a high speed data transfer. The cRIO is now utilized to reconstruct the timestamps and data values obtained from the FPGA and later implement the communication to the PC using Ethernet. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud to Ground Lightning; FPGA to RT DMA FIFO; Local FIFO; Network Streams; Smart Triggering","Clouds; Controllers; Data acquisition; Data transfer; Ethernet; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Lightning; Sensor nodes; Stamping; Cloud-to-ground lightning; Digital implementation; High speed data acquisition; High-speed data transfer; Local FIFO; Network streams; Processing algorithms; Smart Triggering; Data handling",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This in particular is true for many microprocessors, where the on chip memory size is growing with every generation to reduce the constant variance in speeds of processor and main memory. Due to improved integration, operating speeds and power dissipation have become important factors to consider in designing. In process of reducing power and delay change of topologies and scaling w/l ratio were instrumental. In this paper for the traditional 6TSRAM circuit, extra transistors are added for reset operation. In the proposed 2D SRAM with reset, to decrease the delay of the circuit biasing is done for both PMOS and NMOS using Gate Level Body Biasing (GLBB). The proposed system is designed using gpdk180 in Cadence. The functionality of the design verified using Cadence Spectre tool. The circuit has average power of 489uW with delay of 20.14ns (for d-in to d-out), 20.14ns (for write to d-out) and 44.55ps (for read to d-out). After body biasing the average power is 83.43mW (increased by 82.941mW) and delay is 20.13ns (for din to d-out: decreased by 10ps), 20.13ns (for write to d-out: decreased by 10ps) and 27.26ps (for d-in to d-out: decreased by 17.29ps). By applying the biasing the speed is increased at the cost of power. For reducing the power the transistors are sized 800nm for PMOS and 400nm for NMOS.

The function of arbiters is to resolve contention among different i/o ports accessing a common resource. Digital circuits such as multiplexers are building blocks for the implementation of such arbiters in order to provide the best connectivity. The major challenge for the design of on-chip arbiters is to keep the overall area overhead at the minimum level. In this paper we have proposed an optimized design for 4:1 MUX using Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology. QCA is an emerging nanoscale technology which provides advantages such as extremely small size, low power consumption and very high speed. The proposed design has been simulated with QCADesigner tool. From the simulation results it can be derived that the proposed 4:1 MUX occupies 0.97844 μm2 area which is 18% lesser than the previous most efficient design.

For Coplanar full adder, 95 cells occupying 0.12μm2 area and for 4-bit RCA 366 cells covers 0.50μm2 area are obtained. QCA Designer tool is used for designing, evaluation and testing of our design. Simulation result shows a very robust design of our coplanar adder. © 2016 IEEE.","Coplanar adder; Quantum-dot cellular automata; Ripple carry adder","Cellular automata; CMOS integrated circuits; Integrated circuit design; Nanocrystals; Semiconductor quantum dots; Dot cellular automaton; Emerging technologies; Heat and power; Performance degradation; Physical realization; Quantum dot cellular automata; Ripple carry adders; Scaling problem; Adders",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

As the number of cells are increasing due to increase in design complexity and size, this problem is gaining importance. Typically placement of blocks in FPGA are based on simulated annealing algorithms. Since the FPGA designs are smaller compared with their ASIC counterparts, simulated annealing algorithms are feasible as the runtime to place them is less. However, as the design size and complexity is increasing, simulated annealing algorithms and genetic programming based algorithms tend to be slower. In this paper, our work is targetted towards improving the runtime of placement in FPGAs. We propose a novel algorithm which is based on nonlinear analytical methods. This method uses density penalty approach, wherein, the spreading of blocks across the die is controlled by the square of penalty for the uneven regions across the die. Our method is fast and, when compared with VPR, we improve the runtime by 750% while providing a reasonably good solution for the placement. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.",,"Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Integrated circuit design; Optimization; Simulated annealing; VLSI circuits; Analytical method; Analytical optimizations; Design complexity; Design flows; Design size; FPGA design; Novel algorithm; Simulated annealing algorithms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Pawanekar, S.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: p.sameer@iitg.ernet.in","Kaushik B.K.Dasgupta S.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811074691,,,"English","Commun.

The proposed GRIN is designed by using a parallel-line unit cell metamaterial with different refractive index. A seven GRIN lens is placed on the omnidirectional printed basic monopole antenna, perpendicularly. Due to the non-resonant and subwavelength properties of the parallel-line elements, the proposed GRIN metamaterial lens has a broad bandwidth property with low loss. The simulation and measurement results confirmed that the beam is more directive with narrow beam width. The measured reflection coefficient of the GRIN antenna is below -10 dB over the frequency bandwidth of 3.4-11 GHz. Due to GRIN lens, the peak gain of the basic monopole antenna is increased by 5.3 dB at 8.8 GHz. © 2013 IEEE.","gradient refractive index; lens; metamaterial; Monopole antenna; subwavelength","Antennas; Bandwidth; Directive antennas; Lenses; Metamaterial antennas; Metamaterials; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Monopole antennas; Omnidirectional antennas; Refractive index; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Broad bandwidths; Frequency band width; Gradient refractive index; Metamaterial lens; Novel techniques; Simulations and measurements; Sub-wavelength; Ultrawideband applications; Lens antennas","Singha, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: ieee.rahul5488@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028821832

Degree of focus in an image plays a very important role in determining the image quality, thus focusing mechanism is a very important requirement in thermal imagers. A real-time and reliable passive autofocus algorithm has been developed and implemented in FPGA-based hardware. This autofocus module has been integrated with the video processing pipeline of thermal imagers. Prior to the hardware implementation, different algorithms for image sharpness evaluation have been implemented in MATLAB and simulations have been done with test video sequences acquired by a thermal imager with motorized focus control to analyze the algorithms efficiency. Cumulative gradient algorithm has been developed for image sharpness evaluation. The algorithm has been tested on images taken from a thermal imager under varying contrast and background conditions, and it shows high precision and good discriminating power. The images have been prefiltered by a median rank-order filter using a 3 × 3 matrix to make it more robust in handling noisy images. Complete autofocus algorithm design comprising of a frame acquisition module for acquiring user selectable central region in the incoming thermal imager video, Cumulative Gradient-based image sharpness evaluation module, fixed step size search-based focal plane search module and a motor pulse generation module for generating motor drives have been implemented on Xilinx FPGA device XC4VLX100 using Xilinx ISE EDA tool. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Autofocus; DRC; FPGA; Gradient; IR; MATLAB; NUC; VHDL","Computer aided software engineering; Computer hardware; Computer hardware description languages; Computer vision; Electric drives; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gradient methods; Hardware; Image quality; Integrated circuit design; Iridium; MATLAB; Median filters; Pipeline processing systems; Video signal processing; Auto-focus; Auto-focus algorithm; Background conditions; Design and implementations; Discriminating power; Focusing mechanisms; Gradient algorithm; Hardware implementations; Image processing","Srivastava, A.K.; Instruments Research and Development EstablishmentIndia; email: anurag@irde.drdo.in","Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811021039,,,"English","Adv.

The single precision floating point arithmetic operations are multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. Among all these multiplication is extensively used and involves composite arithmetic functions. The single precision (32-bit) floating point number split into three parts namely Sign part, and Exponent part and Mantissa part. The most significant bit of the number is a sign bit and it is a 1-bit length. Next 8-bits represent the exponent part of the number and next 23-bits represent the mantissa part of the number. Mantissa part needs large 24-bit multiplication. The performance of the single-precision floating point number mostly based on the occupied area and delay of the multiplier. In this paper, performance comparison of multiplexer based single precision floating point multiplication using Array, Wallace tree and Vedic multipliers is done in terms of area and delay. These floating point multipliers modules are programmed and synthesized using Verilog in Xilinx ISE Simulator. Maximum propagated path delay and number of slices required on FPGA are compared for different multipliers.

Secondly, we proposed a novel heuristic based allocation mechanism, TAMF (Task Allocation Mechanism for FPGA based heterogeneous SOC).

This paper presents dynamic reconfigurable register file allocation in hyper pipelined OR1200 (Open RISC) for single instruction multiple data (SIMD). The OR1200 instantly reconfigures the actual register file to the reconfigurable register file according to the requirement of the application. The unused general purpose registers obtained during the reconfiguration process can be used for hyper pipelining technique which improves overall performance of the single core processor system. Thus releasing the unused register reduces the power consumption and increases the execution speed of OR1200. This proposed reconfigurable technique is implemented using Verilog and it is tested using MediaBench multimedia benchmark dataset which ensures reduced register utilisation of 16.80% for multimedia dataset and power reduction up to 72.7% with reconfigurable modules. The proposed technique is configured in Virtex-6 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and results are analysed with the existing and proposed reconfigured OR1200.

Dynamic power in digital programmable CMOS-based processors depends on the switching activity. Specifically in its subcomponents like FIR filter, power consumption can be directly related to the node switching activity. Minimization of power consumption can be done by reducing the transitions or dissimilarities in filter coefficients. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been found to be very effective for optimized FIR filter design because of nonlinear, nondifferentiable, multimodal and nonconvex nature of the associated optimization problem. However, all the existing evolutionary optimization-based design techniques aim at meeting the frequency domain specifications without concentrating on minimizing power consumption. In the present work, a novel EA, i.e., hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm, has been proposed and further applied for FIR filter design.

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checksum) is an efficient and simple cryptic algorithm has been in use among the software community since very long time to detect malicious changes in transmitted data. Recently hardware engineers are also interested in using it in their forward error detection scheme with low resource consumption overhead for their ultra high-speed data communication. To tap the full potential of CRC algorithm in hardware level, it must be implemented in a hardware friendly manner with proper user constraints. This paper presents a very high throughput low latency VLSI design architecture of CRC-32 with reconfigurable parameters. The high throughput is achieved by using expandable data bus line. While, low latency is made possible by parallelizing the logic implementation. The way this problem is approached is elegantly explained using detailed diagrams and mathematics, such that the readers find it easy to adapt the architecture to any CRC polynomial type/size. The uniqueness of our design lies in its ability to operate on the same clock cycle in which the code word is presented, with results produced in immediately next clock cycle. The effects of variations in design parameters of CRC VLSI design on performance characteristics is studied. Also, we have further extended the scope of utility of this component by modeling test scenarios where our CRC logic core is encapsulated to suit different interface standards and how its efficiency changes with chosen interface. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Big data application; CRC-32; Cyclic redundancy code (CRC); Error detection; FPGA; High data rate; Re-configurable architecture; VLSI design","Big data; Clocks; Computer circuits; Computer hardware; Embedded systems; Error detection; Errors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Reconfigurable architectures; Redundancy; Throughput; VLSI circuits; Big data applications; Configurable architectures; CRC-32; Cyclic redundancy codes; High data rate; VLSI design; Reconfigurable hardware","Mitra, J.; Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, HBNI, 1/AF Bidhannagar, India; email: jm61288@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01679260,,IVJOD,,"English","Integr VLSI J",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988527587

Conventional works estimate motion using nearest neighbourhood search where the computation of search locations has high complexity. The novelty of the proposed work is to accelerate the estimation process using mixed parallel and pipeline processing with TCAM. This technique searches the pixel variations between current and different reference blocks of a frame simultaneously by checking complete match case as well as partial match case. If matching is found in the same location of block space then there is no motion and if matching is found in different location of block space other than the existing location then it is considered that motion has occurred. Further, if motion occurs in more than one location then the best match is found by Sum of Absolute difference (SAD) between the blocks of pixels of size 8 × 8 Motion vectors are computed for complete as well as partial match of 8 × 8 block within two 16 × 16 blocks. A TCAM engine is designed to store the pixels of the reference frame. Afterwards a search operation is performed using a current block of size 16 × 16 with two reference blocks of size 16 × 16 or one 32 × 16 The number of clock cycles consumed for this operation is 382. It is observed that the consumption of hardware resources is 33%. The complete architecture is designed in verilog and it is implemented in FPGA Virtex-7 and ASIC. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC); Block matching algorithm (BMA); Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Sum of absolute difference (SAD); Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Application specific integrated circuits; Associative storage; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Location; Memory architecture; Motion estimation; Pipeline processing systems; Pixels; Ternary content adressable memory; Video signal processing; VLSI circuits; Block matching algorithms; Design and implementations; Estimation process; Neighbourhood search; Number of clock cycles; Parallel and pipeline; Sum of absolute differences; Ternary content addressable memory; Logic gates","Rangababu, P.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Bijini complex, India; email: p.rangababu@gmail.com","Kaushik B.K.Dasgupta S.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811074691,,,"English","Commun.

At present, the low power SoCs use millions of isolation cells to implement different power gating modes and the isolation cells occupy considerable silicon area of the SoC. Also, the isolation values in low power designs are pre-determined (either fixed to ‘0’ or ‘1’ in design itself) and are non-configurable in real time operation. Hence, any incorrect isolation value may render the device useless in low power modes. In this paper, we propose a modified clamping circuit design to reduce the area and delay of the isolation cells. We also propose a method to configure the isolation values for certain qualifier signals and the subsequent entry process of the power gated modules into deep-sleep mode.

Alternately, the speed of the FFT can be increased using Radix-2 decimation-in-frequency (DIF) FFT algorithm with Multipath Delay Commutator (R2MDC) architecture. In this paper, a novel FFT scheme which combines the R2MDC architecture with the serial version of mixed radix FFT scheme is proposed. To study the efficacy of this approach, an 8-point FFT is implemented using R2MDC architecture. Using this, 16-point, 32-point and 64-point FFTs are realized with the serial version of mixed radix scheme and also using only R2MDC architecture on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. From the implementation results, it is found that the hardware requirement for the proposed approach reduces by 25%–53% at the cost of speed compared to the other schemes reported in the literature including that using only R2MDC architecture.

This results in design bugs also known as extrinsic hardware faults to escape into the processor chip in spite of various levels of testing. Hence, handling design bugs efficiently on the field is a necessity in modern multi-core processors. In this paper, an architecture and algorithm for self-repairing of design bugs in the data path using FPGA is proposed. The FPGA is re-configured during the run-time to take over the functions of the faulty component. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed design a representative sample of five faults are injected and handled.

The primary intension is to compute the FFT of the individual non-overlapped parts (i.e., half of the original segments) and acquire the FFT of the overlapped segments by merging those of the non-overlapped segments. In this paper, initially the input discrete signal is subjected to an L/2-point FFT and then the two successive segments are merged to L-point segment using a modified architecture utilizing an improved Fractional Delay Filter(FDF) design by adapting a Multiplier less implementation for efficient contribution. The merged segments are then subjected to a window filter, designed using delay lines and shifters replacing the multiplier blocks. Finally the power spectral density (PSD) is computed by computing the periodogram and then averaging the periodogram for the windowed segments. Complete module is realized using Xilinx-ISE software with the target device as xc4vfx100-12-ff1152. The design is coded in verilog HDL. The functional verification of the proposed design reported a PSD with an error of 5.87% when compared with the similar Matlab PSD computation.

However, in real designs with complex architectures, MBFFs approach without the full awareness of placement and clock tree information may adversely affect the design attributes. This includes heavy congestion post clock tree synthesis (CTS), long wire-lengths leading to higher voltage drop and timing violations. This paper introduces a novel placement methodology, integrated with existing electronic design automation (EDA) flow and tools, for MBFF generation with prerequisite knowledge of clock tree architecture. In addition, an algorithm for minimizing the clock insertion delay (CID) of the design is proposed. The algorithm reduces the CID by identifying the clock tree nets and the clock tree sinks which violate the CID at the early CTS stage. The proposed methodology is validated on two different designs which are complex and target real applications. The proposed methodology leads to 50.46% and 37.7% reduction in flip-flop power consumption for design I and II, respectively. Furthermore, the core density has improved by 12.8% and 9.8% for design I and II, respectively. An average reduction of 9.2% in the CID validates the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Clock tree synthesis; Congestion; Multibit flip-flops; Placement; System-on-chip","Clock distribution networks; Clocks; Complex networks; Computer aided design; Electric clocks; Electric power utilization; Flip flop circuits; Forestry; Network architecture; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Timing circuits; Trees (mathematics); VLSI circuits; Clock tree synthesis; Complex architectures; Congestion; Design attributes; Multi-bits; Placement; Real applications; System on chip design; Integrated circuit design","Gulati, J.K.; Indraprastha Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: jasmine1481@iiitd.ac.in","Kaushik B.K.Dasgupta S.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811074691,,,"English","Commun.

Nanoscale alternatives arise due to the fact that CMOS is near to face serious challenges due to the scaling limitation of this technology. The nanoscale implementation of CMOS also suffers from high power dissipation. In this present article, a study has been carried out over the structural advantages of square shaped 2Dot 1Electron QCA cells over the rectangular shaped cell. As an case study, a design strategy of a half subtractor as well as a full subtractor has been proposed using 2Dot 1Electron QCA and an analysis has been carried out with respect to the cell structure. The design of the half subtractor consists of only 25 many number of 2Dot 1Electron QCA cells. On the other hand, the full subtractor design contains 40 many number of cells. Using this design approach, we have achieved upto 67% and 65% of efficiency with respect to the cell count over the existing half and full subtractor implementation using 4-dot 2 electron QCA respectively.

To design these mega functional systems, the common bus architecture poses a serious problem in terms of latency and throughput. To overcome the disadvantages of the common bus architecture, a new paradigm in ASIC design called the Network-on-Chip (NoC) was proposed. Several topologies like 2D mesh, torus, etc., were used to interconnect the different modules of the design using this novel idea. These topologies underperformed when scaled. This paper proposes a new architecture RiCoBiT: Ring Connected Binary Tree. It is a new scalable, structured architecture for Network-on-Chip based systems. An optimal routing algorithm for it has been designed. The paper discusses the different properties and performance parameters like maximum hop count, average hop count, number of wire segments, and wire length used to interconnect the nodes of RiCoBiT. These parameters are compared with that of 2D mesh and torus. The paper also discusses and bounds real-time parameters like latency and throughput. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Architecture; Network-on-chip; Topology","Architecture; Binary trees; Computer architecture; Integrated circuit interconnects; Mesh generation; Network architecture; Network-on-chip; Servers; Topology; Bus architecture; Functional systems; High complexity; High performance computing systems; Network on chip (NoC); Optimal routing algorithm; Performance parameters; Scalable architectures; Integrated circuit design","Sanju, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science (MITS), Varikoli, India; email: sanjuv@mgits.ac.in","Bhateja V.Satapathy S.C.Joshi A.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811016776,,,"English","Adv.

In wind power production system the output is depends upon the nature of source called wind. But that source is not constant one. It may be varying depending upon the climate. Due to that oscillation the output voltage from the generator side is instability. These problems are becoming a more serious concern with the ever-increasing utilization and higher loading of existing transmission systems, particularly with increasing energy wastage, energy demands, and competitive generation and supply requirements. Our aim is to improve power system voltage stability by enhancing generator reactive, active power control and voltage control. Adaptive feedback system along with the HSVC ways to improve power system voltage stability by enhancing generator controls in the wind power station. To solve this problem adaptive exciter system are used which will adjust the load voltage and the system voltage with that of the reference voltage. The generator output voltage is applied to the adaptive exciter controller (AEC) which updates its stability weight value on demand.

Out of several factors responsible for huge power drainage the branch prediction unit of a processor contributes almost 10% of the overall power dissipation. This work aims to analyse the impact of inaccurate/faulty design on the branch predictors’ power dissipation while realising speculative execution. The issue has been addressed through introduction of probable faults in a predictor that lead to mis-speculation. The prediction mechanism in CMPs also plays a role in dead-block identification, that is to avoid unutilised power consumption in a system as well as to overcome the poor cache efficiency. The performance loss of a system due to design inaccuracies/faults in dead-block prediction is also evaluated. The detail analysis reveals that the design inaccuracies of a predictor can cause a huge power loss, even up to 95%. The additional power loss in a processor can effectively be sensed to enable diagnosis of the faulty module (design inaccuracies) of predictor as well as to frame guidelines for operating mode of a CMP’s cache system.

This degradation is a spatially varying phenomena, which makes this problem non trivial. Dehazing is an essential preprocessing stage in applications such as long range imaging, border security, intelligent transportation system, etc. However, these applications require low latency of the preprocessing block. In this work, single image dark channel prior algorithm is modified and implemented for fast processing with comparable visual quality of the restored image/video. Although conventional single image dark channel prior algorithm is computationally expensive, it yields impressive results. Moreover, a two stage image dehazing architecture is introduced, wherein, dark channel and airlight are estimated in the first stage. Whereas, transmission map and intensity restoration are computed in the next stages. The algorithm is implemented using Xilinx Vivado software and validated by using Xilinx zc702 development board, which contains an Artix7 equivalent Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and ARM Cortex A9 dual core processor. Additionally, high definition multimedia interface (HDMI) has been incorporated for video feed and display purposes. The results show that the dehazing algorithm attains 29 frames per second for the image resolution of 1920x1080 which is suitable of real time applications. The design utilizes 9 18K-BRAM, 97 DSP-48, 6508 FFs and 8159 LUTs. © 2017 SPIE.","FPGA; HDMI input/output; image dehazing; video processing; Xilinx high level synthesis (HLS) library","Demulsification; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); High level synthesis; Image resolution; Intelligent systems; Restoration; Video signal processing; Dehazing; Dual core processors; FPGA implementations; High-definition multimedia interfaces; Input/output; Intelligent transportation systems; Real-time application; Video processing; Image processing",,"Tescher A.G.","SPIE",0277786X,9781510612495,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034737137

Basically, we initiated from designing a meander monopole antenna. Afterwards impedance-adjustment structure is added, the resulting antenna can be viewed as a printed planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA). The required impedance band can be produced by the simulated antenna to resonate band no. 28 and 2.4GHz ISM band. The measurement was found to agree reasonably well with the simulation.

By combining elements in a phased array beamforming is achieved. This is done in such a way that, signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. To detect and calculate the signal-of-interest at the output of a sensor array by means of the most desirable spatial filtering and interference rejection, adaptive beamforming is used. But, before beamforming technique, the directions of desired users and undesired users or interferes must be prevailed using a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm. This paper presents FPGA realisation-based design of a smart antenna system based on DOA estimation algorithm using Xilinx system generator (XSG). MUSIC algorithm is considered in this paper to identify the DOA of the input signals incident on the sensor array comprising the smart antenna system. The MUSIC algorithm is a simple and effective eigen structure method of DOA estimation. With this approach, the results of proposed simulated FPGA design of a smart antenna system shows effective hardware utilisation. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","DOA estimation; MUSIC algorithm; Smart antenna system; Xilinx system generator; XSG","Antenna phased arrays; Antennas; Beam forming networks; Beamforming; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; Constructive interference; Direction of arrivalestimation(DOA); DOA estimation; MUSIC algorithms; Signal processing technique; Smart antenna systems; Xilinx system generator; Xilinx system generators (XSG); Direction of arrival","Thiripurasundari, C.; Department of ECE, Madha Engineering CollegeIndia; email: rndthiripurasundari@gmail.com",,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",14709503,,,,"English","Int.

The parameters which are evaluated in this work are transfer characteristics, noise margin, propagation delay, inverter current and amplifier gain. Apart from this, influence of gate oxide permittivity on the transfer characteristics of CMOS inverter has been investigated. Presented results show that, the variation in the doping profile (i.e. from uniform to Gaussian) has lesser impact on the device performance.

In a large volume of population, it is impossible to provide any kind of information via mouth regularly, so there is a need for some substitute, which would easily convey the message to the crowd without any regular human/PC interference. The paper focuses on the design, and hardware implementation of LED matrix-based display system, which is developed to display information regularly or the message in scrolling form.

This necessitated miniature size antennas for use with wireless communication equipments. Many researchers have worked and are working on printed monopole slot antennas to achieve small size and acceptable performance. In this regard several investigations are carried out to ascertain the effect of slot position on antenna performance. In addition to this bevel slots are cut at corners and its effect on antenna performance is studied. Compact wideband antennas are gaining popularity in view of their features like large bandwidth, low power consumption, low complexity, low cost etc. Many researches are working to obtain an optimum arrangement for the UWB monopole antenna. In this paper several configurations of wideband antennas are designed, tested and their performance is compared. One arrangement is a compact patch with slot cut at different locations. Another arrangement is the earlier one with two symmetrical bevel cuts on the lower edge of the radiating element. In both schemes a defective ground plane structure (DGS) is used. Further the ground plane dimensions are varied and effect of this on performance is studied. The design and performance evaluation is carried out using HFSS software. The results are presented and discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","bevel cuts; Defective ground plane structure; returns loss; UWB","Antenna grounds; Defects; Microstrip antennas; Monopole antennas; Slot antennas; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Wireless telecommunication systems; Acceptable performance; bevel cuts; Defective ground planes; Low-power consumption; Performance evaluations; Printed monopole slot antennas; Returns loss; Wireless communications; Defected ground structures",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

A unified compact model included all the nanoscale effects (e.g. short channel effects, mobility degradation, velocity saturations etc.) as well as the parasitic capacitance and resistance model, which are highly dominant in lower technology nodes. The compact model is well matched with TCAD simulation data at 10nm VNW FET device level. The cell library builds comprises of INVERTER, NAND, NOR and Ex-OR gate cells.

Host image is divided in to (8 × 8) non overlapping blocks and 2-D DCT is performed. The nonzero AC coefficients of a block are modulated based on modulation factor. The amount of quality degradation governs by modulation factor and interns perform quality access control. The modulated coefficients are Huffman coded for efficient storage and transmissions. All the necessary information are encoded and send to the decoder as a secret key along with the Huffman coded coefficient. User having the full knowledge of the key can demodulate to access full quality of image.

The assembly programs take significant amount of time to execute. To reduce the execution time, these programs are being parallelised to take advantage of many cores available in present day processor chips. Further, hardware accelerators have been developed which when used along with processors speed up the execution. Velvet is a commonly used software for de novo assembly. We propose a novel method to reduce the overall time of assembly by using FPGAs.

Embedded NVM provides better security, SOC specific customization, and better integration to other SOC components. It also interacts with many critical modules, like Power Management Controller (PMC), Reset-sequencing State control machine, etc.; while also playing a very important role in power-up sequencing and mode transitions of the chip, since it contains the analog trimming, firmware and final customer application code. The NVM is a big complex component containing Digital and Analog sections, along with Bitcell Arrays and multiplexers. Once integrated in a SOC, it is quite important to check proper functioning of SOC and NVM across power-up and low-power-mode transitions. At present, NVM verification at IP level is done in parts, with individual sub-modules tested separately and limited verification of complete NVM IP after its sub-modules modules are stitched together. At SOC level, verification is done using behavioral model of NVM, which again loses electrical aspect of the signals. Thus mixed-mode simulations at SOC-level are needed for NVM. But, taking the entire NVM-Array in SPICE is an un-necessary load of millions of MOSFETs on the simulator, and beyond the capacity of many tools. The repeated memory-bank-structures do contain a lot of analog circuitry, and optimized techniques can allow for a simulation friendly design-size. We have developed method to model the NVM which allow us to run Chip-level simulations with a SPICE & Verilog-A/AMS views of the NVM.

However, to achieve this integration and make them easy to program, we first need to enable users with varying expertise to easily develop cloud applications that leverage FPGAs. With the growing size of FPGAs, allocating them monolithically to users can be wasteful due to potentially low device utilization. Hence, we also need to be able to dynamically share FPGAs among multiple users. To address these concerns, we propose a methodology and a runtime system that together simplify the FPGA application development process by providing: 1) a clean abstraction with high-level APIs for easy application development; 2) a simple execution model that supports both hardware and software execution; and 3) a shared memory-model which is convenient to use for the programmers. Akin to an operating system on a computer, our lightweight runtime system enables the simultaneous execution of multiple applications by virtualizing computational resources, i.e., FPGA resources and on-board memory, and offers protection facilities to isolate applications from each other. In this paper, we illustrate how these features can be developed in a lightweight manner and quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead they introduce on a small set of applications running on our proof of concept prototype. Our results demonstrate that these features only introduce marginal performance overheads. More importantly, by sharing resources for simultaneous execution of multiple user applications, our platform improves FPGA utilization and delivers higher aggregate throughput compared to accessing the device in a time-shared manner. © 2013 IEEE.","Field programmable gate arrays; platform virtualization; reconfigurable architectures; runtime environment","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer operating systems; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Memory architecture; Reconfigurable architectures; Software prototyping; Aggregate throughput; Application development; Computational resources; Hardware and software; Multiple applications; Platform virtualization; Runtime environments; Shared memory model; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Asiatici, M.; School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)Switzerland; email: mikhail.asiatici@epfl.ch",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015797434
