Inductors constitute an essential part of a RF front ends. Employment of spiral inductors has put several limitations on such RF circuits. Spiral inductors are fixed, bulky, cover large area and can’t be scaled with the process technologies. Also, due to the resistive losses and substrate losses, the quality factor is limited. An alternate way to emulate inductor behavior is using active inductors. Active inductors are area-efficient, support tunable inductance, quality factor, self-resonant frequency and can be scaled with process technologies. However, the active inductors are too sensitive to process, supply voltage and temperature variations. In this paper, four active inductor architectures i.e. basic, resistive feedback, Weng-Kuo and regulated cascode active inductor are designed. The quality factor performance of the four active inductor circuits is evaluated. Further, to demonstrate the performance of active inductors, bandpass filter configurations are implemented. The impact of process, voltage and temperature variations on the quality factor of active inductors and resonant frequency of bandpass filters is studied. Simulations are carried out at 180-nm technology node. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",,"Bandpass filters; CMOS integrated circuits; Natural frequencies; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Cmos active inductors; Communication circuits; Process , voltage and temperatures; Process Technologies; Resistive feedback; Self resonant frequency; Temperature variation; Tunable inductance; Electric inductors","Kumar, V.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, India; email: vikashkr@bitmesra.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",09467076,,,,"English","Microsyst Technol",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039694765

Out of these ECG is one of the important bioelectric signals for our concern and for investigation of various heart ailments. ECG demonstrates graphical rendition of activity of the heart and by analyzing the ECG signal several heart diseases can be identified. For analysis of ECG signal, it must be noise free. There are several techniques for filtering out the noise from ECG signal. It is imperative to find out a best possible method for ECG Signal de-noising, which may be investigated by finding and comparing the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratios (SSNR) and root-mean-square deviations (RMSD). By considering a mother wavelet with different levels and threshold, the values of SSNR and RMSD are calculated and compared to achieve a best possible result. Similarly, by utilizing different frame lengths and polynomial orders, the S-G filter is employed to find SSNR and RMSD. The results of these methods are also compared.

In such a scenario, Free Space Optics (FSO) is seen as an effective alternative to cater the future bandwidth demands. However, commercial deployment of the technology is hampered owing to the various atmospheric phenomenon that severely limits the link quality of service. Among all the weather conditions, fog causes the maximum attenuation reaching hundreds of decibels per kilometer which results in high data rate drops and frequent link outages. Further, because of detrimental laser hazards in the wavelength band of interest, one cannot increase the laser power beyond a certain limit to improve the system performance. This work analyses NRZ-OOK FSO system under continental foggy conditions keeping in view of laser eye safety limits. Various system parameters such as transmission data rate, beam divergence and avalanche photodiode gain are analyzed. The challenge to operate at lower wavelengths of near infrared band has been discussed. Based on the investigation carried out, the paper is concluded with an optimal parameter selection. © 2017 IEEE.","attenuation; beam divergence; data rate; eye safety; fog; free space optics (FSO); Q factor; received power; transmitted power","Amplitude shift keying; Bandwidth; Fog; Infrared devices; Optical communication; Optical links; Q factor measurement; Quality of service; Safety factor; Space optics; attenuation; Beam divergence; Data rates; Eye safety; Free space optics; Q-factors; Received power; Transmitted power; Laser safety",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Two well-known flux models of induction motor are used for estimation of rotor flux and speed. The uncertainties in measurement and model are accounted for. The experiment is carried out on a closed loop field-oriented control system. An estimate of the state variables in the next instant is made, using the conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF). This estimate is used to smoothen the estimate of the previous instant. This refinement is found to improve the estimates of the previous and next instances, since an additional data point is made use of. Using the measured stator phase voltages and currents, speed is estimated. The results are compared with those with the Extended Kalman Filter. The algorithm is found to make improvement in the transient part of response of the system, for the same values of process and measurement error covariances. The performance of the system for different reference speeds is also analyzed. It is observed that the transient performance is improved and estimation remains good for a range of values of process and measurement error covariances. © 2017 IEEE.","Extended Kalman Filter; Induction Motor; SensorlessControl; Single-Stage Smoothing","AC motors; Bandpass filters; Extended Kalman filters; Kalman filters; Measurement errors; Sensorless control; Speed; Uncertainty analysis; Vector control (Electric machinery); Additional datum; Single stage; Smoothing filters; Speed estimation; Speed-sensor less; Three phase induction motor; Transient parts; Transient performance; Induction motors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044239132

It thus strengthens our present day Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by quickly classifying the attack. Datasets like KDD-CUP 99, Kyoto 2006+, iCTF, DEFCON, NSL-KDD are available for experiments. However, most of them are not license-free and some are unlabeled. Here we have carried out the experiments on KDD-CUP 99 dataset. The major contribution of the paper is to determine the most appropriate feature selection algorithm to select the relevant features from 41 attributes of the connection vector. We have used statistical techniques to classify the instances of KDD-CUP 99. The results are analysed for various models by comparing their accuracy, detection rate, FAR etc. Empirical evaluation validates the superiority of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Anomaly Intrusion Detection; Feature Selection; KDD-CUP 99","Bandpass filters; Computer crime; Feature extraction; Mercury (metal); Network security; Anomaly intrusion detection; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Empirical evaluations; Feature selection algorithm; Intrusion Detection Systems; KDD-CUP 99; State-of-the-art methods; Statistical techniques; Intrusion detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044202568

The proposed HIS consists of periodically arranged 6×6 nested concentric square patches on the top layer of the substrate to produce two in-phase reflection bands. The bottom layer is printed with periodic square patches to achieve miniaturization. The antenna comprises of a square patch radiator with four T-shaped slits around the edges and a narrow diagonal slot at the center. The antenna element is placed at a height of 0.8 mm over the HIS and two simultaneous operating modes of the metasurface are studied. By using the HIS in its inductive region as a reactive impedance surface (RIS), significant reduction in the resonant frequencies up to 32.86% and 20.27% are observed in the lower and upper operating bands of the antenna, respectively. When used in HIS mode, the front-to-back ratio in the mid-frequency band of the antenna is greater than 20 dB and the broadside gain is 3.96 dBi. The antenna radiates CP waves in all the three bands with stable radiation patterns and the overlapped impedance and axial ratio bandwidths are 7.69% (2.02-2.18 GHz), 3.17% (4.35-4.49 GHz) and 1.2% (8.32-8.42 GHz), respectively.

At incipient stage of fault, supremacy of healthy components is a major issue in current based monitoring. To overcome this problem, it is essential to suppress the effect of healthy components to estimate the embryonic fault component in stator current. Therefore, in this paper Frequency Spectral Subtraction (FSS) is carried out to remove the above said healthy components to highlight bearing fault component in stator current. FSS is carried out by two ways: one way is frequency components of both healthy and fault components are obtained using FFT and are subtracted directly. On the other hand, the healthy components are predicted using an adaptive filter and are removed in a real time fashion.

Quaternion theory is used for expressing the color difference between two pixels. It considers both the intensity and chromaticity differences. The proposed algorithm is a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, an impulse noise detector is developed to discriminate the color pixels which are likely corrupted by noise. The image is enhanced in the second stage by replacing the noisy pixels with the output of the commonly used vector median filter computed in quaternion form. The obtained results show that the proposed filter achieves good filtering performance over other existing filters. It integrates the advantages of quaternion expression of color images which preserve vector nature by treating it as single entity and robust impulse detection by MAD. © 2017 IEEE.","impulse noise; MAD; quaternion; vector median","Bandpass filters; Color; Colorimetry; Image denoising; Image enhancement; Median filters; Pixels; Vectors; Absolute deviations; Filtering performance; Impulse noise detectors; Impulse noise removals; quaternion; Switching vector median filters; Vector median; Vector median filters; Impulse noise",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044219445

The main focus in this work is to remove the noises that interfere with the ECG signal. For this purpose, a Hamming window FIR filter is used for the removal of Power line and base line drift noises. Firstly, Noise detection is done using the bit error rate measurement (In bit error rate measurement, two signals of the same type are used, out of which one is containing noisy signal and other is a filtered signal. The value of bit error rate lies between 0 and 1; if value is more close to 1 then presence of noise is maximum). After that Noise filtering is the next step. In filtering of the ECG signal, we have used one band stop filter and one low pass filter. These filters are used to remove 60 Hz power line and 0.5 Hz baseline wander noises. Data has been taken from the MIT/BIH arrhythmias database for the performance analysis of the present design. For the detection of the ECG signal, data is first converted into 16 bit input logical data. Co-simulation technique is used to simulate the Hardware Description Language (HDL) module with Modelsim software in real time systems. Final step of the present work is the QRS detection. A new method is used to detect the QRS wave which includes the heart rate calculation and R-R time interval. Several analyses performed for the detection of ECG signal verify that Co-simulation is a suitable method to check the HDL module for real time systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Biorthogonal 2.2 wavelet; Implantable cardiac pacemaker (ICP); MATLAB; VHDL; Wavelet based ECG detector; Xilinx","Bandpass filters; Bit error rate; Computer hardware description languages; Computer simulation languages; Digital signal processing; Electrocardiography; Errors; FIR filters; Interactive computer systems; Low pass filters; MATLAB; Notch filters; Pacemakers; Real time systems; Signal detection; Biorthogonal; Bit error rate measurements; Digital signal processing techniques (DSP); Hardware description languages (HDL); Heart rate calculation; Implantable cardiac pacemakers; Performance analysis; Xilinx; Biomedical signal processing",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Visual video tracking includes object detection and tracking which are closely related process. Object detection involves verifying the presence of object and object tracking is monitoring object's spatial and temporal changes in images sequences. A major challenge in object tracking is the occlusion of the target object by other objects in the scene. In this paper we have proposed an automatic object tracking system to track occluded and Non-occluded object in the videos using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and Kalman filter. The objects in the image sequences can be identified with the help of invariant features extracted using SIFT algorithm. SIFT algorithm exhibits poor performance in the event of occlusion. However the occluded objects can be tracked using Kalman filter since Kalman filter optimally estimates the position of the object in the current frame using the information obtained from the previous frame. The performance of our method is evaluated using videos captured using webcam, downloaded videos from the web and some videos from visual tracker Benchmark dataset and we have achieved better recall and precision for the proposed tracking system than SIFT based tracking system. © 2017 IEEE.","Kalman filter; Object tracking; Occlusion; SIFT","Bandpass filters; Benchmarking; Image processing; Kalman filters; Object detection; Tracking (position); Object detection and tracking; Object Tracking; Occlusion; Recall and precision; Scale invariant feature transforms; SIFT; Spatial and temporal changes; Visual object tracking; Object recognition",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044203102

The synchronization speed and precision of the signals depend on the technical implementation of the phase-looked loop (PLL) system. This technology decides the quality of grid utility power to be delivered and consumed. The disturbance rejection capability of the (PLL)s can be improved by implementing different filtering techniques. Synchronous reference frame phase locked loop (SRF-PLL) is the most commonly used synchronisation technique because of its simple operation good dynamic response. The conventional (SRF-PLL) controller with high bandwidth is preferable in case of balanced and undistorted grid voltage signals, however fails to work properly in case of distorted and polluted grid conditions. So the estimated signals can have a substantial amount of unnecessary ripple. The detection system bandwidth can be reduced to attenuate the effect of harmonics on the output in case of balanced but polluted grid voltage with higher order harmonics of reasonable amplitude. In this paper a robust second order adaptive filters (SOAF) is used to extract the harmonic components existing in a balanced and polluted harmonic grid signal. This filter tracks properly even if the fundamental harmonic frequency as well as the magnitude of the grid voltage abruptly varies. © 2017 IEEE.","band pass filter; disturbance rejection capability; notch filter; phase jump; phase locked loops; Robust second order adaptive filters; synchronous reference frame phase locked loop; Transient Response","Adaptive filtering; Bandpass filters; Bandwidth; Disturbance rejection; Electric power transmission networks; Harmonic analysis; Locks (fasteners); Notch filters; Phase locked loops; Synchronization; Transient analysis; Distributed power generation systems; Higher order harmonics; Phase jumps; Power electronics systems; Power quality improvement; Second orders; Synchronous reference frame; Technical implementation; Adaptive filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

A trade off is maintained between the bandwidth and the Gain of the Antenna to get rid of the problem of Non Line Of Sight communication in the UWB frequency range.

However, the additional irradiance in the blue regions is found to be complementary of the absorption spectrum peaks of human blood. Here, we have utilized such spectral characteristics of a typical white LED light as a source of white light interferometry for the measurement of thickness of blood film, additional irradiance of the LED spectrum is supposed to take care the imaginary component of refractive index of human blood. The thickness of blood duly measured by our developed technique is found to be essentially dictated by mean diameter of red blood cells as depicted by dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies on the corresponding blood samples. This technique can also follow the changes of the red blood cells diameter in isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic solutions consistent with DLS studies on corresponding blood samples. Even quantitative agreement of the measured thickness of the blood film with the values obtained from DLS studies can be made on taking the surface roughness of the glass substrates (cover slips) as measured from Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM).

A recently developed technique known as compressive sensing provides a solution for using the bandwidth effectively by transmitting the samples of a compressed analog signal. For compressive sampling, the analog has to be converted into sparse, for which an apt transform must be used. Next, the analog must be sampled using a basis function. This paper proposes a novel analog to information converter where a cascaded transform is used to convert the image signal into sparse and where the sparse signal is compressed using a Gaussian random matrix.

This implements an evolved node base station (eNB). The Integrated eNB's in 4G network are responsible for seamless switching between different technologies and channels. Such a switching decision is often affected by several parameters like available bandwidth, desired load, inter channel interference, available signal to noise ratio, fading, downlink power and so on. Regular switching between channels result in waste of a portion of bandwidth in control signal whereas delayed switching results in low packet delivery ratio and in turn low data rate. Hence, an optimal solution is desired to maintain high data rate under scalable 4G network. In this work, we propose an optimal resource allocation and power allocation using a Feed Forward Neural Network based machine learning framework for channel condition classification. The system is trained with probe packets under controlled conditions. The eNB nodes then manage the channel resources based on resource constraints during communication of performance parameters. Results shows that the proposed system improves effective data rate and packet delivery ratio in comparison with conventional linear techniques. © 2017 IEEE.","eNB; LTE; Neural network and resource allocation","4G mobile communication systems; Bandwidth; Heterogeneous networks; Learning systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Queueing networks; Resource allocation; Satellite communication systems; Signal to noise ratio; Switching; Controlled conditions; Interchannel interference; Long term evolution networks; LTE heterogeneous networks; Optimal resource allocation; Packet delivery ratio; Performance parameters; Resource allocation schemes; Wireless telecommunication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

According to the reports, annual data center traffic is growing at a very high growth rate of 25%, of which the major contribution is due to the servers within the data centers, i.e. Intra datacenters. The traffic outside the data center is handled by high-speed optical fiber network. However, within the datacenter the data is handled by both optical and electrical interconnects. It is essential that the fully network infrastructure is made optical to cater to the future needs. To fulfill the intra- and inter-system bandwidth requirements of data centers and HPC (high-performance computers). Though the server racks are connected through active optical cables, the server boards are still fully electrical, i.e. the optical-electrical conversion is done at the board edge. This conversion leads to bandwidth limitations at the server board. In this work we proposed to extend the optical reach to the processing unit i.e., microprocessors and memory unit from board edge. This is achieved by designing an OEPCB (Optical-Electrical Printed Circuit Board) using laser direct writing and to define high-speed optical waveguide. In this work, we target to demonstrate an on-board waveguide technology that can support data rate of 10 Gbps/channel. The demonstrator will enable a platform for further improvement in integration that will enable the next generation High-speed connection in Datacenters. © 2017 IEEE.","Datacenters; direct writing; HPC; inkjet printing; OEPCB; on-board waveguide","Bandwidth; Digital storage; Electric network parameters; Ink jet printing; Microelectronics; Optical cables; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Optical waveguides; Timing circuits; Data centers; Direct writing; Electrical interconnects; High performance computers; High speed connections; Network infrastructure; OEPCB; Polymer optical waveguide; Printed circuit boards",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538617168,,,"English","Int.

Efficient and effective provisioning of resources is very important now-a-days. Due to the increase in number of users, providing sufficient bandwidth has become a difficult task for the service providers and network operators. Researchers have developed many techniques to resolve this issue but they have not reached to full extent. The internet traffic is heavy during the working or office hours and less during nonworking hours. To overcome the above issues, different policies like Policy1 - Traffic Balancing (P1-TB), Policy2 - Traffic Balancing (P2-TB) and Policy3 - Traffic Balancing (P2-TB) have been developed but these schemes have few limitations. To resolve the complications of above, we have proposed an algorithm which considers the data rate, level of employee in an organization. The demand with high data rate (almost equal to the capacity of the wavelength of the fiber) will be processed directly and the demand with the lower data rate will be groomed with the existing low data rate demands. This leads in serving more number of demands. From the results, we monitored that the new protocol outperforms the existing schemes with less blocking probability by serving more number of requests. © 2017 IEEE.","Grooming; P1-TB; P2-TB; P3-TB; PB-TB; RWA; SLD; Static traffic; WDM","Bandwidth; Blocking probability; Microelectronics; Satellite communication systems; Wavelength division multiplexing; Grooming; High bandwidth; Internet traffic; Network operator; Service provider; Static traffic; Traffic balancing; WDM optical networks; Routing protocols",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538617168,,,"English","Int.

In addition, the coverage frequency includes wireless local area networks (WLAN) and WiMax. Significant structural changes are made in one of the latest structure of multiband antenna which is a combination of L-type, C-type and inverted F-type. All of the bands showed the gain of over 2dB and significant S11 parameters of below-10dBm. Additionally, all of them have significant 3-dB bandwidth. The changes in structure further improved bandwidth, gain for some of the bands. With coupled-fed mechanism and a slotted ground structure, we obtain multiband and wideband characteristics. The influences of the modifications introduced into the ground plane as well as structure of all types of antenna, improved the bandwidths significantly.

In past, Identity of a person verified by traditional token-based or knowledge-based system but in recent year's bio-metrics traits like face, finger, iris, palm print etc. become a key technology for identity verification. Palm print is also the one bio-metric trait that can be used for the efficient identification. Palm print contains many unique features like principal lines, points, ridges, textures etc. that can differentiate two person. Because palm is a large area of hand, there is a common problem of palm displacement over scanner that results in increase in false rejection rate. This paper proposed a method which first generates ROI of captured palm image then median filtering is applied to remove noise and increasing edge sharpness. Histogram equalization applied after that for contrast stretching for low resolution images. Enhanced image is then divided in sixteen equal part, texture feature is extracted from each part of image separately using different orientations of Gabor filter. The generated feature vectors of all sixteen images are then normalized to a single feature vector using n bin histogram process. This increase acceptance rate in case if palm is placed over scanner in slightly different angles because working on small areas of palm helps to extract detail features.

The proposed method is based on the wavelet transform and the input speech signal is decomposed into various frequency channels. The purpose of Wavelet transform is to find the frequency spectrum while wavelet cepstral coefficient is used to capture the characteristic of the signal. It is more suitable than Fourier transform because it is restricted in both time and frequency whereas fourier transform is only restricted in frequency.

The designed filter structure is simulated using XILINX ISE 14.7. The designed module is synthesized using CADENCE RTL Compiler and the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design of the proposed filter structure is implemented using CADENCE tool set on CADENCE GPDK45nm technology. By applying Fast FIR Algorithm, 65 percent of multipliers are reduced and the number of adders are increased. The adders occupy less silicon area than multipliers.

With wide area of implementation including military, commercial and education use, MANET also has some shortfalls like frequent topology changes, bandwidth limitation and energy utilization. Because of these shortfalls, many researchers have proposed swarm intelligence based protocols which are more intelligent, robust and adaptive. These routing protocols are inspired from the behavior of natural systems like ant colonies (ACO), bee colonies (BCO), termites, fish schools and many more. These protocols are intelligent enough to adapt better routing than traditional MANET routing protocols.

Browsing with Tor is often slow due to the design where the path taken from client to server is not the shortest path but ensures that it is secure in such a way that user's anonymity is maintained. Due to this, speed and anonymity is inversely proportional in the Tor network. Furthermore, since Tor uses circuits with relays in different geographical locations, it makes the connection further protracted. With so many factors affecting the performance, there is a need to improve on the current functionalities and contribute to low latency, anonymous browsing. In this paper, we try to enhance the speed of the client's browsing by segregating the relays based on their derived bandwidth as given in the consensus file and selecting path for clients based on their requirement. We discard some of the relays which are below the 12.5 percentile of all the valid relays while creating circuits for clients with high bandwidth requirement. Based on the simulations that we ran on Shadow Simulator, we have observed that, in our proposed algorithm, we are ensuring that low bandwidth relays are not congested with connection from clients with high bandwidth requirement. This has improved the low bandwidth client speed significantly. In our simulations, we also observe that there is no compromise in anonymity in our proposed algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Path Selection; Relay Segregation; Tor Network","Computer programming; Computer science; Anonymous browsing; Client requirement; Geographical locations; High bandwidth; Path selection; Path selection algorithms; Shortest path; Tor networks; Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

By connecting a capacitor bank will produces harmonics amplification, causes power disturbances in the network, continuous tripping of capacitor and finally failure of the capacitor. This harmonic amplification problem can be overcome by connecting a de-Tuned filter in distribution network. The effect of the harmonic frequency on the fundamental will depends on the value of the detuned filter components such as inductance and capacitance.

It helps for controlling and monitoring of the power system. With the help of it optimal state of the power system can be obtained. It measures the voltage and current phasors and also measure the angles between buses. So estimation of the power system should be more accurate. Power system is highly non-linear so it is not an easy task to forecast the state of the power system with the methods used before. Particle filter is very obvious solution for these type of non-linear system. It gives very accurate results of the estimations of the system.

However, there is an increase in the energy consumption with the increase in the number of clusters for forwarding data. This paper presents an energy-efficient clustering approach for collaborative data forwarding in mobile ad hoc network. The cluster head (CH) is selected based on the processing capability of the nodes and link connection metrics. The CH receives the data from the server and forwards the data to the member nodes at a corresponding data rate of the nodes. Data offloading technique manages the data traffic in the network. The CH rejoining approach enables load balancing in the network. The proposed clustering approach achieves a significant reduction in the energy consumption and data traffic and improvement in the throughput rate through stable routing.

The traditional approach of bandwidth estimation is not accurate as there are many factors like congestion that can delay the arrival rate of the ping packet which may lead to a misconception that the bandwidth was low. Thus, the better approach to this problem will be to estimate the link conditions based on the buffer fullness. In this paper, a new system to support streaming of live and stored video through wireless network is proposed which is based on adaptive playback buffer management on the top of HTTP at the client. The buffer fullness is treated as a direct state variable that reflects the fluctuation of the network bandwidth. The buffer fullness estimation predicts the buffer status at a point in the future based on observations of the buffer over a stipulated period of time. The proposed algorithm uses non-linear exponential non-parametric regression for computing the decision parameter. A feedback message is then sent to the server in order to change the quality of the video stream for smoother video play at the client side. The synchronized update and feedback between the server and clients is achieved using HTTP protocol. During the experimentation with live video streaming, the proposed algorithm shows an improvement of 24.48% in average peak signal-to-noise ratio and 6.63% in average structural similarity index against the buffer underflow probability algorithm. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Buffer analysis; Client-server; PSNR; Regression; SSIM; Video streaming; VQM","Bandwidth; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Image communication systems; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless networks; Adaptation; Buffer analysis; Client server; PSNR; Regression; SSIM; Video streaming","Arun Raj, L.; Department of Information Technology, Anna University, MIT CampusIndia; email: arun4u85mit@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",16875176,,,,"English","Eurasip J.

Modelling of the emotion recognition process serves to understand as well as assess the performance of the system. This paper compares two different models for speech emotion recognition using vocal tract features namely, the first four formants and their respective bandwidths. The first model is based on a decision tree and the second one employs logistic regression. Whereas the decision tree models are based on machine learning, regression models have a strong statistical basis. The logistic regression models and the decision tree models developed in this work for several cases of binary classifications were validated by speech emotion recognition experiments conducted on a Malayalam emotional speech database of 2800 speech files, collected from ten speakers. The models are not only simple, but also meaningful since they indicate the contribution of each predictor. The experimental results indicate that speech emotion recognition using formants and bandwidths was better modelled using decision trees, which gave higher emotion recognition accuracies compared to logistic regression.

Automated cache template attacks, in particular, are very powerful as the vulnerabilities do not need to be manually identified. Such attacks can be devised using both the Prime+Probe and the Flush+Reload techniques. In this paper, we present PokerFace, a novel method to identify and mitigate such attacks. This approach allows us to identify suspicious cache accesses automatically, without prior knowledge about the system or access to hardware metrics. PokerFace consists of two components, Poker and Face. Poker executes a memory bus benchmark to measure the available bus bandwidth and derive information about cache accesses and possible side channel attacks. Our experiments with cache attacks show a reduction of up to 14% in the memory bandwidth during the attack. When an attack is detected, Poker triggers Face which performs cache obfuscation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against keypress logging attacks. We also test it against generic Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload attacks and show that it is practically useful against a variety of cache timing attacks. PokerFace incurs modest overheads (< 8%) and moreover, does not require support from the cloud provider or changes to the hypervisor. Unlike previously proposed techniques, it can be implemented by cloud subscribers. © 2017, The Author(s).","Cache obfuscation; Cloud security; Side channel attacks","Bandwidth; Buses; Cache memory; Probes; System buses; Cache obfuscation; Cache timing attacks; Cloud providers; Cloud securities; Last-level caches; Memory bandwidths; Prior knowledge; Template Attacks; Side channel attack","Raj, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: arun@cse.iitm.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",2192113X,,,,"English","J.

A cantilever based piezoelectric energy harvester acts as a spring mass damper system having a resonance frequency tuned with ambient vibrations of low frequency. Maximum potential is generated when the resonance frequency of the energy harvester matches with frequency of ambient vibration. The highlight of this paper is a pyramidal shape seismic mass which results in a higher generated potential as compared to the square shaped seismic mass. This pyramidal shape is realized using tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide CMOS compatible 25 wt% wet etching. Two beam and four beam structures are front released using deep reactive ion etching which are fixed from both ends and having pyramidal shape seismic mass at the center. This paper presents a comparison of guided four beam and two beam cantilever type piezoelectric energy harvester fabricated using MEMS technology using a laser doppler vibrometer (LDV). Experimentally using LDV the resonance frequency for the fabricated guided two beam cantilever structure resonance frequency is 1971.9 Hz and for the guided four beam cantilever structure is 2540.6 Hz.

An ensemble hybrid algorithm is developed by using artificial neural networks and bacterial foraging optimization algorithm technique for designing a fractal antenna of a rectenna system working at 2.45 GHz. The closed form expressions are not available for the fractal antennas, so the use of artificial intelligence techniques for their design is appropriate. As the size reduction in rectenna systems used in wireless devices is a significant research domain to meet the demand for reduced size handheld devices, so the geometry of the antenna is selected to achieve this objective and a size reduction of 34.39 % is attained.

In the first stage of the proposed technique, we follow an absolute directional difference of the neighborhood pixels to identify the pixels those are affected by impulse noise. We propose an edge preserving contextual model to restore the noisy pixels. The noise correction stage of the proposed scheme depends on the context model of the noise-free pixels in the selected window. The parameters of the contextual model are obtained using a Gaussian kernel. The proposed algorithm is tested on nine benchmark test images.

In this approach, a Berkeley short-channel4 metal oxide field effect transistor (BSIM4, MOSFET) device is loaded in rectangular slotted patch antenna which results in wide band frequency of operation. To understand the design and analysis of low noise amplifier, an equivalent circuit model is extracted from the rectangular slotted patch antenna using finite element method (FEM) simulator where the slotted effect is considered. An extraction of equivalent model from the slotted patch antenna results in the L–C circuit which is used to perform an impedance transformation for low noise amplifier. A 12 GHz low noise amplifier using L–C circuit can improve performance parameters as per designer’s requirement. A reconfigurable MOS loaded slotted patch antenna is verified using momentum microwave simulator and a wide bandwidth of 9 GHz in the frequency range of 10.3–19.3 GHz is achieved. The Low noise amplifier is simulated with TSMC 0.09 µm mixed signal/RF CMOS process technology.

As the HOM act as residue, the proposed method results in an improved filtering accuracy. Further, the proposition is extended in delayed measurement environment.

In these networks, each frame is divided into various zones to facilitate data transmission between various types of nodes. As the link qualities in the network change, accordingly the zone sizes should also change to support the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of flows and to avoid bandwidth wastage. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an adaptive zone size selection method for IEEE 802.16j networks. With this method, zone sizes of scheduling nodes are adaptively changed in accordance with their changing link qualities. As the link qualities degrade, the scheduling nodes may not be able to support the QoS requirements of flows due to the lack of free bandwidth availability in the corresponding zones. To handle this issue with less control overhead, we propose a cross-zone bandwidth allocation method. A zone size reselection method is also proposed to handle the situations where the cross-zone bandwidth allocation is not possible. Performance of the proposed method is compared with the performance of a fixed zone size selection method and a zone size selection method proposed in the literature. The proposed method shows significantly better performance than the other two methods in terms of traffic admittance, bandwidth utilization, and satisfaction ratios of flows. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adaptive zone size selection; IEEE 802.16j mobile multihop relay networks; Link quality; Quality of service","Bandwidth; Ion beams; Relay control systems; Scheduling; Band-width utilization; Bandwidth availability; Control overhead; Ieee 802.16 networks; Link quality; Mobile multi-hop relays; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Size selection; Quality of service","Rajya Lakshmi, L.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology DelhiIndia; email: rajya99@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027704238

Images accomodate various types of noises which are due to sensor defects, lens distortion, software artifacts, blur etc. Denoising an image not only aims at removing the undesired noise but also, at retaining the features of the original image. The same goes for hyperspectral images which have numerous bands (each band contains information of the same object or location taken under different wavelengths of light) as compared to the red, green and blue bands of a color image. The need for better denoising techniques have brought about the birth of different image denoising algorithms, each with its own unique characteristics. Total Variation Denoising (TVD) is an advent for noise removal developed so as to retain sharp edges in the underlying signal. It is characterised as an optimization problem. Denoising using Legendre-Fenchel transform also widely used. Least Square based denoising technique is computationally demanding and gives better results. This paper compares the efficiency of various image denoising techniques like, total variation denoising, legendre-fenchel transform and wavelet transform denoising with the proposed method of least square denoising.

Utilization of the available resources becomes troublesome due to rise in the number of users. So it is important to provide the resources efficiently. To solve the problem of resource provisioning, many developments have been made by the researchers. During working hours, the scheduled traffic is huge and sluggish during rest of the time which leads to the blocking of requests during working hours. To overcome the above issues, different schemes like Earliest set-up demand first (ESDF) and Earliest tear-down demand first (ETDF) have been developed. These schemes have few limitations like consumption of resources in ESDF and more delay in ETDF process. To resolve the complications of the existing policies, we proposed Power Efficient-Resource Utilization protocol (PE-RUP) wherein the capacity of the wavelength and the data rate of each demand will be considered. The demand with high data rate (almost equal to the capacity of the wavelength of the fiber) will be processed directly and the demand with the lower data rate will be groomed with the existing low data rate demands. This leads in serving more number of demands. From the results, we monitored that the new protocol outperforms the existing schemes with Resource utilization ratio (RUR), number of requests served and proper usage of bandwidth. Here we also focus on the power consumption of the network by selecting the route based on the cost of the link. © 2017 IEEE.","ESDF; ETDF; Grooming; PE-RUP; RWA; Set-up time; SLD; Static traffic; Tear-down time; WDM","Satellite communication systems; Wavelength division multiplexing; Down time; ESDF; ETDF; Grooming; Set-up time; Static traffic; Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, a new filter is proposed which removes mixed noise such as Gaussian and impulse noise. Initially, pixels of image are separated into non-corrupted pixels and corrupted pixels based on existence of noises in their small neighborhood. The greyscale value of noncorrupted pixels are taken as output directly and for the corrupted pixels, removing Gaussian noises and impulse noises respectively is done based on their characteristics.

However, degraded iris images captured under less constrained acquisition setups and varying lighting conditions will affect the performance of iris based biometrics systems. This paper presents a novel method for iris recognition through symbolic modeling approach and also investigates the applicability of Savitzky-Golay filter for iris feature extraction. The approach also proves that the symbolic representation effectively handles noise and degradations, including low resolution, specular reflection, and occlusion of eyelids present in the eye images and uses minimum number of features to represent iris image. Hence reduction in the number of features for iris representation will decrease testing times during classification. The modified content based symbolic similarity analysis method is devised and used to compare the symbolic object of test image and symbolic knowledge base of trained eye images.

The algorithm developed has been tested in a 4L active shunt filter (ASF) which helped to reduce harmonics from source currents of a three phase 4W LT distribution system having non-linear and unbalanced load. The ASF also reduces the unwanted component of neutral current. All unwanted components of line currents and the neutral current have been used to generate the 3D reference signal vector to modulate the ASF. Neutral current has been divided in two components, the undesirable and the normal, acknowledging the unbalanced nature of 4W LT distribution systems as a normal phenomenon. The proposed ASF has a unique feature that its bridge circuit capacitor has no need of prior charging to a voltage and to maintain that constant during operations. The MATLAB/simulation of the proposed ASF, working with the developed program, has become simpler in design without phase locked loop or feedback loop and has satisfactory performance. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","3D SVPWM; ?-?-? frame; Four leg active shunt filter; Four leg converters; Space vector; Switching state vector","Bandpass filters; Bridge circuits; MATLAB; Passive filters; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Vectors; Voltage control; 3D SVPWM; ?-?-? frame; Active shunt filters; Four-leg converter; Space Vector; State vector; Active filters",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353243,,,"English","ACM Int.

The interest in Kalman filter is motivated by the wide variety of applications it provide. The Kalman filter is an iterative filter which considers a series of measurements (that contains statistical noise) over time, and then estimates the unknown variable. The primary concern is to design a block in GNU Radio for the operation of Kalman filtering. In this work, a block has been created and we explored the filtering algorithm using three different key in mechanisms - 1)a continuous signal dataset, 2)an open flight tracker dataset, 3)a generated dataset. The first mechanism include providing a continuous sinusoidal signal source to the filter block. Then, an open aircraft dataset used in tracking the position of flight was considered and had been fed to experiment the Kalman filter block. Further, a dataset generated by considering the practical possibilities of a giant moving object was input to the block. The result of all the three mechanisms confirm that there is an effective noise reduction in position tracking, on using Kalman filtering algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","continuous sinusoidal signal; GNU Radio; Kalman filters; statistical noise","Aircraft detection; Bandpass filters; Iterative methods; Open source software; Signal filtering and prediction; Filtering algorithm; GNU radio; Kalman filtering algorithms; Kalman-filtering; Moving objects; Sinusoidal signals; Statistical noise; Kalman filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467388542,,,"English","Int.

To mitigate the effects of the harmonics, it is advisable to eliminate them or to maintain them within the statutory limits. This objective can be effectively achieved using Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF). However, it is a challenging task to control the SAPF to effectively compensate the harmonics, especially when the grid voltage is characterized by different abnormalities like presence of harmonics, imbalance in supply, imbalance in load, dc offset etc. The SAPF's effectiveness depends on the accurate generation of the reference current. Some of the conventional methods fail to generate the desired reference current under some of these grid abnormalities, ultimately leading to deviation from a balanced set of sinusoidal grid currents. The paper presents the technique to compute the reference compensating current using second-order generalized integrator (SOGI), frequency-locked loop (FLL) and instantaneous power theory (p-q theory) to control SAPF. This approach, which obtains the reference current from the voltage and current components derived through dual SOGI-FLL, can effectively and quickly compensate the harmonics even under unbalance conditions. The system's dynamic performance is tested for a three-phase three-wire network under different grid abnormalities and the results are reported and analyzed. © 2017 IEEE.","Active power filter; phase-locked loop; second-order generalized integrator","Bandpass filters; Harmonic analysis; Locks (fasteners); Phase locked loops; Power control; Active power Filter; Distributed generators; Frequency locked loops; Instantaneous power theory; Second-order generalized integrators; Secondorder generalized integrator (SOGI); Shunt active power filter (SAPF); Shunt active power filters; Active filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

Proposed configuration reduces total harmonic distortion (THD) of supply current with the injection of LC resonant filter at the supply end. By the analysis of dominant side band components of the supply current, the resonant LC filter is chosen. The cutoff frequency of filter transfer function is estimated through the bode plot. However, at a low output frequency (less than 1kHz), the filter is only able to reject higher order components, but lower order harmonics mainly 3rd &amp; 5'h order components still exist in the input current. This demands a closed loop control technique for removing lower as well as higher order component simultaneously. Closed loop control of SPMC shapes the input current in sinusoidal nature at a low output frequency less than 1kHz. But the spikes arise in higher output frequency and affects the switching stress. To avoid the spikes and make the active current shaping purely sinusoidal at any output frequency, LC filter is inserted at the supply end. The proper switching technique to eliminate the commutation problem is explained in details. The simulation results of this topology are verified by using MATLAB/SIMULINK. © 2017 IEEE.","bidirectional switches; closed loop technique; PI controller; resonant filter; single phase matrix converter (SPMC); sinusoidal pulse width modulation(SPWM); total harmonic distortion(THD)","Bandpass filters; Bode diagrams; Closed loop control systems; Cutoff frequency; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic distortion; Induction heating; MATLAB; Matrix converters; Modulation; Power converters; Topology; Voltage control; Wave filters; Bidirectional switch; Closed loops; PI Controller; Resonant filter; Single phase matrix converter; Sinusoidal pulse width modulation; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Passive filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

Since the network bandwidth is always limited, we require efficient compression algorithms to facilitate fast and efficient sharing of data over the network. In this paper, we discuss algorithms of widely used traditional and modern compression techniques. In an effort to find the optimum compression algorithm, we compare commonly used modern compression algorithms: Deflate, Bzip2, LZMA, PPMd and PPMonstr by analyzing their performance on Silesia corpus. The corpus comprises of files of varied type and sizes, which accurately simulates the vast diversity of files shared over the internet. We compare these algorithms on the basis of their compression ratio, compression speed and decompression speed. After observing the simulated results, we found that PPMonstr provides the best compression ratio. Deflate is the fastest algorithm in terms of compression and decompression speed, but provides low compression ratio. Bzip2 and PPMd provide moderate compression speed and good compression ratio and hence are well suited for applications dependent on both compression ratio and speed. Further, experimental results indicate that LZMA is an ideal algorithm for applications requiring high compression ratio along with fast decompression speed as it provides moderate decompression speed coupled with high compression ratio. © 2017 IEEE.","compression; compression ratio; compression speed; decompression speed; lossless compression; network bandwidth; Silesia corpus","Bandwidth; Boron compounds; Compaction; Compression ratio (machinery); Phosphorus compounds; Speed; Comparison and analysis; Compression algorithms; Compression speed; Compression techniques; Lossless compression; Lossless compression techniques; Network bandwidth; Silesia corpus; Bandwidth compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

Channel parameters such as path loss magnitude, rms delay spread, received signal amplitude and multipath have been analyzed from the measured data. Results and analyses highlight the variation of the channel parameters when the glass is rotated at different angles ranging from 0 to 90 degrees mimicking the movement of a door or window present in an indoor environment. Measurement data is also used in predicting different LOS, partial NLOS and NLOS situations which are dependent on the rotation angle of the glass sheet and also the position of the Tx-Rx antennas. Results indicate higher multipath and rms delay spread for edge scattering in comparison to direct through glass propagation. Path loss magnitude varies by 2 to 4 dB for NLOS scenarios in comparison to LOS scenarios. RMS delay spread values increase by 3 to 5 nsec for NLOS scenarios and multipath components by 10 to 15.

It also created new challenges to handle resource allocation and power optimization of User Equipment (UE). The paper explores radio resource allocation and power consumption problem of UE in LTE environment. An intelligent scheduling scheme developed is based on Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) method and AHP-TOPSIS method. It distributes resources in a fair way among a number of applications and UE are prioritized based on certain criteria like delay, throughput history, UE buffer space and channel conditions and preferences. In LTE, Discontinuous Reception (DRX) has been adopted to conserve the battery life of UE. DRX periodically switches off the radio interfaces to conserve the battery life but it may breach Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, the DRX parameters need to be further optimized to satisfy QoS and minimize power consumption of UE. DRX parameters are dynamically adjusted on the basis of current load and channel condition of the network. Power saving operations are numerically analyzed. Simulation results show that the expert and an intelligent system can distribute resources in a fair way among UE, improves the battery consumption of UE up to 85% and packets transmission delay by 10% as compared to existing scheme for real-time applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AHP-TOPSIS method; Cooperative Game Theory; DRX; LTE; Scheduling","4G mobile communication systems; Analytic hierarchy process; Bandwidth; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Hierarchical systems; Intelligent systems; Internet telephony; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Next generation networks; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Standards; Video streaming; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Battery consumption; Cooperative game theory; Discontinuous receptions; Intelligent scheduling; Multimedia applications; Radio resource allocation; Real-time application; TOPSIS method; Game theory","Goyal, T.; Computer Science and Enigneering, UIET, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: tanugoyal27@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020005624

In this regard, the demand of high throughput introduces high throughput standards such as IEEE 802.11ac. It supports Dynamic Bandwidth Channel Access (DBCA), where a wireless station selects channel bandwidth dynamically based on the availability of the secondary channels. But the widely-used contention based medium access mechanism provides an opportunistic access of secondary channels and affects the performance of DBCA. Consequently, unfairness in channel access is increased in DBCA, which further reduces average throughput of stations. In this paper, we develop a hybrid adaptive resource reservation mechanism, Hybrid Adaptive DBCA (HA-DBCA), for supporting fair channel access in DBCA. In HA-DBCA, a polling based online learning mechanism is designed to avoid starvation of primary channel users. Through IEEE 802.11ac testbed implementation, we show that HA-DBCA improves throughput fairness in DBCA significantly along with other performance parameters. © 2017 IEEE.","dynamic bandwidth channel access; fairness; IEEE 802.11ac; multi-armed bandit","Bandwidth; Computer networks; Dynamics; Standards; Adaptive resource reservation; Dynamic bandwidth; fairness; IEEE 802.11 standards; IEEE 802.11ac; Multi armed bandit; Opportunistic access; Performance parameters; Throughput",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781509065226,,,"English","Proc.

However, the high Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) sampling rate required to process wide band signals in the mmWave regime results in significant power consumption in the receiver hardware. In this work, an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based subsampling architecture is proposed to achieve power efficient receiver design. Subbanding in association with orthogonal spreading codes using subsampling technique reduces the high sampling rate requirement of the receiver. Power consumption in the receiver is further reduced by utilizing low resolution ADC with minimal degradation in Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. In addition to this, OFDM transmission with reduced number of Fast Fourier transform (FFT) points alleviates the multi-path effects significantly, and improves the spectral efficiency. The combined effect of ADC bit resolution and subsampling on the system error performance and power consumption is studied. © 2017 IEEE.","60 GHz; ADC; MmWave Communication; OFDM; Subband; Subsampling","Analog to digital conversion; Bandwidth; Electric power utilization; Fast Fourier transforms; Millimeter waves; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Signal receivers; 60 GHz; Analog to digital converters; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Mm-wave Communications; Orthogonal spreading codes; Subbands; Subsampling; Bit error rate",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15502252,9781509059324,IVTCD,,"English","IEEE Veh Technol Conf",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040541236

It is analyzed that the cavity reflector provides an additional CP mode which is merged with the reference CP mode of crossed dipole to get a bandwidth enhancement in the CP operation. The concentration of electric field vectors on the inner walls of cavity provides an enhanced and stable gain of a CP crossed dipole across the entire CP operating bandwidth as compared to a PEC reflector backed crossed dipole antenna.

In this treatise, we present the performance evaluation physical layer design for multi-carrier code-division-multiple-access (MC-CDMA) system for cognitive radio network (CRN) employing link adaptive multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO). CRN in conjunction with MIMO promises to achieve massive amelioration in system bandwidth. We consider link adaption scheme (LAS) which will select modulation scheme and MIMO profile based on channel parameters. CRN is a device in wireless communication which can sense the idle unused spectrum and allocate the spectrum dynamically to base station. We utilize sub-band frequency of CRN for multi-carrier communication and to extract for user-specific spreader in CDMA system. Further, we realize iterative decoder at the receiver to achieve better error-rate performance for CRN based MIMO MC-CDMA system with less signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore,We study the performance of adaptive MIMO scheme with CRN defined MC-CDMA for Stanford University Interim channel model specifications.

We allow for imperfect communication links, where information packets may be lost due to noise and collisions. The packets that are received correctly are used to estimate the objects' trajectories by employing an extended Kalman Filter, where provisions are made to accommodate a randomly changing number of obseravtions in each iteration. An adaptive rate control scheme is additionally applied to instruct the sensor nodes on how to adjust their transmission rate so as to improve the location estimation accuracy and the energy efficiency of the system. By focusing explicitly on the objects' locations, rather than working with a pre-specified grid of potential locations, we resolve the spatial quantization issues associated with sparse identification methods. Finally, we extend the method to address the possibility of objects entering and departing the observation area, thus improving the scalability of the system and relaxing the requirement for accurate knowledge of the objects' initial locations.

In telemedicine application, remote monitoring of critical patients by doctor is a key value in which the real-time data is exchanged via mobile technology. Hence, provision of this sort of real-time bandwidth hungry multimedia critical data seamlessly over mobile networks is a challenging task. In present cellular era, demand towards video-based multimedia services is growing enormously against basic voice services. For instance, the latest smartphones equipped with social networking applications are more popular making voice services obsolete. Hence, allocation of bandwidth efficiently to video, multimedia applications, and selection of optimal cell is a challenging task. In this paper, a novel technique namely continuous cellular statistical measure (CCSM) for optimal cell selection among cell cluster based on cellular statistics such as call blocking ratio (CBR), signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), and inter cell interference (ICI) is introduced especially for telemedicine applications. These parameters are measured and stored in Network Management Entity of the cell cluster. Network management entity is proposed in master base station of a cell cluster. The master base station analyses the statistics of all cells in a cluster periodically. The cells are ranked based on rule-based ranking using analytic hierarchy process. The ranking is communicated to all cells in a cluster for optimal cell selection. Thus, CCSM technique reduces unnecessary handover during transmission of real-time critical data to mobile doctor. So, by analysing cell statistics such as SINR, CBR, and ICI optimal cell among cell cluster is estimated using CCSM technique. © 2017 IETE.","Analytic hierarchy process; Cellular statistics; Continuous cellular statistical measure; Network management entity; QoS","Analytic hierarchy process; Bandwidth; Base stations; mHealth; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia services; Network management; Quality of service; Remote consoles; Remote patient monitoring; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Spurious signal noise; Statistics; Telemedicine; Wireless networks; Call blocking ratios; In-network management; Intercell interference; Multimedia applications; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Social networking applications; Statistical measures; Telemedicine application; Cells",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03772063,,,,"English","IETE J Res",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020696394

However, due to limited bandwidth and high demand of LTE-BWA networks, effective network planning is required to utilize the available radio resources in an efficient way. To achieve this target, this paper aims to implement a unique Radio Resource Management scheme for a heterogeneous LTE based BWA network (BWA Het-Nets) which consists of Small cells along with Macro cells. The proposed analysis has two components: (1) Received Signal Strength (RSS) based CAC policy; and (2) Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) scheme for QoS provisioning. The novelty of this work lies on the integration of the RSS based CAC policy with DBA scheme for improved performance in terms of different QoS parameters like New Call Blocking Probability (NCBP), Hand off Call Dropping Probability (HCDP) and Bandwidth Utilization (BU). A Continuous Time Markov Chain based mathematical model is also developed for the realistic analysis of those QoS parameters.

They depend upon reduced feedback schemes to efficiently feedback channel state information from the users to the base station (BS). In the popular threshold-based quantized feedback scheme, a user feeds back to the BS the quantized value of the signal-to-noise ratio for each subchannel. For this scheme, we derive a novel, throughput-optimal discrete rate adaptation (TORA) policy, which enables a system designer to reduce the feedback overhead. We present it in closed form for different multi-antenna diversity modes for the exponentially correlated subchannel gains model. We also develop a computationally simpler suboptimal variant of it. We derive an insightful lower bound for the fading- and user location-averaged throughput gain achieved by TORA over conventional rate adaptation for 1-bit feedback.

There are many ICI cancellation techniques available in the literature, such as self-cancellation (SC), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and windowing, but they present a tradeoff between bandwidth redundancy and system complexity. In this study, a new energy-efficient, bandwidth-effective technique is proposed to mitigate ICI through cyclic prefix (CP) reuse at the receiver end. Unlike SC and MLE where the whole OFDM symbol data is transmitted in duplicate to create redundancy at the transmitter end, the proposed technique uses the CP data (which is only 20% of the total symbol bandwidth) to estimate the channel, and it produces similar results with a huge bandwidth saving. The simulation results show that the proposed technique has a significant improvement in error performance, and a comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial improvement in energy efficiency with high bandwidth gain. Therefore, it outperforms the legacy ICI cancellation schemes under consideration. © 2017, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cyclic prefix (CP); Fast Fourier transform (FFT); Inter carrier interference (ICI); Inter symbol interference (ISI); Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Bandwidth; Communication channels (information theory); Errors; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency allocation; Frequency estimation; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Redundancy; Comparative analysis; Cyclic Prefix; Frequency offsets; Intercarrier interference; Local oscillator frequencies; Spectrum allocation; Undesirable effects; Wireless mobile communications; Energy efficiency","Sarowa, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: sasarowa@gmail.com",,"Zhejiang University",20959184,,,,"English","Front.

The method uses magnitude spectrum data hiding technique to provide a perceptually better wideband speech signal. The spectral envelope parameters are extracted from the down-sampled frequency shifted version of the high-frequency components of speech signal existing above NB, which are then encoded and spread by using spreading sequences, and are embedded in the low-amplitude high-frequency regions of the magnitude spectrum of NB speech signal. The embedded information is extracted at the receiving end to reconstruct the wideband speech signal.

The antenna is designed and simulated in an electromagnetic field simulation tool. A single element ALTSA is designed first. Then SIW power divider is used for designing 1 × 4 ALTSA array. To validate the proposed design, prototypes have been fabricated and measured. The simulated results agree well with the measured values which validates the proposed design. The measured return loss of single-element ALTSA and 1 × 4 ALTSA array is better than 12 dB over the entire 60 GHz band (57–64 GHz). The measured gain for single-element ALTSA and 1 × 4 ALTSA array is 18.7 ± 0.4 dBi and 22.9 ± 0.6 dBi respectively over the 60 GHz band. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","60 GHz; Antipodal linear tapered slot antenna; Dielectric loading; Millimeter wave; Substrate integrated waveguide","Antenna arrays; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic simulation; Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Slot antennas; Substrate integrated waveguides; Wireless telecommunication systems; Dielectric loadings; Electromagnetic field simulation; High-speed wireless communication; Linear tapered slot antennas; Measured values; Power divider; Simulated results; Single element; Loading","Tiwari, N.; Department of Telecommunication Engineering, SRM UniversityIndia; email: nitizaz@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020745403

Multipliers are the most area and power consuming elements; therefore, it is desirable to realize a filter with minimum number of multipliers. In this paper, design of comb filters based on lattice wave digital filters (LWDF) structure is proposed to minimize the number of multipliers. The fundamental processing unit employed in LWDF requires only one multiplier. These lattice wave digital comb filters (LWDCFs) are realized using Richards' and transformed first-order and second-order all-pass sections. The resulting structural realizations of LWDCFs exhibit properties such as low coefficient sensitivity, high dynamic range, high overflow level, and low round-off noise. Multiplier coefficients of the proposed structures are implemented with canonic signed digit code (CSDC) technique using shift and add operations leading to multiplierless implementation. This contributes in reduction of number of addition levels which reduces the latency of the critical loop. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform is used for evaluation and testing of the proposed LWDCFs to acquire advantages of the parallelism, low cost, and low power consumption. The implementation of the proposed LWDCFs is accomplished on Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 FPGA devices. By means of examples, it is shown that the implementations of the proposed LWDCFs attain high maximum sampling frequency, reduced hardware, and low power dissipation compared with the existing comb filter structures.

In which, unoccupied portion of licensed spectrum would be granted for unlicensed user in order to upgrade the spectrum utilization. Spectrum sensing is an enabling task for labeling the spectrum holes and away from spectrum congestion in cognitive radio networks. Impact of secondary user’s cooperation developed cooperative spectrum sensing for effective spectrum sensing, many secondary users are to be associated in sensing the idle channels. Adversary secondary users (SU) mimic as primary user in cooperative sensing scheme, called primary user emulation attack (PUEA). If any SU forges the sensing data, that is known as spectrum sensing data falsification attack (SSDF). Rescuing the network against these two attacks is the major issue of cognitive radio networks. To address these challenges, we propose cognitive radio network to ensure security in cooperative spectrum sensing for video streaming application. Sensing based clustering algorithm assembles the cognitive radios into clusters to mitigate cooperative overhead and consumed energy. In order to avert PUEA attacks, we introduce authentication signature ID algorithm which provides authority for licensed user to use spectrum. To diminish SSDF attacks, we exploit Hamming algorithm to abolish forgery node from spectrum sensing decision. Furthermore PRN channel allocation algorithm is employed to precisely deliver the video with high quality and lower delay. For video transmission in cognitive radio network, we need to compress the video frames by block truncation coding-pattern fitting in order to reduce bandwidth consumption. This compression technique offers good video transmission with high compression ratio in cognitive radio network, due to trade-off among quality, bit rate and decoding time. Our proposed framework demonstrates the simulation with improved detection rate of idle channel and reduced the delay for high quality video transmission. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Primary user emulation attack; Spectrum sensing; Spectrum sensing data falsification attack; Video streaming","Bandwidth; Clustering algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Crime; Economic and social effects; Image communication systems; Image compression; Pattern matching; Radio; Radio systems; Radio transmission; Video signal processing; Video streaming; Authentication signatures; Channel allocation algorithms; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio technologies; Primary user emulation attack (PUEA); Spectrum sensing; Spectrum sensing data falsification attacks; Video Streaming Applications; Cognitive radio","Duggineni, C.; Department of ECE, GITAM UniversityIndia; email: chaiturohini@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031419650

Our approach does not require any extensive simulations for obtaining the values of design variables like other methods. A unified framework is proposed for designing halfband polynomials with varying vanishing moments. Optimum filter pairs can then be generated by factorization of the halfband polynomial. Although these optimum wavelets have characteristics close to that of CDF 9/7 (Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau), a compact support may not be guaranteed. Subsequently, we show that by proper choice of design parameters finite wordlength wavelet construction can be achieved. These hardware friendly wavelets are analyzed for their possible applications in image compression and feature extraction. Simulation results show that the designed wavelets give better performances as compared to standard wavelets. Moreover, the designed wavelets can be implemented with significantly reduced hardware as compared to the existing wavelets. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Bi-orthogonal wavelet; hardware complexity; image compression","Bandpass filters; Hardware; Image coding; Image compression; Biorthogonal wavelet; Design parameters; Design variables; Extensive simulations; Finite wordlength; Hardware complexity; Unified framework; Wavelet construction; Discrete wavelet transforms",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

The method is based on designing arbitrary shape analysis filter, followed by the design of complementary arbitrary shape synthesis filter. In eigenfilter designing, eigenvector is computed corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of a real, symmetric and positive-definite matrix. In our case, this matrix is formulated using the combination of pass-band and stop-band errors between frequency response of desired and designed arbitrary shape filters. After designing the arbitrary shape analysis filter, same is used in perfect-reconstruction constraint, for the design of complementary arbitrary shape synthesis filter. The length of this arbitrary shape synthesis filter should satisfy certain condition depending on the length of the pre-designed arbitrary shape analysis filter.

However, the mobility of the nodes makes it very difficult to maintain the states of the clusters, such as connectivity between clusters, available bandwidth, and node membership. A good maintenance scheme should balance the workload and power consumption of the nodes, incur little overhead, and track the changes timely and accurately. For this, we consider the implementation of a maintenance sublayer to handle the dynamic state of the clusters. The idea is to hide the dynamics of the underlying clusters, to improve the performance of applications in MANET. In this paper, we examine the design space of the state maintenance problem in cluster-based MANETs. At one end, we study a fully distributed approach, called Cluster-Based WithOut Head Overlay (CWOHO). At the other end, we consider the strategy that uses cluster heads to handle the maintenance operations, called Cluster-Based With Head Overlay (CWHO). In-between two extremes, we investigate a third possibility, called Clusters with Neighbor Information (CNI). We provide an in-depth and comprehensive study of these strategies under various network conditions and mobility models. Our experimental evaluation shows that the data delivery ratio of CWOHO is at least 7% more than CWHO, under increasing node mobility and number of clusters. However, the reverse is true for the control overhead. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Mobile ad hoc network; State maintenance","Ad hoc networks; Bandwidth; Maintenance; Available bandwidth; Clustering; Distributed approaches; Experimental evaluation; Maintenance operations; Maintenance Problem; Maintenance schemes; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Mobile ad hoc networks","Banerjee, A.; Department of Computer Science, South Asian University, New Delhi, India; email: amit@cs.sau.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029913626

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type which satisfies these requirements. But the two main performance parameters of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are near to the ground for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of a patch antenna is 1-2dB. Most straightforward approach of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to generation of surface waves. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antenna with metamaterial on the substrate for multiband application is proposed.

As a result of which communication at higher data rate becomes difficult, moreover it enhances the complexity in receiver design. Researchers working in this area have suggested many techniques to combat the problems asso-ciated with underwater channel. One of the state-of-the-art solutions devised to solve the problems associated with underwater channels is Time Reversal Mirror (TRM) technique. Analysis of TRM based equalizer had been carried out by many re-searchers, but quantification of the effect of TRM is not yet carried out to the best of our knowledge. Knowledge of its value will undoubtedly improvises the quality and data rate of communication. ork reported here provide quantitative analysis of TRM on delay spread and coherence bandwidth over Under Water Acoustic (UWA) channel for Single Input Single Output (SISO) and Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) case. Rsults obtained indicates that TRM improves UWA channel by reducing delay spread and increasing coherence bandwidth and enhances the effective data rate. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Mirrors; Underwater structures; Coherence bandwidth; Multiple input single outputs; Receiver design; Single input single output; State of the art; Time reversal mirrors; Underwater channels; Underwater communication; Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052783,,,"English","OCEANS - Aberdeen",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044657919

Early diagnosis of cancer prevents morbidity and mortality rate. Thermography is an additional tool for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Low contrast, poor Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and complex breast boundaries are the inherent limitation of breast thermal images which makes segmentation a challenging task. In this work, an attempt is made to extract edge map from Type-I and Type-II breast images using Geometric Non linear Diffussion Filter (GNLDF) method to aid accurate segmentation. GNLDF is an iterative nonlinear filter which reduces the noise and preserves the edges based on the local image topology. The extracted edge maps are validated against the input images using betametric and Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD). Result showed that edge map extracted using GNLDF method is distinct for both types of images. The beta metric and GMSD values are found to be 0.29 and 0.004 indicating high resemblance of filtered image edges with the input images. GNLDF method has improved the SNR of Type-I and Type-II images by 35dB compared to Perona Malik method. Hence, the edge map extracted using GNLD filter shall aid accurate segmentation of breast tissue to identify pathology for clinical interpretation and diagnosis. © 2017 IEEE.","Beta metric; Breast thermography; GMSD and SNR; GNLDF; Perona Malik","Bandpass filters; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image processing; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Thermography (imaging); Beta metric; Breast boundary; Geometric non-linear; GMSD and SNR; GNLDF; Gradient magnitude; Inherent limitations; Perona Malik; Image enhancement",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049790,,,"English","Proc.

Fundamental frequency (F0) of the speech signal and local variations around F0 are the characteristics of glottal excitation source. Extraction of this information from the speech spectrum can be used to estimate epochs (since higher harmonics interact with the vocal tract characteristics, they no longer represent the true glottal source). In this paper, we bandpass filter the speech signal through a novel Gaussian filterbank followed by simple peak detection to extract epochs. We do not attempt any post processing to study the effectiveness of F0 on epoch estimation in the proposed method. The algorithm is validated on various databases and compared with four state-of-the-art methods.

Applications generated by the devices are diverse in nature, for each application bandwidth and delay requirements vary. The flows in the network compete for a constrained resource such as bandwidth or low latency path, an intelligent flow routing algorithm becomes a natural demand. Better overall network performance could be achieved only if the network is capable of prioritizing the flows and assign resources based on their application specific requirement. Our proposed, AMPS controller is capable of prioritizing each of the flow using MLT, and assign a path based on its classified priority. AMPS controller supports routing flows through different path even if the flows are between the same pair of nodes. The path finding algorithm employs Yen-K-shortest path algorithm, also it supports scalable flow routing for a large volume of flows. We have implemented the flow routing algorithm in OpenvSwitch as a proof of concept. A significant improvement is observed in comparison to SDN with traditional routing techniques involving a large number of flows. The proposed flow routing algorithm ensures high availability of an unloaded path for high priority flows even in a heavily loaded network. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Learning systems; Network routing; Routers; Application specific requirements; Constrained resources; Controller support; High availability; K-shortest path algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Path-finding algorithms; Routing techniques; Routing algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053568,,,"English","Natl.

In this paper, we aim to increase the bandwidth of a patch antenna, operating in the X band region of frequency. For the said purpose, we initially synthesize a co-ax fed patch antenna for a solution frequency of 9 GHz. By the variation of three distinct parameters, one at a time, viz the patch length, patch width and feed position, we formulate a relationship between the bandwidth of the antenna and each parameter separately, the other two remaining constant. Thereafter, combining the effects of the three variations simultaneously, we propose a cost function to establish the bandwidth in terms of the net varying parameters. Using this equation and a popular optimization algorithm, viz the Cuckoo Search algorithm, we find the combination of the three concerned parameters which can leadus to have a significant increase over the initially measured bandwidth, thereby achieving optimization. © 2017 IEEE.","Cuckoo Search optimization; Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna with Co-ax feed","Antenna feeders; Bandwidth; Cost functions; Microstrip devices; Microwave antennas; Mobile antennas; Nanotechnology; Optimization; Slot antennas; Bandwidth enhancement; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Fed patch antennas; Micro-strip patch antennas; Mobile communications; Optimization algorithms; Rectangular microstrip patch; Microstrip antennas",,"Taki G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053346,,,"English","Int.

In this paper an Adaptive Decision based filtering method is proposed for removing impulse noise mainly salt & pepper noise. The proposed algorithm first detect the noisy pixel, then filtering is done using decision based algorithm. The filter works very well on removing fixed valued impulse noise. With little increase in computational complexity over basic median filter, these algorithms works well on different noise ratios. This paper also proposes hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm for real time execution. Implementations are checked on Artix-7 FPGA development board of XC7A100T-1csg324c device family using VHDL programming language in vivado 2015 design tools.

Set point filter is widely used for reducing peak overshoot in various procees. There are different anti integral windup methods such as back calculation and conditional integration are used for eliminating integral windup action, which improves system performance. For achieving the advantage of set point filter and anti integral windup strategy, a newly proposed method of set point filter based anti integral windup PID controller with integral state predictor is used in thermal process. PID controller is used in a process, due to integral windup phenomenon, performance degradation and large peak overshoot will appear. The steady state value of integral state is predicted while PID controller output is saturated and its value is utilized as initial value of integral state when PID controller begins to operate in a linear range. Set point filter is designed by using peak overshoot and peak time of system response. The proposed method is applied on FOPDT transfer function of a thermal process and studied using MATLAB Simulink tool. The Simulation results shows that performance of the process is improved and peak overshoot is reduced. © 2017 IEEE.","Anti Integral Windup; FOPDT; Intergral state Predictor; PID Controller; Setpoint Filter","Bandpass filters; Controllers; Electric control equipment; MATLAB; Proportional control systems; Signal processing; Three term control systems; Anti Integral Windup; FOPDT; Intergral state Predictor; PID controllers; Setpoints; Process control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049295,,,"English","Proc.

The experimental evaluation of sparse banded matrix filter is done on a standard face database (Yale). Edge detection is the process of locating the sharp discontinuity in an image. It is a basic tool which is used in many image processing applications such as face recognition. In this paper, we have compared the performance of sparse banded matrix filter with existing edge detecting filters such as Sobel, Prewitt, Canny and Robert.

It is observed that passband with ripple can suitably be tailored by varying the defect density. Critical dimension is predicted for different layers over which the effect of sandwiched layer becomes insignificant, i.e., the structure will behave as binary one.

For this a new idea is proposed which aims at designing a Gabor filter that makes accurate detection of diseases. We use an efficient pipelined architecture for input. Image segmentation for the detection of diseases is done using Gabor filter that in turn uses shift-add CORDIC algorithm for making the designing of Gabor filter easier. In addition to this algorithm, we use a new algorithm called Variable Thresholding algorithm that sets a threshold value during the decision making period. The algorithm is named variable because, the threshold value can be varied depending upon the diseases we are going to detect. All these algorithms are written in VHDL Language in MODELSIM software, which makes the designing and decision making process more effective. This technique is also implemented on FPGA/CPLD kit that shows us the presence of disease manually through lighting of LED's. Thus the decision of disease is made more accurate and faster through this design. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bandpass filters; Computer hardware description languages; Decision making; Image segmentation; Signal processing; CORDIC algorithms; Decision making process; Design and implementations; Disease detection; Modelsim software; Pipelined architecture; Threshold-value; Thresholding algorithms; Gabor filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049295,,,"English","Proc.

Among assorts of neuroimaging techniques, electroencephalogram (EEG) is among one of the non-invasive methods exploited mostly in BCI studies. Recent studies have shown that Motor Imagery (MI) based BCI can be used as a rehabilitation tool for patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities. The spatial and spectral information related to brain activities associated with BCI paradigms are usually predetermined as default in EEG analysis without speculation, which can lead to loses effects in practical applications due to individual variability across different subjects. Recent studies have shown that feature combination of each specifically tailored for different physiological phenomena such as Readiness Potential (RP) and Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) might benefit BCI making it robust against artifacts. Hence, the objective is to design a CSSBP with combined feature vectors, where the signal is divided into several sub bands using a band pass filter, and this channel and frequency configurations are then modeled as preconditions before learning base learners and introducing a new heuristic of stochastic gradient boost for training the base learners under these preconditions. The effectiveness and robustness of this algorithm along with feature combination is evaluated on two different data sets recorded from distinct populations. Results showed that Boosting approach with feature combination clearly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms, and improved the classification performance and resulted in increased robustness. This method can also be used to explore the neurophysiological mechanism of underlying brain activities.","Brain computer interface; Feature combination; Motor imagery; Rehabilitation training; Spatial-spectral precondition; Stochastic gradient boosting","Bandpass filters; Bioinformatics; Brain; Electroencephalography; Interfaces (computer); Neuroimaging; Neurophysiology; Neurosurgery; Noninvasive medical procedures; Patient rehabilitation; Population statistics; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Feature combination; Motor imagery; Rehabilitation training; Spatial-spectral precondition; Stochastic gradient boosting; Brain computer interface",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353229,,,"English","ACM Int.

A mammogram can identify abnormal areas in the breast that look like a cancer but turns out to be normal, this leads to false positive. Mammogram images are found to be difficult to interpret so a CAD is becoming an increasingly important tool to assist radiologist in the mammographic lesion interpretation.

A wall shaped raised ground structure (RGS) is used around the stacked rectangular microstrip patch to widen the beamwidth. A material with very low dielectric constant is used to fill the space left between RGS and two layers of rectangular microstrip patch. Low dielectric constant makes the antenna less dependent on the finite size of ground plane or the host structure due to the absence of higher order modes of surface waves and retains the purity of broad radiation beam. In order to separate radiating patch from its feeding structure and for circular polarization (CP), a crossed slot aperture coupled technique is used. A nozzle shaped conformal radome is used to protect antenna from the environmental hazards and to reduce aerodynamic drag as well. It is observed that antenna provides excellent electrical and radiation characteristics. 10-dB Return loss bandwidth of 30%, 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 15%, realized gain of 6.2 dBiC, 3-dB beamwidth of 110° × 110° and 3-dB axial ratio beamwidth of 170° × 175° at center frequency of 9.45 GHz of X-band are observed. © 2017 IEEE.","broadband; circularly polarised; conformal radome; microstrip patch; widebeam","Aerodynamic drag; Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Circular polarization; Directional patterns (antenna); Microstrip devices; Microwave antennas; Nozzles; Radomes; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Surface waves; broadband; circularly polarised; Micro-strip patch antennas; Microstrip patch; Polarized microstrip patch antennas; Radiation characteristics; Rectangular microstrip patch; Wide-beam; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509056194,,,"English","Proc.

By careful design of planar log-periodic antennas with impedance matching we get large bandwidth. The chebyshev impedance matching is one of the best techniques to produce large bandwidth in log-periodic antenna. In this paper four arm log-periodic antenna is designed for the both linear and circular polarization. When the 900 phase delay applied between the two dipoles the antenna produce circular polarization. The antenna is operated at 3GHz gives the band of operation from 2GHz band upto K/Ka band. According to IEEE 802.11 the 5.1GHz to 5.8GHz band is occupied for Wi-Fi applications. So there is a need to eliminate the Wi-Fi band by using integrating filter method. The antenna is designed and simulated by using HFSS software, the variation of voltage standing wave ratio(VSWR), return loss and axial ratio plots are generated from 2GHz to 18GHz.

We already had known that the speckle noise which corrupts the visual estimation of UltraSound [US] imaging is a multiplicative noise. The searches for efficient despeckling filters are still a proper challenge at the crossing of statistics and functional analysis. The aim of this work was to carry out a brief study of speckle denoising filters. The denoising filters studied in this paper are grouped under the following types such as adaptive filters, Partial Differential Equation [PDE] based filters, transform domain filters, non-local restoration filters and fuzzy logic based filters. The study of these filters shows the following results. Adaptive filters are based on the statement that the Speckle noise is basically a multiplicative noise. PDE based approaches used PDEs by defining a suitable cost function. Threshold estimation for transform domain is an essential problem in transform domain systems. Non-local restoration filters performed well when compared with the other state of art filters. Different fuzzy logic based filters are presented to eliminate the speckle noise in medical images. Fuzzy rule based filters is an alternative solution for the classical logical system. Finally, we end that, the right choice of a despeckle filter is very essential in the development of US images. © 2017 IEEE.","Despeckling filters; fuzzy logic; Partial differential equation; Speckle noise; Ultrasound images","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Computer circuits; Cost functions; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Image enhancement; Medical imaging; Partial differential equations; Phase noise; Restoration; Speckle; Alternative solutions; De-speckling; Imaging applications; Multiplicative noise; PDE-based approaches; Speckle noise; Transform domain filter; Ultrasound images; Fuzzy filters","Nageswari, P.; Department of Mathematics, Erode Arts and Science CollegeIndia; email: pnageswari@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055555,,,"English","Conf.

The proposed system consist of three phase three winding transformer with star connected secondary winding which is tapped to shunt connected active power filter. This types of transformer arrangement rundowns the filter side voltage, avoiding the demand of high bandwidth step-down transformer. That type of arrangement reduces voltage rating of APF switches and also increasing frequency of switching limit.

Conventionally power quality improvement was done through passive filters, shunt filter and series filter but they suffer from problems like resonance, fixed compensation and other PQ problems. Therefore in order to eradicate these issues some hybrid combination of filters including passive and active power filter (APF) are used. This paper proposes an analysis and comparative study of two different schemes of hybrid active power filter (HAPF). HAPF is configured with the arrangement of series, passive and shunt filter. One arrangement is modeled with shunt passive filter linked in series with shunt active filter and the other is designed with series active filter and shunt passive filter. For both the schemes of hybrid filter, different control strategy and power circuit design are considered. Finally for individual configuration the control and compensation design is proved by simulation. © 2017 IEEE.","Active filters; Harmonics; Hybrid filters; Passive filters; Power quality; Total harmonic distortion (THD)","Active filters; Bandpass filters; Computer circuits; Integrated circuit manufacture; Power quality; Harmonics; Hybrid active power filter; Hybrid filters; Individual configuration; Power quality disturbances; Power quality improvement; Series active filters; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Passive filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049660,,,"English","Proc.

First, ergodic channel capacity and distribution capacity in terms of outage channel capacity is analyzed for variable MIMO-PSK systems without knowing the transmitter channel state information (CSI).

In low power VLSI designs an adaptive filter can obtain a reduction in terms of area and power consumption. A system with a linear transfer function controlled by variable parameters and a means to adjust those parameters according to an optimization algorithm is called adaptive filter. The Least Mean Square (LMS) filter is one of adaptive filters type which is used commonly, because of its simplicity and also because of its satisfactory convergence performance. The current IIR adaptive filter uses LMS to reduce area-delay product and energy-delay product. To reduce this delay one can implement filter in pipelined structure. Shift-add tree efficiently minimizes the critical path and silicon area without increasing the number of adaptation delays. The structure of IIR adaptive filter designing is done by using two main blocks: IIR block and new coefficients block (weights block). Weights block consists of series of partial product generators and shift/add tree. Partial product generators has 2 to 3 decoders and AND/OR cells. Weights block performs multiply accumulate operations. Filter block depends upon on the new filter coefficients obtaining from weights block. The proposed filter is designed in MATLAB (2013a) for its performance characteristics and its constraints are verified using XILINX (verl4.7) implemented on FPGA. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive filter; Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm; Weights block; Xilinx system generator","Adaptive filtering; Artificial intelligence; Bandpass filters; Big data; Forestry; IIR filters; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit testing; Optimization; Power management; Design and implementations; Least mean square algorithms; Linear transfer function; Multiply accumulate operations; Optimization algorithms; Performance characteristics; Weights block; Xilinx system generator; Adaptive filters",,"Niranjan Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063994,,,"English","Proc.

But the mobile communication at these mmWave spectrum band is far more complex than the current frequencies that are being used around the world as signal suffers higher propagation loss. Antennas for next generation 5G will make use of shorter element size at high frequencies to incorporate beamformation capabilities. Here, a new beamformation strategy that overcomes the limitation of RF beamformation and Basebandbeamformation known as Hybrid beamformation (HBF) is presented. In this paper, we achieved very narrow 3dBtransmit antenna beamwidthof almost 12 degree. This helps to increase the capacity of cellular network by improving signal to noise ratio (SNR). The narrow transmit beam that we achieved in our paper lowers the amount of interference in the radio environment and simultaneously makes it possible to maintain signal power at the receiver terminal even at larger distances. This paper offers a simulation result that shows an optimal BER (Bit Error Rate) can be maintained at mmWave frequencies. In reality, the propagation loss and fading with the use of mmWave will be compensated with Hybrid antenna beamformation. This gives us the motivation for exploiting mmWave frequencies for next generation 5G communication. © 2017 IEEE.","3dB antenna beamwidth; 5G; Baseband beamformation; BER; cellular communication; channel bandwidth; data rate; HBF; interference; mmWave; RF beamformation; SNR","Acoustic bulk wave devices; Antennas; Bandwidth; Bit error rate; Cellular radio systems; Fading (radio); Millimeter waves; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio broadcasting; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Smart city; Wave interference; Antenna beamwidth; Beamformation; Channel bandwidth; Data rates; mm-Wave; 5G mobile communication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062553,,,"English","TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

This paper presents an optimization algorithm to ensure guaranteed bandwidth while minimizing data transfer delay between VMs. Simulation results show that the generated VM placement plan gives minimum inter-distance between allocated VMs while satisfying bandwidth requirements compared to the other existing algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Data transfer; Natural resources management; Optimization; Resource allocation; Smart city; Bandwidth requirement; Cloud infrastructures; Cloud service providers; Computing infrastructures; Data transfer delays; Guaranteed bandwidth; Increasing capacities; Optimization algorithms; Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062553,,,"English","TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

In fact, recent works design techniques that exploit fast bulk bitwise operations to accelerate databases (bitmap indices, BitWeaving) and web search (BitFunnel). Unfortunately, in existing architectures, the throughput of bulk bitwise operations is limited by the memory bandwidth available to the processing unit (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA, processing-in-memory). To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Ambit, an Accelerator-in-Memory for bulk bitwise operations. Unlike prior works, Ambit exploits the analog operation of DRAM technology to perform bitwise operations completely inside DRAM, thereby exploiting the full internal DRAM bandwidth. Ambit consists of two components. First, simultaneous activation of three DRAM rows that share the same set of sense amplifiers enables the system to perform bitwise AND and OR operations. Second, with modest changes to the sense amplifier, the system can use the inverters present inside the sense amplifier to perform bitwise NOT operations. With these two components, Ambit can perform any bulk bitwise operation efficiently inside DRAM. Ambit largely exploits existing DRAM structure, and hence incurs low cost on top of commodity DRAM designs (1% of DRAM chip area). Importantly, Ambit uses the modern DRAM interface without any changes, and therefore it can be directly plugged onto the memory bus. Our extensive circuit simulations show that Ambit works as expected even in the presence of significant process variation. Averaged across seven bulk bitwise operations, Ambit improves performance by 32X and reduces energy consumption by 35X compared to state-of-the-art systems. When integrated with Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), a 3D-stacked DRAM with a logic layer, Ambit improves performance of bulk bitwise operations by 9.7X compared to processing in the logic layer of the HMC. Ambit improves the performance of three real-world data-intensive applications, 1) database bitmap indices, 2) BitWeaving, a technique to accelerate database scans, and 3) bit-vector-based implementation of sets, by 3X-7X compared to a state-of-the-art baseline using SIMD optimizations. We describe four other applications that can benefit from Ambit, including a recent technique proposed to speed up web search. We believe that large performance and energy improvements provided by Ambit can enable other applications to use bulk bitwise operations. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bulk bitwise operations; Databases; DRAM; Energy; Memory bandwidth; Performance; Processing-in-memory","Amplifiers (electronic); Bandwidth; Circuit simulation; Computer architecture; Database systems; Energy utilization; Information retrieval; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Websites; Bitwise operations; Energy; Memory bandwidths; Performance; Processing in memory; Dynamic random access storage",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10724451,9781450349529,PSMIE,,"English","Proc.

The design is further modified for acquiring notch characteristics in the WLAN band and high front to backlobe ratio (F/B). The modifications are done on the ground plane of the antenna. Previous literatures have shown that the incorporation of planar meta-material structures on the CPW plane along the feed can produce notch characteristics. Here, a novel concept is introduced regarding antipodal vivaldi antenna. In the ground plane of the antenna, square ring resonator (SRR) structure slot and circular ring resonator (CRR) structure slot are cut to produce the notch characteristic on the WLAN band.

A lot of data created every day so the data management is become a critical task. Most of time much amount of memory wastage because of same copies present on various locations. The process of eliminating the repeated or duplicates copies of data is called as Data deduplication. This data deduplication process is widely used in cloud storage to decrease storage space and upload bandwidth. However there is only one copy of each file stored even if such a file is owned by huge number of users. By using, deduplication system progress of storage utilization and reliability is increases. In addition, the dare of privacy for sensitive data also take place when they are outsourced by users to cloud. In this we use new distributed deduplication systems with upper dependability in which the data chunks are distributed from corner to cornering multiple cloud servers. The safety needs of data privacy and tag stability are also accomplish by introducing a deterministic secret sharing scheme in distributed storage systems, instead of using convergent encryption as in previous deduplication systems. A deduplication technique, on the other hand, can reduce the storage cost at the server side and save the upload bandwidth at the user side. © 2017 IEEE.","Data comparison; Deduplication; Distributed storage system; reliability; secret sharing; Secure sharing; Tag consistency","Bandwidth; Cryptography; Data privacy; Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Reliability; Data comparisons; De duplications; Distributed storage system; Secret sharing; Secure sharing; Tag consistency; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

The secret and cover images are divided into blocks of size 4∗4. Each block in secret image is taken as a texture pattern for which the most similar block is found among the blocks of the cover image. To find the most suitable cover image with respect to the message image we have used Gabor filter to measure the similarity between texture patterns.

Since the demand on communication network increases for bandwidth hungry services such as voice, video and data, telecommunication companies greatly enhanced the capacity of fiber lines. As increasing in the research further more leads to development in Wireless optical communication. These systems work in the same IR range in which normally the Optical fiber systems work. Methods/Statistical analysis: The Free-space optical interconnection (FSOI) technology enables high interconnection speed in next-generation services. FSOI uses laser links between the transmitter and receiver provides a lower propagation delay due to the line-of-sight (LOS) path and lower index of refraction of air. The performance of the links highly dependent on different weather conditions such as Fog, Turbulence and Rain. In this paper the combined result of Fog, Rain and Turbulence on FSOI links are compared and the suitable modulation technique is suggested to increase the spacing between optical transmitter and receiver. Findings: This paper gives the idea of which modulation technique is better for outdoor environment and to multiple users. This paper shows that maximum distance of 4 km between transmitter and receiver is possible by using M-QAM (M=16).

The storage of these data requires massive memory. For communication, these data need enormous transmission bandwidth. The only solution to reduce the storage and the transmission bandwidth is the data compression. From the literature survey it is learnt that there is a need to achieve compression ratio greater than 30 with a PSNR greater than 25 dB for non critical applications. In order to facilitate this, a colour image compression method is proposed. In this method, the colour image is converted into the 'YCbCr' format using formulated New Equation Set-1. The 'Y' component matrix is divided into 16×16 blocks. The DCT is applied to all the 16×16 blocks. The DC-Coefficient of all 16×16 block DCT is taken out and zero is inserted in place of it. The data types of all the DC-coefficients are changed from the 'double' to the '16 bit integer' data type and they are stored. The transformed matrix consists of 16×16 block DCT of all the blocks. In this matrix, all those elements less than the threshold value 'th' are made zero. This matrix is decomposed into matrices 'U', 'S' and 'V' using SVD. All those elements of the matrix 'U' less than the threshold value 'thu', all those elements of the matrix 'S' less than the threshold value 'ths' and all those elements of the matrix 'V' less than the threshold value 'thv' are made zero. Then these matrices are multiplied to form one matrix such that X=USVT. All those elements of the matrix 'X' less than the threshold value 'th' are made zero. Now all the elements of the matrix 'X' are divided by 10. Then the matrix 'X' becomes a sparse matrix. This sparse matrix is represented in the 'triplet form'. The data types of the 'row values' and the 'column values' of the triplet form are converted from the 'double' to the '16 bit integer' data type. The data type of the 'data elements' of the 'triplet form' is converted into the '8 bit integer' data type. Then the RLE is applied to the 'column values' of the 'triplet form'. After this, the compressed form of the Y-Component Matrix is obtained. Similarly, the 'Cb' and the 'Cr' component matrices are compressed. Then the experiments are conducted by converting the given image into the 'YCbCr' format by the formulated New Equation Set-2, New Equation Set-3 and the basic 'YCbCr' equation. The results are compared with parameters such as Compression Ratio, PSNR, SSIM and Quality Index. Experiments are conducted using MATLAB. From the results, it can be concluded that, the compression ratio obtained from the method which has got the colour conversion using New Equation Set-1 is good. The maximum compression ratio obtained with this method is 43.5079 with a PSNR of Red, Green and Blue Component equal to 25.9583 dB, 25.7501 dB and 26.4837 dB respectively. © 2017 IEEE.","2DDCT-Two Dimension Discrete Cosine Transform; CR-Compression Ratio; DC-Direct Current; DCT-Discrete Cosine Transform; PSNR-Peak Signal to Noise Ratio; RLE-Run Length Encoding; SSIM-Structural Similarity Index Measure; SVD-Singular Value Decomposition","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Color; Digital storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Image coding; Image compression; MATLAB; Signal to noise ratio; Singular value decomposition; Uranium; Wave transmission; DCT-discrete cosine transform; Direct current; Peak signal to noise ratio; Run-length encoding; Structural similarity index measures; Two-dimension; Matrix algebra",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

In 2.3 GHz frequency band, it gives VSWR and axial ratio bandwidth of 9 and 4%, respectively. In the reported work, a detailed explanation about the working of circular polarized antenna in terms patch resonant modes and the equations/design procedure to realize similar antennas at different frequency is not explained. In this paper, an in-depth analysis which explains the effects of unequal lengths U-slot to give circularly polarized response is presented. First the equal lengths of U-slot reduce the resonance frequencies of patch TM01 and TM20 resonant modes. An unequal length in U-slot arms (asymmetrical U-slot) leads to excitation of new resonant mode whose current distribution is similar to TM01 mode of U-slot cut patch. This gives circularly polarized response. Further equations for various patch parameters for U-slot cut antenna are proposed. Using them U-slot cut patch was designed at 1500 MHz. At this frequency antenna yields VSWR and axial ratio bandwidths of 138 (9.6%) and 60 (4.3%) MHz, respectively. Thus proposed equations are useful for designing U-slot cut antenna at any given frequency on thicker air substrate. © 2017 IEEE.","Circularly polarized microstrip Antenna; Higher order mode; Square microstrip antenna; Unequal length U-slot","Antennas; Bandwidth; Circular polarization; Frequency bands; Microwave antennas; Slot antennas; Axial ratio bandwidth; Circular polarized antennas; Circularly polarized microstrip antennas; Current distribution; Higher-order modes; Resonance frequencies; Square microstrip antennas; Unequal length; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043811,,,"English","Int.

Such multi-standard wireless communication receivers (MWCRs) need filter bank to extract the desired signal of interest from wideband input spectrum and bring it to the baseband for further signal processing tasks such as spectrum sensing, modulation classification, demodulation etc. In MWCRs, rather any wireless receivers, modulated filter banks, such as Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks (DFTFB), are preferred due to their advantages such as lower area, delay and power requirements. To support multi-standard operation, reconfigurable DFTFB (RDFTFB) was proposed by integrating DFTFB with the coefficient decimation method. In this paper, an efficient high speed implementation of RDFTFB on Virtex-7 field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) has been proposed. The proposed approach minimizes the critical path delay between clocked registers thereby leading to significant improvement in the maximum operating frequency of the RDFTFB. Numerically, the proposed implementation leads to 89.7% improvement in the maximum frequency at which RDFTFB can be clocked. Furthermore, proposed implementation leads to 18.5% reduction in the dynamic power consumption. © 2016 IEEE.","Channelization; Critical path delay; FPGA; Re-configurable Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks (RDFTFB)","Bandpass filters; Clocks; Discrete Fourier transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Filter banks; Integrated circuit testing; Modulation; Radio transceivers; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal receivers; VLSI circuits; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channelization; Critical path delays; Dynamic power consumption; High speed implementation; Maximum operating frequency; Modulation classification; Next-generation wireless communications; Wireless communication receivers; Signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509014224,,,"English","Int.

The accuracy of location prediction of the vehicle is a prime concern in VANET which enhances the application performance such as automatic parking, cooperative driving, routing etc. to give some examples. Generally, in a developed country, vehicle speed varies between 0 and 60 km/h in a city due to traffic rules, driving skills and traffic density. Likewise, the movement of the vehicle with steady speed is highly impractical. Subsequently, the relationship between time and speed to reach the destination is nonlinear. With reference to the previous work on location prediction in VANET, nonlinear movement of the vehicle was not considered. Thus, a location prediction algorithm should be designed by considering nonlinear movement. This paper proposes a location prediction algorithm for a nonlinear vehicular movement using extended Kalman filter (EKF). EKF is more appropriate contrasted with the Kalman filter (KF), as it is designed to work with the nonlinear system. The proposed prediction algorithm performance is measured with the real and model based mobility traces for the city and highway scenarios.

The slew rate limitations of conventional low dropout regulator (LDR) employing folded cascode structure are overcome by fixed bias LDR (FB LDR) with the usage of recycled transistors of conventional LDR. The FB LDR with its limited input common mode range limits the transient response. The adaptive bias LDR (AB LDR) overcomes these limitations of FB LDR and further enhances the transient performance. However, fast rise and fall time demands of advanced digital technology demand the regulator to respond to corresponding fast load changes. These challenges are addressed by an additional fast reacting path. An undershoot of 89.95mV for a load current changes from 0mA to 100mA and an overshoot of 150.1mV for a current change of 100-0mA is observed for the adaptive bias transient enhanced LDR. The load regulation of 20.6μV/mA and power supply rejection (PSR) of-47.8dB@ 10kHz is achieved due to the improved closed loop gain and bandwidth of LDR.

Soft and Hard decision fusion schemes are usually employed at the fusion center to detect the presence or absence of primary user. Soft decision fusion schemes perform better than hard fusion schemes but at the cost of increased bandwidth burden on the control channel. In this context, we propose a semi-soft fusion scheme to achieve a tradeoff between sensing performance and bandwidth cost. Under this scheme, each cognitive radio makes a local decision and sends one or two-bit data to the fusion center based on the observed test statistics. On the basis of received data, fusion center estimates the global test statistics which are then compared to a predetermined threshold to make the final decision. Furthermore, a closed form expression for average bandwidth cost for the proposed scheme is also derived.

The main drawback of this technique is the requirement of sending side information (SI) to the receiver for each data block which results in huge bandwidth and power overheads. Also, it may degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system due to the corruption of SI over the channel. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to reduce PAPR in single input single output and single input multiple output OFDM systems using Hadamard code-based SLM. The proposed method eliminates the need for explicit SI resulting in better bandwidth and power efficiency. The basic idea is to embed the SI of each data block within the data block itself at some specific locations using special multiplying sequences. Furthermore, the proposed scheme yields superior PAPR reduction when compared to that of the conventional SLM for an equivalent system complexity. Simulation studies show that the receiver achieves a better BER performance with the proposed technique as compared to the conventional SLM. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF); High-power amplifier (HPA); Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM); Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); Selective mapping method (SLM); Side information (SI)","Bandwidth; Bit error rate; Distribution functions; Error statistics; Frequency division multiplexing; Mapping; Orthogonal functions; Power amplifiers; Complementary cumulative distribution functions; High power amplifier; Peak to average power ratio; Selective mapping methods; Side information; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Namitha, A.S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology CalicutIndia; email: namitha_p110084ec@nitc.ac.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025116412

In this, spectrum is shared between primary and secondary users. Secondary users also called as unlicensed users, makes use of part of spectrum which is not used by primary or licensed users. Hence secondary user systems must be capable of sensing the spectrum and should be able to reconfigure to transmit at different frequencies. For this it must consists of spectrum sensing circuit and a reconfigurable transceiver consisting of reconfigurable antenna. This paper discuss the single module of reconfigurable transceiver which dynamically allocates two different frequencies 2.4 and 3.1 GHz for transmission.

Gabor's uncertainty principle states that a function cannot be localized in time and frequency domain simultaneously and there exists a nonzero lower bound of 0.25 on the product of its time variance and frequency variance called time–frequency product (TFP). Using arithmetic mean (AM)– geometric mean (GM) inequality, product of variances and sum of variances can be related and it can be shown that sum of variances has lower bound of one. In this paper, we compute the frequency variance of the filter from its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose an equivalent summation based discrete-time uncertainty principle which has the lower bound of one. We evaluate the performance of the proposed discrete-time time–frequency uncertainty measure in multiresolution setting and show that the proposed DFT based concentration measure generate sequences which are even more localized in time and frequency domain than that obtained from the Slepian, Ishii and Furukawa's concentration measures. The proposed design approach provides the flexibility in which the TFP can be made arbitrarily close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 by increasing the length of the filter. In the other proposed approach, the sum of the time variance and frequency variance is used to formulate a positive definite matrix to measure the time–frequency joint localization of a bandlimited function from its samples. We design the time–frequency localized bandlimited low pass scaling and band pass wavelet functions using the eigenvectors of the formulated positive definite matrix. The samples of the time–frequency localized bandlimited function are obtained from the eigenvector of the positive definite matrix corresponding to its minimum eigenvalue. The TFP of the designed bandlimited scaling and wavelet functions are close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 and 2.25 respectively. We propose a design method for time–frequency localized three-band biorthogonal linear phase (BOLP) wavelet perfect reconstruction filter bank (PRFB) wherein the free parameters can be optimized for time–frequency localization of the synthesis basis functions for the specified frequency variance of the analysis scaling function. The performance of the designed filter bank is evaluated in classification of seizure and seizure-free electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It is found that the proposed filter bank outperforms other existing methods for the classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Discrete Fourier transform; Discrete time Fourier transform; Prolate spheroid sequence; Three-band wavelet filter bank; Time-frequency localization","Bandpass filters; Design; Design for testability; Discrete Fourier transforms; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electroencephalography; Filter banks; Frequency domain analysis; Matrix algebra; Signal processing; Discrete time Fourier transform; Electroencephalogram signals; Perfect reconstruction filter banks (PRFB); Positive-definite matrices; Prolate spheroid; Time and frequency domains; Time-frequency localization; Wavelet filter banks; Biomedical signal processing","Bhati, D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, BombayIndia; email: bhatidinesh@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",10512004,,DSPRE,,"English","Digital Signal Process Rev J",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026192992

Optical Fibre cable is used as media to design long/short network and it supports high bandwidth in Gigabits per second speed. Earlier OFC is used to connect the long distance places and called Optical Transport Network and presently used even in local/Access network called Optical Access Network. In present environment data to be transmitted is so high due to growth in internet. Successful transmission of such a huge bandwidth is big challenging job for long distance network designer. All customers require the QOS and they are interested to make SLA for their service to be obtained from Service provider. ISP should design their network to support the customer requirement suitably otherwise ISP cannot survive in this competitive environment. This paper aims to explain the design and planning of a passive optical network based fiber to the home architecture. The main idea of this paper is to build a fabricated environment that allows us to analyse the depth on FTTx networks and decide which is the most preferable option for this environment. Finally, the simulation software that meets the design requirements will be chosen, the design of passive optical network will be made and the results justify that the network is more viable and can be implemented in a real time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Digital subscriber line (DSL); Fibre to the home (FTTH); Optical distribution network; Passive optical network (PON); Splitters and point to point link","Bandwidth; Computer software; Digital subscriber lines; Fiber optic networks; Fiber to the x; Fibers; Home networks; Internet service providers; Modems; Network architecture; Next generation networks; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Passive networks; Signal systems; Telecommunication lines; Telephone lines; Competitive environment; Customer requirements; Digital Subscriber Line (DSL); Gigabits per second; Optical access networks; Optical distribution networks; Optical transport networks; Point-to-point link; Passive optical networks","Praveena, S.M.; ECE Department, Sri Ramakrishna Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: praveena.infant@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019675268

Design of an appropriate digital filter demands such filter coefficients that will create the desired frequency response with tolerable amount of ripples in the stop band(s) and pass band(s) along with high attenuation in the stop band(s). Now-a-days, artificial evolutionary methods are employed in the modern digital filter design due to lots of advantages over typical methods. In this paper, multipurpose digital linear phase double band filter (LPDBF) is designed proposing a hybrid meta-heuristic technique called hybrid firefly differential evolution (HFDE) algorithm. Generally these filters are required in different specific modern digital system networks for the simultaneous processing of signals present in two or three different channels. The proposed HFDE is an efficient evolutionary hybrid technique and is modelled considering both the optimization advantages of improved differential evolution (IDE) and firefly techniques. The global searching capability of IDE technique is strengthened by improved firefly movement.

Computational efficiency of the proposed technique for exploration in search space is examined, and during exploration, stability of filter is maintained by considering lattice representation of the denominator polynomials, which requires less computational complexity as well as it improves the exploration ability in search space for designing higher filter taps.

The flat IP-based LTE and LTE-Advanced technologies are the expected key drivers for 5G. However, LTE, with its elapsed security mechanism and open nature, leaves a huge loophole for intruders to jeopardize the entire communication network. The time-And bandwidth-consuming authentication procedure in LTE leads to service disruptions and makes it unfit for public safety applications. To cater the prevailing LTE security and service requirements, we propose the 4G plus relative authentication model (4G+RAM), which is composed of two dependent protocols: 1) Privacy-protected evolved packet system authentication and key agreement protocol for the initial authentication (PEPS-AKA) and 2) 4G plus frequency-based re-Authentication protocol for the re-Authentication of known and frequent users (4G+FRP). The 4G+RAM supports seamless communication with a minimum signaling load on core elements and conceals users' permanent identifiers to ensure user privacy. We simulate the proposed protocols for formal security verification with the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool.

The RF source is connected to an optical destination through a decode-and-forward relay having RF/FSO capabilities. Each link in SIMO-RF hop is assumed to experience independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Nakagami-m fading. For FSO hop, a unified novel expression for the probability density function (PDF) of irradiance has been derived which unifies Gamma-Gamma and generalised-K (KG) distributions with misalignment error. Moreover, we obtain a unified PDF of instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by unifying the heterodyne detection and intensity modulation/direct detection schemes. Utilising the unified PDF, we derive novel unified closed-form expressions for average symbol error probability (for different RF modulation techniques), outage probability, and ergodic capacity for the system under consideration.

In mobile communications, the time varying nature of signals and noise makes this issue more challenging. Among conventional signal processing techniques, finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) structures provide their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Though gamma filters in FIR and IIR forms have been suggested for noise cancellation in speech, it is bottlenecked due to issue such as longer convergence time, delay generation and inability to provide phase variation compensation. This paper presents certain techniques to overcome this issue. Firstly, a modified gamma filter with a feedback structure is used to improve MSE convergence and provide better phase variation correction. The second method uses a transfer function approach for phase correction of the filtered signal. Experiments show that the MSE and phase difference(in degree) between the filtered signal and the desired signal are lower for the proposed structure than the MSE and phase difference values obtained for the FIR filter and original gamma filter structure. Thus the suggested techniques have been found to be more reliable and efficient. © 2017 IEEE.","FIR(Finite Impulse Response); IIR(Infinite Impulse Response); LMS(Least Mean Square); MSE(Mean Square Error)","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; FIR filters; IIR filters; Impulse response; Mean square error; Spurious signal noise; Feedback structure; Finite-impulse response; Infinite impulse response; Least mean squares; Mobile communications; MSE(Mean Square Error); Noise cancellation; Signal processing technique; Signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

Here the non-uniform filter bank is obtained by first designing a uniform filter bank and then merging suitable bands to obtain the desired non-uniform structure. In hearing aids, narrow channels with adjustable gains can be allocated to those frequency regions of the audiogram with sharp transition, whereas wider passband channels can be allocated to frequency regions with slower transitions. The latter can be done by merging the bands in those regions. Merging reduces the number of channels in the filter bank, which in turn reduces the hardware complexity in terms of the number of multipliers and adders. It is shown in this paper that both matching error and hardware complexity are lower than the state-of-the-art techniques for all types of hearing losses. © 2017 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.","Audiogram fitting; Matching error; Non-uniform filter banks","Bandpass filters; Discrete Fourier transforms; Filter banks; Hardware; Hearing aids; Merging; Audiogram fitting; Design of hardwares; Digital hearing aids; Matching error; Modified discrete Fourier transforms; Non-uniform filter-banks; State-of-the-art techniques; Uniform filter bank; Audition","Sakthivel, V.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology CalicutIndia; email: sakthi517@nitc.ac.in",,"Springer London",18631703,,,,"English","Signal Image Video Process.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029760559

Interconnect performance is one of the contributing factors for overall performance of HPC system. Most popular interface to connect Network Interface Card (NIC) to CPU is PCI express (PCIe). With denser core counts in compute servers and increasingly maturing fabric interconnect speeds, there is need to maximize the packet data movement throughput between system memory and fabric interface network buffers, such that the rate at which applications (CPU) generating data is matched with rate at which fabric consumes the same. Thus PCIe throughput for small and medium messages (Programmed Input/Output) needs to be improved, to synchronize with core processing rate and fabric speeds. And there is scope for this improvement by increasing the payload size in Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) of PCIe. Traditionally, CPU issues memory writes in 8 bytes (payload for TLP), underutilizing the PCIe bus since overhead compared to payload is more. Write combining can increase the payload size in TLP, leading to more efficient utilization of available bus bandwidth, thereby improving the overall throughput.This work evaluates the performance that could be gained by using Write Combine Buffers (WCB) available on Intel CPU, for send side interface of HPC interconnect. These buffers are used for aggregating the small (usually 8 bytes) memory mapped I/O stores, to form the bigger PCIe Transaction Level Packets (TLP), which leads to better bus bandwidth utilization. It is observed that, this technique improves peak PIO bandwidth by 2x compared to normal PIO. It is also observed that till 4096 bytes write combine enabled PIO outperforms DMA. © 2017 IEEE.","HPC interconnect; Network I/O; PCI bus bandwidth; Write-combining","Bandwidth; Buses; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Interfaces (computer); System buses; Throughput; Contributing factor; HPC interconnect; Interconnect performance; Network I/O; Network interface cards; PCI bus; Transaction layer packets; Write-combining; Computer peripheral equipment",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15525244,9781538623268,,,"English","Proc.

Network on Chip (NoC) is a well known scalable communication paradigm to avoid the communication bottleneck in bus based communications. Reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAS) are particularly suited for applications that can be broken into a number of different tasks. Reconfigurability of tasks at runtime enhances the system performance metrics. In earlier literatures, Operating System (OS) was used as the medium, for communication between different tasks at run time. This approach provided significant bottlenecks, as Operating System was using the low bandwidth Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) and Processor Configuration Access Port (PCAP) for communication between tasks and itself. In this paper, a novel NoC structure is used as the communication interface between different tasks. This approach releases the Operating System from managing the inter task communications. This will result in high bandwidth communication between different tasks. A novel architecture router for NoC which has been proposed removes the head of line blocking by using a dedicated head flit first in first out (FIFO) buffer and data flits being stored in different FIFOs for each input port with a control logic dedicated for this operation. It also removes the requirement for tail flit by introducing the number of data flits in the head flit itself. Also, in order to improve reliability level, we incorporate the novel partially reconfigurable Error Detection and Correction techniques in this NoC.

Increased adoptions can be attributed to their high bandwidth, low latency and excellent random I/O performance. Owing to this high performance, multiple I/O intensive services can now be co-located on the same server. SSDs also introduce periodic latency spikes due to garbage collection. This, combined with multi-tenancy increases latency unpredictability since co-located applications now compete for CPU, memory, and disk bandwidth. The combination of these latency spikes and unpredictability lead to long tail latencies that can significantly decrease the system performance at scale. In this paper, we present a rack-level scheduling algorithm, which dynamically detects and shifts workloads with long tail latencies within servers in the same rack. Different from the global resource management methods, rack-level scheduling utilizes lightweight containers to minimize data movement and message passing overheads, leading to a much more efficient solution to reduce tail latency.With the algorithms implemented in the storage driver of the containerization infrastructure, it becomes viable to deploy and migrate applications in existing server racks without extensive modifications to storage, OS and other subsystems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Containers; Digital storage; Message passing; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Ubiquitous computing; Co-located; Data movements; Disk bandwidth; Garbage collection; Global resources; High bandwidth; Low latency; Multi tenancies; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538634868,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The framework is demonstrated through pipelined implementations of two recently proposed adaptive filtering algorithms based on logarithmic cost, namely, least mean logarithmic square (LMLS) and least logarithmic absolute difference (LLAD). To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architectures are the first attempts to implement both LMLS and LLAD algorithms in hardware. We derive error computing algorithms to realize the nonlinear error functions for LMLS and LLAD and map them onto hardware. We also propose a novel variable-α scheme to enhance the original LMLS algorithm and prove its robustness and suitability for VLSI implementations in practical applications. Detailed bit width and error analysis are carried out for the proposed VLSI fixed point implementations. Postlayout implementation results show that with an additional multiplier over conventional least mean square (LMS), 7-dB improvement in steady-state mean square deviation performance can be achieved and with the proposed variable-α scheme, 12-dB improvement can be achieved without compromising the convergence. We will show that LMLS can potentially replace LMS in practical applications, by demonstrating a proof-of-concept by extending the framework to transform domain adaptive filters. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive filters; fixed-point arithmetic; least mean square/fourth (LMS/LMF) algorithm; logarithmic number system (LNS); mean square deviation (MSD)","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Errors; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Number theory; Numbering systems; VLSI circuits; Adaptive filtering algorithms; Fixed-point implementation; Least mean square (LMS); Logarithmic number system; Mean square deviation; Pipelined implementation; Proposed architectures; Transform-domain adaptive filters; Adaptive filtering","Mula, S.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT KharagpurIndia; email: svmula@iitkgp.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10638210,,IEVSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Very Large Scale Integr VLSI Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019965048

The antenna resonates at 4.5 GHz when a half wavelength slot section is fed by the coplanar waveguide line. The fundamental resonant frequency is lowered by 2.05 GHz when the slot antenna is loaded with a pair of SRR at the end of the half wavelength slot section. The additional inductive and capacitive reactance of the resonator enables the patch to resonate at lower frequency (2.45 GHz). The proposed antenna structure reduces the resonant frequency with respect to the reference antenna (slot antenna without SRR) by 45.5%, causing the patch to almost reach an electrically small size. Finally, asymmetrical slot has been used and a wide band antenna of band width 900 MHz has been achieved. Despite the loaded patch touching the electrically small limit, the antenna needs no matching networks, offers high efficiency and exhibits a bandwidth better than the unperturbed patch. The radiation pattern is also seen to be unaffected by the presence of the SRR. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CPW-fed; Electrically small antenna and wideband antenna; Slot antenna; SRR","Antenna feeders; Bandwidth; Coplanar waveguides; Directional patterns (antenna); Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Natural frequencies; Optical resonators; Resonators; Ring gages; Spiral antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna structures; Capacitive reactance; Coplanar waveguide lines; CPW-fed; Fundamental resonant frequencies; Reference antennas; Wideband antenna; Wireless application; Slot antennas","Ghosh, C.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, B.

The system is primarily affected by the time-varying, norm bounded, mismatched parametric uncertainty. Aperiodic exchange of information is done due to bandwidth constraint of the communication network. An event-triggered based robust control strategy is adopted to reduce the effects of system uncertainty in such bandwidth constrained networks. In event-triggered control, the control input is computed and actuated at the system end only when a pre-specified event condition is violated. The robust control input is derived to stabilize the uncertain system by solving an optimal control problem based on a virtual nominal dynamics and a modified cost-functional. It is shown that the robust control law with aperiodic information ensures input-to-state stability (ISS) of the original system in the presence of mismatched uncertainty. Deriving the event-triggering condition for a discrete-time uncertain system and ensuring the stability of such system analytically are the key contributions of this technical note. A numerical example is given to prove the efficacy of the proposed event-based control algorithm over the conventional periodic one. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Discrete-time event-triggered control; discrete-time robust control; input to state stability; mismatched uncertainty; optimal control","Bandwidth; Control theory; Linear systems; Networked control systems; Optimal control systems; Robust control; System stability; Uncertain systems; Uncertainty analysis; Discrete time; Discrete time linear systems; Discrete-time uncertain systems; Event-triggered controls; Input-to-state stability; Mismatched uncertainty; Optimal controls; Parametric uncertainties; Discrete time control systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189286,,IETAA,,"English","IEEE Trans Autom Control",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029846259

Quality of video streaming primarily depends on factors including: device’s features, available bandwidth, and video codec. Existing video streaming techniques do not provide smooth streaming since the streaming quality depends only on estimating the available bandwidth ignoring the device’s static and dynamic features. This research work concentrates on hybrid features of device, i.e. static and dynamic features and also the network features for enhancing video streaming quality. This is achieved by using the following three components (Tristate): Static grade point calculator, energy manager and hybrid bandwidth estimator for estimating quality states respectively. Using the statistical features extracted from the three components, the state machine decision maker with novel ensemble-based adaptive learning algorithm decides on the quality of the video to be streamed. Main objective of this work is to provide scalable, robust video streaming with the services of Tristate components and the development of a novel ensemble-based adaptive learning algorithm to achieve quality of service. This proposed technique is tested with cloud open stack platform under various network conditions like motion, driving and train. The experimental results are compared with those of the existing techniques and the results indicate that the proposed work outperforms other schemes in terms of metrics like PSNR, Bandwidth Estimation, and Smoothness in streaming, Power Consumption Rate, Freeze time and computational time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bandwidth estimator; Cloud computing; Energy manager; Quality of service; State decision maker; Video streaming","Bandwidth; Cloud computing; Decision making; Estimation; Machine components; Managers; Quality of service; Video streaming; Adaptive learning algorithm; Available bandwidth; Bandwidth estimation; Bandwidth estimators; Decision makers; Energy managers; Power consumption rates; Statistical features; Learning algorithms","Kesavaraja, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr. Sivanthi Aditanar College of EngineeringIndia; email: dkesavraj@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019577432

Earlier OFC is used to connect the long distance places and called Optical transport network and presently used even in local/Access network called Optical Access network. In present environment data to be transmitted is so high due to growth in internet. Successful transmission of such a huge bandwidth is big challenging job for long distance network designer. This paper aims to explain the design and planning of a Passive Optical Network (PON) based wireless fibre to the Home architecture. The purpose is to show the behaviour of links of optical fibre when the signal goes through all the elements such as optical fibre, splitters, multiplexers and the goal is to find a good quality of signal in all receivers. The final goal pursued with this paper is to evaluate the performance of the whole system. The steady increase in the demand for broadband services and the consequent increase in the volume of generated traffic in our communication networks have motivated the need to implement next generation access networks in our territories. To develop multimedia telecommunication networks as an infrastructure, it is necessary to install highly reliable optical fibre cable network architecture like PON based fibre to the Home Network. In a point-to-multipoint architecture, PON is an appropriate architecture to provide high bandwidth for many customers. For any Internet Service Providers, the biggest challenge is to design an efficient access network like PON to ensure the QoS and maintenance of that network that includes Identification and Rectification of cable faults in that access network within short time thus enabling efficiency and reputation of ISPs. So this work deals with design and analysis of access network like PON and also the maintenance of the access network which includes Identification and Rectification of optical fibre cable faults in PON based fibre to the Home Network. The quality of this fibre infrastructure/network is monitored by Optical Time Domain Reflectometer for observing losses and fibre breaks and its efficiency is improved by Centralized Fault Detection System. The hardware implementation of the access network like PON based wireless fibre to the Home Network and the testing instruments are also considered for fault identification. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Central office (CO); Centralized fault detection system; Digital subscriber line (DSL); Fiber to the home (FTTH); Optical transport network (OTN); Quality of Service (QOS)","Bandwidth; Cables; Digital subscriber lines; Efficiency; Fault detection; Fiber optic networks; Fiber to the x; Fibers; Hardware; Home networks; Instrument testing; Internet service providers; Modems; Network architecture; Next generation networks; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Passive networks; Personal communication systems; Quality of service; Reflectometers; Signal receivers; Signal systems; Telecommunication lines; Telephone lines; Central offices; Digital Subscriber Line (DSL); Fault detection systems; Hardware implementations; Next generation access networks; Optical access networks; Optical time domain reflectometer; Optical transport networks; Passive optical networks","Mary Praveena, S.; ECE Department, Sri Ramakrishna Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: marypraveena.ece@srit.org",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018814489

However, bootstrapping is influenced by several factors like limitation on the maximum number of connections a peer can have due to bandwidth constraints, limitation on the availability of information of existing peers due to cache size constraints and also by the attachment policy of the newly arriving peers to the resourceful peers. In this paper, we derive closed form equations that model the effect of these factors on superpeer related topological properties of the networks. Based on the model, we show that existing bootstrapping protocols can lead to a situation where only a small fraction of the resourceful peers gets converted to superpeers, i.e., a large fraction of them remain underutilized; we later validate this statement using real Gnutella snapshots. We observe that as a node attachment policy, newly arriving peers must use a combination of random and preferential attachment strategy so as to ensure proper utilization of the resourceful peers. We also show that the cache parameters must also be suitably tuned so as to increase the fraction of superpeers in the network. Finally, we show that in real Gnutella networks the degree distribution generated using our models suitably fits the corresponding empirical values. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bootstrapping protocols; Degree distribution; Preferential attachment; Rate equation; Superpeer networks; Webcache","Bandwidth; Degree distributions; Preferential attachments; Rate equations; Superpeer networks; Webcache; Topology","Chandra, J.; Indian Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: joydeep@iitp.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15741192,,,,"English","Pervasive Mob.

The main challenges while designing a textile antenna were to provide adequate thickness, surface uniformity and water wettability to the textile substrate. Here, three layers of polyester fabric were stacked together in order to obtain sufficient thickness, and were subsequently dip coated with polyvinyl butyral (PVB) solution. The PVB-coated polyester fabric showed a hydrophobic nature with a contact angle of 91°. The RMS roughness of the uncoated and PVB-coated polyester fabric was about 341 nm and 15 nm respectively. The promising properties, such as their flexibility, light weight and cost effectiveness, enable effortless integration of the proposed antenna into clothes like polyester jackets. Simulated and measured results in terms of return loss as well as gain were showcased to confirm the usefulness of the fabricated prototype.

Recently, ANN model relating the physical and electromagnetic parameters of the fractal antenna to be designed is used as objective function of the optimization algorithm and it has been shown as an effective approach. In presented paper, ANN ensemble model has been used as the objective function of a PSO algorithm to calculate the optimal dimensions of a circular fractal antenna for desired resonant frequency. It has been established that ANN ensemble has better performance than the constituent ANN models. The design accuracy of the proposed hybrid algorithm is validated through the simulation and experimental results of the designed antenna. The size reduction capability of the proposed fractal antenna is used to design an antenna for 5.8 GHz WLAN band with a size reduction of 41.64% compared to simple circular microstrip antenna.

Moreover, the growing bandwidth demand is foreseen to immensely pressurize content delivery networks (CDNs) in the near future. CDNs stream these services through the core network on a per-user basis. Hence, the bandwidth consumed by a CDN increases when content is requested by multiple users. In this paper, we propose optical access network (OAN) architectures and associated media access control protocols that enhance the end-user bandwidth by facilitating supervised sharing of content among end users with security. This is an attractive solution for OANs, which otherwise require technology upgrade and redeployment of fiber infrastructure for enhancing the end-user bandwidth. The proposed schemes provide bandwidth benefits in the access network which are simultaneously observed at the metro and core network levels. In comparison, competent technologies like caching and P2P solutions provide bandwidth benefits at the metro and core network levels only, and do not enhance the enduser bandwidth. Analytical models are derived for the schemes proposed in this paper, as well as the caching and CDN solutions, in order to compare bandwidth benefits. Validation of the analytical models is performed using simulations. © 2017 OSA.","Content distribution strategies; Optical access network architecture; Video caching","Access control; Analytical models; Bandwidth; Medium access control; Network protocols; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Attractive solutions; Content delivery network; Content distribution; Internet services; Media access control protocol; Optical access networks; Technology upgrade; Video caching; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19430620,,,,"English","J.of Opt.

Automated Video Surveillance (AVS) systems are established to automatically monitor objects in real-time. Employing wireless communication in an AVS system is an attractive solution due to its convenient installation and configuration. Unfortunately, wireless communication, in general, has limited bandwidth, not to mention the intrinsic dynamic conditions of the network (e.g., collision and congestion). Many solutions have been proposed in the literature to solve the bandwidth allocation problem in wireless networks, but much less work is done to design evaluation frameworks for such solutions. This paper targets the demand for a realistic wireless AVS system simulation framework that models and simulates most of the details in a typical wireless AVS framework. The proposed simulation framework is built over the well-known NS-3 network simulator. This framework also supports the testing and the evaluation of cross-layer solutions that manages many factors over different layers of AVS systems in the wireless 802.11 infrastructure network. Moreover, the simulation framework supports the collection of many used performance metrics that are usually used in AVS system performance evaluation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Automated Video Surveillance; Bandwidth optimization; Online bandwidth estimation; Simulation framework; Video distortion","Automation; Bandwidth; Monitoring; Real time systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Automated video surveillance; Bandwidth estimation; Bandwidth optimization; Simulation framework; Video distortions; Security systems","Alsmirat, M.A.; Department of Computer Science, Jordan University of Science and TechnologyJordan; email: masmirat@just.edu.jo",,"Springer Verlag",18618200,,,,"English","J.

All the necessary information from these two modalities has to be integrated into a single image for better diagnosis and treatment of a patient. Image fusion is a process of combining useful or complementary information from multiple images into a single image. In this article, we present a new weighted average fusion algorithm to fuse MRI and CT images of a brain based on guided image filter and the image statistics. The proposed algorithm is as follows: detail layers are extracted from each source image by using guided image filter. Weights corresponding to each source image are calculated from the detail layers with help of image statistics. Then a weighted average fusion strategy is implemented to integrate source image information into a single image. Fusion performance is assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Proposed method is compared with the traditional and recent image fusion methods.

Normally, the Yagi-Uda antenna radiates in the end fire direction. The proposed antenna is intended to radiate as near as possible to obtain the maximum radiation pattern with low profile and compact size. The reflector is U shaped slot; the driven element (Radiator) is U shaped fold slot while the director is rectangular slot. These slots are printed on a top of very thin FR4 substrate with a dimension of 1.6mm and loss tangent of 0.0018. The radiator will be fed by the Microstrip feed line printed on the bottom of the substrate. A C-band (4-8 GHz) prototype is designed by using Integrated Electromagnetic 3 Dimension (IE3D) Software and to be tested using Network Analyzer. The proposed antenna resonates at multiple frequencies and the maximum gain of above 8 dBi is achieved. The main objective is to optimize the structure of a proposed antenna (interms of length and width), to achieve high gain above 8.0 dBi and directivity above 10.0 dBi and also to operate over a multiple band of microwave frequency which is used for enormous microwave applications. The performance analysis is measured in terms of return loss, bandwidth and VSWR respectively.

Denoising MRI images is an important preprocessing step required in many of the automatic computed aided-diagnosis systems in neuroscience. Rician noise occurs in the MRI image during acquisition. Non local mean filter is used for denoising. But the parameter selection is not optimized. The proposed method removal of rician noise in MRI images using bilateral filter by fuzzy trapezoidal membership function improves the denoising efficiency at various noise variances, preserves the fine structures and edges. The fuzzy weights were obtained with the statistical features such as local mean (μi) and global mean (μg) by constructing trapezoidal membership function. Bilateral filter is used to preserve the edges by smoothening the noises in MRI image and preserves the structural information. Local filter preserves the edges. MRI images are restored by multiplying its corresponding fuzzy weight with the restored image of local order filter and bilateral filter. Experiments on simulated and real MRI data were done at different noise levels by the proposed method and the existing methods. The result shows that the proposed method restores the image in better visual quality and can be well utilized for diagnostic purpose at both low and high densities of rician noise. © 2017 IEEE.","bilateral filter; denoising; fuzzy logic; magnetic resonance imaging; membership function; rician noise","Bandpass filters; Computation theory; Diagnosis; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy logic; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Membership functions; Neurology; Nonlinear filtering; Restoration; Bilateral filters; Computed-aided diagnosis; De-noising; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Non-local mean filters; rician noise; Structural information; Trapezoidal membership functions; Image denoising",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

In place of a randomly estimated model of the plant, a model is determined using recursive least square estimation based on estimated states. The idea of model-based control is to reduce communication frequency, to meet the constraints of available bandwidth. It is noticed that smaller the error between plant and model, higher is the update interval. The model-based approach is applied to a classical problem of an inverted pendulum. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using simulation results. © 2017 IEEE.","Inverted Pendulum; Model-Based Networked Control System; Parameter Estimation","Bandwidth; Control systems; Parameter estimation; Pendulums; Available bandwidth; Communication frequency; Inverted pendulum; Model based approach; Model based controls; Model-based networked control systems; Networked environments; Recursive least square estimations; Networked control systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047086,,,"English","Int.

Direct ONU intercommunication does not impose any extra burden on upstream and downstream bandwidth therefore efficient bandwidth utilization is also increased.

The Flow of duplicacy increases the congestion in the communication directly which tends to extend the overhead of link. Due to congestion, there is the possibility of many attacks during communication which cannot easily discriminate by the node in the network. In this paper, we proposed dependable and continuous arrangement by inserted Bloom-filter in the packet header at the time of packet broadcasting.

The uses of these applications are increasing day by day so it is important to enhance the working quality of such applications. In this paper a novel FSS has been designed based on these applications using FR4 Epoxy substrate having dielectric constant 4.4 and tangent loss 0.025. The designed FSS is working as both bandpass filter resonating at 2.5, 3.5 & 5.5 GHz frequencies and bandstop filter resonating at 3 and 4.3 GHz. In the design of proposed FSS, it consists of three different shape aperture elements which are creviced into metallic sheet placed on dielectric substrate and the 8×8 array has been proposed in the paper. For the whole structure simulation microwave software (CST MW studio and Ansys HFSS electromagnetic software) has been used. In this paper parametric analysis of theta and phi have been also shown which represents polarization performance of the proposed design. The simulated results show that about 95% of power is reflected by the FSS sheet. The proposed filter has advantage of resonating at multiple frequencies, polarization independent & wide in bandwidth. At the end proposed design is also verified in ANSYS HFSS software and the results are slightly varied at higher resonating frequency. © 2017 IEEE.","ANSYS HFSS software; CST MW Studio; FR-4 Epoxy; Transmissive; Tri Application; WiFi; WiMax; WLAN","Application programs; Bandpass filters; Computer software; Dielectric materials; Frequency selective surfaces; Notch filters; Polarization; Studios; Substrates; Wi-Fi; Wimax; Dielectric substrates; Electromagnetic software; HFSS software; MW-studio; Polarization independent; Structure simulations; Transmissive; WLAN; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047086,,,"English","Int.

The simulation results for the RDRA on MBST substrate is compared with those for RDRA on FR4 substrate. Another section of the simulation study includes the effect of composite substrates i.e. FR4-air (FR4C) and MBST-air (MBSTC) substrates on the antenna performance. From the simulation study of these substrate configurations, it was observed that in case of FR4 uniform substrate, impedance bandwidth of 670 MHz was achieved with E-plane radiation pattern beamwidth of 84° and antenna gain of 6.54 dB. While in case of MBST uniform substrate, impedance bandwidth of 680 MHz is achieved along with E-plane radiation pattern beam width of 90° and same antenna gain of 6.54 dB. Thus similar antenna bandwidth and gain is observed with some increase in E-plane beam width in the later case. When the composite substrates are compared, FR4C provides antenna gain of 6.60 dB at its resonating frequency of 9.06 GHz and MBSTC provides little higher gain of 6.63 dB at its resonating frequency of 8.99 GHz. No changes in the resonant frequency and bandwidth are observed for composite FR4C and MBSTC substrates when compared with the corresponding uniform FR4 and MBST substrates respectively. Since, the proposed MBSTC antenna provides similar antenna performance with reduced material and lower cost, it can be an alternative for conventionally available substrates. The simulation study was performed using Ansys HFSS software. © 2017 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Composite substrate; Gain; Glass ceramic; LTCC; RDRA","Bandwidth; Ceramic materials; Computer software; Dielectric devices; Directional patterns (antenna); Electric impedance; Glass; Glass ceramics; Microwave antennas; Natural frequencies; Silica; Titanium dioxide; Antenna performance; Composite substrate; Gain; Impedance bandwidths; LTCC; RDRA; Rectangular dielectric resonator antennas (RDRA); Resonating frequency; Substrates",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047086,,,"English","Int.

These techniques greatly depend on the accurate extraction of transition regions. Transition region extraction becomes difficult when there is grey level overlapping between foreground and background. Further, the performance of these methods deteriorates when the background and foreground are textured or are of varying intensities. Also, these are applied mostly for single object segmentation. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a robust hybrid method for image segmentation containing single and multiple objects. The proposed method uses a two-dimensional Gabor filter which enhances the boundaries of object regions for better extraction of transition regions. These transition regions undergo morphological operations to get the object contours and object regions. Finally, objects are extracted from the object regions.

In our proposed game, at each stage the source node keeps track of the available multiple paths, the residual bandwidth of the paths and the strategy of the attackers from the information gathered during the previous stage. Based on these observations, the source node selects a path for data communication and switching strategy among the multiple established paths between the source node and the destination node. Accordingly, it selects an optimal routing strategy to send data packets to the destination at each stage of the game. Using minimax-Q learning, the selected routing strategy maximizes the expected sum of per stage discounted payoff, which is the utilization of residual bandwidth between a source–destination pair along with the probability that the path is safe.

At the same time, trust management system should not be power killing, complex in terms of computation and processing capability. To convey a noticeable framework, we propose Collaborative Trust based Secure Routing protocol (CTSR) for observing direct and indirect trust values. Here we utilize two-way acknowledgement-based trust framework (2-ACKT) which requires lesser memory resources and minimizes the communication overhead. Our simulation setup for Mobile Adhoc Networks with 2-ACKT framework calculates trust value with both direct and indirect observations based on Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of uncertain reasoning approach respectively. Since the inception of DST for indirect observation in wireless networks trust values are effectively derived with data packets and control packets. The capability of DST to solve the problems with different reliability has flaws in certain areas where the nodes were subjected to disclose critical information like residual energy level and available bandwidth. And also common results derived from DST may lead to uncertain decisions.

In this paper, we present a single image SR (SISR) approach in wavelet domain, which simultaneously preserves the contrast and edge information. Our algorithm uses the notion of geometric duality to generate the initial estimation of unknown high-resolution (HR) image, by applying covariance-based interpolation. State-of-the-art wavelet techniques for SISR provide resolution enhancement by replacing the low-frequency subband with the input low-resolution image. This leads to non-uniform illumination in the super-resolved image. The proposed method exploits singular value decomposition to correct the low-frequency subband, as obtained via stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The modified low-frequency subband and the high-frequency subband images are subjected to Lanczos interpolation. The interpolated subbands are filtered by employing diffusion-based shock filter, which operates in the dual dominant modes. All the filtered subband images are fused to generate the final HR image, by applying inverse SWT. Our experimental analysis has demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in preserving the edges with uniform illumination. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Covariance-based interpolation; Diffusion-based shock filter; Image super-resolution; Singular value decomposition; Stationary wavelet transform","Bandpass filters; Diffusion; Image reconstruction; Inertial confinement fusion; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Optical resolving power; Signal filtering and prediction; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Experimental analysis; Image super resolutions; Low resolution images; Non-uniform illumination; Resolution enhancement; Shock filters; Stationary wavelet transforms; Super-resolution image reconstruction; Singular value decomposition","Suryanarayana, G.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, K L UniversityIndia; email: surya_gunnam@yahoo.co.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020273649

The paper demonstrates that the design of a compact size dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) covering wide range of frequency with multiple modes is possible by selecting the value of p less than 1 (p < 1), where p is number of half-wave variations in the z-direction of TEmnp modes.

Most of the existing routing protocols focus on straight forward hop-count metric and are less adaptable to densely distributed and highly mobile networks. Therefore, Multicast communication with QoS in densely populated highly dynamic network an exciting research challenges. The objective of the present paper is to introduce a QoS aware routing metric that determines a reliable forwarding node based on Link Stability cost Function (LSF). A mesh of Multicast routes between Multicast source and destinations has been established using nodes with a maximum LSF. The principle theme underlying our protocol is optimum contention count that can be estimated with the help of received signal strength. The proposed protocol comprises the following stages:(1) Calculation of Link Stability Factor (2) Determination of maximum LSF value (3) Pruning adjacent nodes (4) Creation of a mesh consisting of more stable forwarding nodes (5) Creation of a mobile network in which no node remains isolated, as well as nodes, face lesser contention. Our proposed protocol has been demonstrated on an existing mesh-based Multicast routing protocols, ODMRP. Simulations are carried out on Exata/Cyber simulator, and obtained results are compared with that of ODMRP. The comparative analysis reveals that our protocol is more efficient in contrast to ODMRP, LSMRP, and MMRNS, regarding performance parameters like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average End-to-End Latency and Average Route Lifetime. Also, we have analyzed the impact of minimum and maximum contention count on PDR and delay. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Contention count; Link stability; Link Stability Factor; MANETs; ODMRP; Periodic packets; QoS; Signal strength","Bandwidth; Internet protocols; Mesh generation; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Network routing; Routing protocols; Stability; Wireless networks; Contention counts; Link stability; MANETs; ODMRP; Periodic packets; Signal strengths; Quality of service","Singal, G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur - 302017, India; email: gauravsingal789@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021117178

FES was applied to the rectus femoris (RF) muscle unilaterally of six able bodied (AB) and one individual with spinal cord injury (SCI). Each trial consisted of three repetitions of ES. We hypothesized that the EMD algorithm provides a suitable platform for decomposing the EMG signal into physically meaningful intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which can be further used to isolate electrical stimulation (ES) artifact. A basic EMD algorithm was used to decompose the EMG signals collected during FES into IMFs for each repetition separately. IMFs most contaminated by ES were identified based on the standard deviation (SD) of each IMF. Each artifact IMF was Notch filtered to filter ES harmonics and added to remaining IMFs containing pure EMG data to get a version of a filtered EMG signal. Of all such versions of filtered signals generated from each artifact IMF, the one with maximum signal to noise ratio (SNR) was chosen as the final output. The validity of the filtered signal was assessed by quantitative metrics, 1) root mean squared error (RMSE) and signal to noise (SNR) ratio values obtained by comparing a clean EMG and EMD-Notch filtered signal from the combination of simulated ES and clean EMG and, 2) using EMG-force correlation analysis on the data collected from AB individuals. Finally, the potential applicability of this algorithm on a neurologically impaired population was shown by applying the algorithm on EMG data collected from an individual with SCI. EMD combined with Notch filtering successfully extracted the EMG signal buried under ES artifact. Filtering performance was validated by smaller RMSE values and greater SNR post filtering. The amplitude values of the filtered EMG signal were seen to be consistent for three repetitions of ES and there was no significant difference among the repetition for all subjects. For the individual with a SCI the algorithm was shown to successfully isolate the underlying bursts of muscle activations during FES. The data driven nature of EMD algorithm and its ability to act as a filter bank at different bandwidths make this method extremely suitable for dissecting ES induced EMG into IMFs. Such IMFs clearly show the presence of ES artifact at different intensities as well as pure artifact free EMG. This allows the application of Notch filters to IMFs containing ES artifact to further isolate the EMG. As a result of such stepwise approach, the extraction of EMG is achieved with minimal data loss. This study provides a unique approach to dissect and interpret the EMG signal during FES applications. © 2017 IEEE.","Artifact removal; electromyogram (EMG) filtering; empirical mode decomposition; functional electrical stimulations","Bandwidth; Electromyography; Functional electric stimulation; Mean square error; Muscle; Notch filters; Population statistics; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Sleep research; Artifact removal; Electromyogram; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Functional electri-cal stimulations; Functional electrical stimulation; Intrinsic Mode functions; Root mean squared errors; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); Biomedical signal processing; adult; algorithm; American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; amplitude modulation; Article; artifact; controlled study; electromyograph; electromyography; electrostimulation; Fourier transformation; frequency; human; human experiment; male; mathematical model; muscle contraction; rectus femoris muscle; signal noise ratio; spinal cord injury; stimulus; waveform; algorithm; artifact; clinical trial; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted therapy; electromyography; electrotherapy; innervation; middle aged; neurophysiological monitoring; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; skeletal muscle; Spinal Cord Injuries; statistical analysis; Adult; Algorithms; Artifacts; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electromyography; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Neurophysiological Monitoring; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Spinal Cord Injuries; Therapy, Computer-Assisted",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15344320,,ITNSB,"27834646","English","IEEE Trans.

DFB decomposition is generally preceded by Laplacian pyramid decomposition, as in contourlet transform, in order to separate the high pass content from an image or a video frame. This leads to redundant representation in the transform domain. In the proposed work, increase in redundancy due to contourlet transform is compensated by the application of DFB decomposition directly to the difference between motion compensated consecutive frames, called residual frames, which capture temporal discontinuities in a video. Low-complexity adaptive rood pattern search scheme is used for motion-estimation and tiled version of set partitioning embedded block coder is proposed which reduces the encoding time. The proposed compression scheme is implemented in CIE La∗b∗ color space to exploit its advantages like; linearity and perceptual uniformity. The proposed low complexity sequential video coding scheme achieves, on an average, 0.71 dB more PSNR than H.264 while requiring up to 17.6% less encoding time compared with the H.264 baseline encoder on standard test video sequences. © 2017 IEEE.","CIE La∗b; contourlet transform; directional filter bank; frame difference; motion compensation; video compression","Bandpass filters; Color; Encoding (symbols); Filter banks; Image coding; Image enhancement; Motion compensation; Motion estimation; Signal encoding; Video signal processing; Adaptive rood pattern search; Contourlet transform; Directional filter bank(DFB); Directional filter banks; Frame differences; Laplacian pyramid decomposition; Redundant representation; Video coding schemes; Image compression","Kahu, S.Y.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Visvesvaraya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: samruddhikahu@students.vnit.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028831568

Hence, resource mapping is required in a WMSN, which is based on user linguistic quality of service (QoS) requirements and available resources to offer better communication services. This paper proposes an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based resource mapping for video communications in WMSNs. Each sensor node is equipped with ANFIS, which employs three inputs (user QoS request, available node energy, and available node bandwidth) to predict the quality of the video output in terms of varying number of frames/second with either fixed or varying resolution. The sensor nodes periodically measure the available node energy and also the bandwidth. The spatial query processing in the proposed resource mapping works as follows. (i) The sink node receives the user query for some event. (ii) The sink node sends the query through an intermediate sensor node(s) and cluster head(s) in the path to an event node. A cluster head-based tree routing algorithm is used for routing. (iii) The query passes through ANFIS of intermediate sensor nodes and cluster heads, where each node predicts the quality of the video output. (iv) The event node chooses the minimum quality among all cluster heads and intermediate nodes in the path and transmits the video output. The work is simulated in different network scenarios to test the performance in terms of predicted frames/second and frame format. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed resource mapping is the first work in the area of sensor networks. The trained ANFIS predicts the output video quality in terms of number of frames/second (or H.264 video format) accurately for the given input. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","ANFIS; fuzzy inference system; query processing; resource management; resource mapping; Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Bandwidth; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Mapping; Multimedia systems; Quality of service; Query languages; Query processing; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; ANFIS; Fuzzy inference systems; Resource management; Resource mapping; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Sensor nodes","Shivappa, N.; JSS Academy of Technical Education, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Uttarahalli-kengeri Main Road, India; email: nageshashiva@gmail.com",,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",03341860,,JISYE,,"English","J Intell Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023161893

Thus, the usage of relay transmission is mainly applicable in enlarging the coverage without need of high transmitter power and attaining spatial diversity by node cooperation. This work is mainly intended on Physical-layer Network Coded (PNC) transmission for a two-way wireless transmission system where two source nodes, A and B, communicate through the aid of relay node using an Amplify and Forward(AF) strategy where the relay oversamples the received signal and subsequently filters before amplification. This study makes use of two, three and four-time slots transmission scenario with filter and without filter at the relay. The simulation results showed that PNC outperformed three time slot (3TS) and four time slot (4TS) transmission scenario in terms of maximum sum rate. To highlight the impact of oversampled filtering we have simulated the three transmission schemes with oversampled filter and the results indicate an increase in maximum sum rate in all the three transmission scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.","Amplify-Forward protocol; Maximum sum-rate; PNC; Sum-BER; Two-way relay channels","Bandpass filters; Communication channels (information theory); Digital filters; Electric power transmission; Embedded systems; Network layers; Signal processing; Wireless networks; Amplify forwards; Amplify-and-forward; Maximum sum rate; Sum-BER; Transmission schemes; Two-way relay channels; Wireless transmission systems; Wireless transmissions; Network coding",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509008933,,,"English","Int.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirements. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antennas with metamaterial on the substrate for UWB application is proposed. Three different dimensions with line feed are analyzed in this paper. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0.

Through this analysis, optimum values of the number of femtocells and bandwidth allocations can be obtained, for the available vacant channels in that location. © 2016 IEEE.","Blocking Probability; Channel Allocation; Femtocell; Interference","Bandwidth; Blocking probability; Femtocell; Wave interference; Available bandwidth; Cellular system; Channel allocation; Femto-cells; Frequency re-use; Macro cells; Operating frequency; Optimum value; Mobile telecommunication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

It is based on storing possible filter partial products in a look-up table (LUT) followed by a shiftaccumulation (SA) unit. Usually, all the address location of LUT need to be re-calculated in every iteration. In this paper, we proposed a new strategy for updating the LUT contents without rotation of addresses in successive iterations. This results in a low complexity implementation with high speed. The proposed technique employs random-access memory (RAM) based LUT for storing offset binary coding (OBC) combinations of input samples and filter weights. The savings achieved are significant due to less routing complexity for large order filter. Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis shows that the proposed design occupies lesser area and consumes lesser power and provides higher throughput as compared to existing schemes. For example, a 32 - taps adaptive filter with the proposed technique occupies almost 20 % less area and achieves 12.63 % clock speedup for 2 - taps sub-filter as compared to the best existing scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed Arithmetic (DA); finite impulse response (FIR); least Mean Square (LMS); look-up table (LUT)","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Impulse response; Iterative methods; Logic Synthesis; Random access storage; Table lookup; VLSI circuits; Distributed arithmetic; Finite-impulse response; Least mean square (LMS); LMS adaptive filters; Look up table; Offset-binary coding (OBC); Random access memory; Successive iteration; Adaptive filtering",,"Reis R.Stan M.Huebner M.Voros N.","IEEE Computer Society",21593469,9781509067626,,,"English","Proc.

We explore a packet data agnostic feature of video flows, namely packet-size, to identify the flows.

The reactive impedance surface (RIS) does not only miniaturize but extensively enhances the bandwidth as well as the radiation characteristics of an antenna. The proposed antenna structure consists of a micro strip antenna fabricated on one side of FR4 substrate and RIS on other side of FR4 substrate. Diminution in antenna size and enhancement in gain of circular polarized antenna by using RIS and 5×5 array of patches fabricated on low cost FR4 substrate is proposed. Gain is enhanced from 8 dB to 14.6 dB when 5×5 array of parasitic patches is fabricated on a FR4 substrate layer. Meta-material are intermittent structures. These have been investigated intensively due to the exacting characteristics of ultra-refraction occurrence and negative permittivity or permeability. The Ansoft HFSS is used for the simulation. A patch antenna is used as the radiation source.

Increasing bandwidth requirement has posed challenge to designers to come-up with solutions which could help network run at desired high speed. Classic CAN (Controller Area Network) was conceptualized with the very same purpose but its limited speed (up to 1Mbps) became unable to serve the automotive network because of its increased appetite for bandwidth. That's where CAN FD (CAN with flexible data rate) took birth. CAN FD improved the classic CAN by incorporating two things: 1. Higher bit rate support 2. Larger payload support. By introducing these two features it was assumed that CAN FD could accommodate bandwidth up to 8Mbps (>> 1Mbps of Classic CAN) but is it really true? This is what this paper is going to answer. The paper talks about the impact of increasing bit rate or payload on overall CAN packet performance. It also throws some light on CAN FD performance with respect to different SOCs. It also describes how any other system level module could be utilized to check the overall performance of CAN FD. © 2017 IEEE.","automotive; CAN; CAN-FD; SoC","Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Control system synthesis; System-on-chip; automotive; Automotive networks; Bandwidth requirement; CAN-FD; Cans (controller area network); High Speed; Payload support; System levels; Finite difference method",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062188,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These techniques allow unlicensed secondary users to access the licensed spectrum without any disturbance. A special antenna is required in Cognitive Radio applications for spectrum sensing and communicating. Wide Band antennas are being considered as the most suitable structures for spectrum sensing applications and are perfectly suitable these environments. In this paper, an attempt is made to present the design of simple patch antenna structures by using circular, semi-circular, Semi-circular triangle shaped, semi-circular crown shaped antennas for achieving the wide band characteristics.

An extended Kalman filter based sensorless method is considered in this work. Computational burden of the full order Kalman filter can be minimized by a reduced order model. In this paper an extended Kalman filter algorithm is implemented using a reduced order discretized state space model which estimates the rotor speed and rotor position from the measured stator currents. The order reduction minimizes the computational time of the filter and also greatly simplifies the tuning of the covariance matrices.

To preserve more edge information Canny Edge extraction operator has been applied to the input image and subbands are interpolated using Lanczos interpolation. The high-frequency sub bands and the input image are passed through Non-Local Mean (NLM) filter to reduce the artifacts generated by DWT.

The proposed method is casted into a variational framework. The introduced filter consists of two terms wherein the first term is a data fidelity term and the second term is a prior function. The first term is obtained by minimizing the negative log likelihood of Rician pdf. Since the solution of the first term is ill-posed in nature and hence a prior function is introduced which is a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion based filter. To balance the trade off between data fidelity term and prior a regularization parameter has been introduced. The performance analysis and comparative study of the proposed method with other standard methods is presented for Brain Web dataset at varying noise levels in terms of PSNR and SSIM. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed method is performing better noise removal in comparison to other methods. © 2016 IEEE.","2D MR images; Nonlinear PDE based filler; Rician noise reduction; Rician's probability distribution function","Bandpass filters; Distribution functions; Economic and social effects; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Noise abatement; Nonlinear filtering; Probability distributions; Comparative studies; MR images; Non linear PDE; Non-linear anisotropic diffusion; Performance analysis; Prior functions; Regularization parameters; Variational framework; Image denoising",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467369848,,,"English","India Int.

For meeting the increased demands, new technologies such as relays in device-to-device communication and small cell access points have been introduced. However, these introductions have opened up security issues in the 5G wireless communication networks. This article focuses on security issues of the 5G wireless communication networks and analyzes the effect of a bandwidth spoofing attack using game theory on the small cell access point in 5G wireless communication network. This article also proposes an adaptive intrusion detection system using a hidden Markov Model for detecting an intrusion on small cell access point in a 5G wireless communication networks.

The arrival rates of connection requests for various services change with time of the day, resulting in non-stationary aggregate traffic load that is mathematically complex to model. We propose a novel approach, by using two techniques of stochastic point processes viz., Product Density and Random Point Processes to model time dependent problems in wireless broadband networks. We classify the problems faced by a wireless broadband service provider into two categories-counting measures and aggregate measures. By counting measures, we mean expected number and fluctuation in (a) number of calls of each traffic type in service at any time of the day (b) number of calls that have completed service in a time interval (c) number of calls that have exceeded a given delay threshold and (d) offered load. We define Product Densities of first order to evaluate the expected value and Product Densities of second order to evaluate the fluctuation of these measures for non-homogeneous Poisson arrival rate and exponential servicing rate. Each of the connection requests arriving at random instants of time triggers a random process of traffic, for a random duration. The cumulative built-up of the triggered random process is non-Markovian and hence, it is mathematically complex to estimate its statistical characteristics. We categorize as aggregate measures, the expected value and fluctuation in (a) aggregate traffic load at the base station from all types of traffic and (b) aggregate resources (or bandwidth) required to service this traffic load. The cumulative built-up of these measures fits in with Random Point Process, a special class of stochastic point processes. We estimate the expected value and fluctuation of aggregate measures for time dependent arrival rates, using Random Point Process and Product Density. © 2017 ACM.","Bandwidth Fluctuation; Non-stationary Traffic; Product Densities; Random Point Processes; Time-dependent Arrival Rate","Aggregates; Bandwidth; Base stations; Complex networks; Random processes; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; Bandwidth fluctuations; Non-stationary traffics; Product density; Random point process; Time-dependent arrival rate; Broadband networks",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450350518,,,"English","DIPWN - Proc.

Firstly, the proposed algorithm employs band pass filter (BPF) and low pass filter (LPF) for the determination of the peak magnitude of fundamental component of load current, Im1. Secondly, BPF and LPF are utilized to process the supply voltage for unit vector template generation (UVT), thereby ensuring effective operation even under nonsinusoidal supply voltage. Lastly, based on Im1 and UVT, the proposed LPF-BPF fundamental current extractor provides instantaneous value of fundamental active component of load current which when drawn from the supply ensures that the source current is sinusoidal and unity power factor (UPF) is maintained at the supply end. The extracted current is further processed to take into account the regulation and balancing of the dc-link voltages. The operation of the 1-phase FL-CHBI based D-STATCOM with the LPF-BPF fundamental current extractor scheme is analyzed for steady state and dynamic operation under non-distorted and distorted supply voltages. The performance analysis reveals IEEE standard-519 compliant operation of the D-STATCOM with proposed extraction scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","Active filters; Distributed static compensator(D-STATCOM); Filters; Multilevel inverter; Power quality","Active filters; Bandpass filters; Bridge circuits; Electric current regulators; Electric inverters; Extraction; Filters (for fluids); Low pass filters; Power quality; Cascaded H-bridge inverters; DSTATCOM; Fundamental component; Multilevel inverter; Non-sinusoidal supply voltage; Performance analysis; Template generation; Unity power factor (UPF); Static synchronous compensators",,"Ramesh P.L.N.Moorthi M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509054343,,,"English","Proc.

The misalignment between the ejected vehicle and the moving platform is computationally estimated and corrected to provide accurate navigation. The estimator has to filter the noisy measurement provided by the navigational sensors mounted in the vehicle to arrive at the mismatch due to misalignment. Due to nonlinear system model, particle filter is designed for the estimation. However, presence of flexure effects in the daughter vehicle gets captured by the sensors and this further complicates the misalignment estimation. By using additional system states for flexure in the system model of the particle filter, the flexure can be estimated and corrected, but this increases the computational complexity. In this work, it is shown both analytically and through simulation that an evolutionary particle filter which evolves through multiple system models can provide at par performance in the steady state with lower computational complexity and better transient response. © 2017 IEEE.","Bayesian estimator; Nonlinear system estimation; Transfer alignment","Bandpass filters; Computational complexity; Monte Carlo methods; Navigation; Nonlinear systems; Vehicles; Bayesian estimators; Misalignment estimation; Navigation in formation; Navigational sensors; Noisy measurements; Nonlinear system modeling; Particle filter design; Transfer alignment; Alignment",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035960,,,"English","I2MTC - IEEE Int.

Classically, CTFM-based sonars and radars use the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) magnitude peaks to find the range of the received echoes. In applications where the medium does not support large signal bandwidth over the ranges of interest, the DFT technique cannot provide the required range resolution. A technique called dual demodulator continuous-time frequency modulation (DDCTFM) was proposed to overcome this limitation and provides greater range resolution. But we observe that there is a problem of phase mismatch in DDCTFM that does not increase the range resolution. This problem is explained in the paper. The super resolution Root-MUSIC algorithm is studied in this context to evaluate its efficacy in providing higher frequency resolution and corresponding range resolution in CTFM. Several detailed simulation experiments done in MATLAB to provide insight into its performance are reported in the paper. Also, lab experiments have been done to practically demonstrate the efficacy of using Root-MUSIC technique in CTFM. Based on the results obtained from the simulation experiments, it is concluded that there is an improvement by a factor of 2.8 in the range resolution estimation by the use of Root-MUSIC algorithm over DFT-based analysis in CTFM. In practical experiments, the improvement factor obtained in the range resolution estimation is 2.35. © 2017 IETE.","CTFM; DDCTFM; Root-MUSIC","Bandwidth; Continuous time systems; Frequency modulation; MATLAB; Modulation; Sonar; Wavelet analysis; Bandwidth limiteds; CTFM; DDCTFM; Higher frequencies; Improvement factors; Range resolution; Root-MUSIC; Super resolution; Discrete Fourier transforms",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03772063,,,,"English","IETE J Res",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013468563

A good quality EEG signal provides the proper interpretation and identification of physiological and pathological phenomena. However, these recordings are often corrupted by different kinds of noise. As Savitzky Golay smoothing filter (SGSF) preserves the peaks and minimize the signal distortion, its use in cascade may further enhance this capability. Therefore in the present work cascaded SGSF (CSGSF) is proposed to filter the noisy EEG signals. The CSGSF combines two successive Savitzky Golay filters. For comparative analysis, other cascaded arrangements like cascaded moving average filter (CMAF), MAF-SGSF, SGSF-Binomial and single stage SGSF are also designed. These filters are tested on artificial EEG signals added with white Gaussian noise and non Gaussian noise. These filters are also tested on real time EEG signals. The filtered signals are assessed through signal to noise ratio (SNR), signal to signal plus noise ratio (SSNR), SNR improvement (SNRI), mean square error (MSE) and correlation coefficient (COR).

Therefore, energy efficient FIR filter will increase lifetime of network and FIR filter with less delay and latency will increase performance of network. In this work, we are going to design an FIR filter that will energy efficient as well as faster than traditional design. Three different FPGA and SOC are taken under consideration and our design is implemented on these four ICs and we find the most energy efficient architecture and also find the architecture that will deliver highest performance among these four architectures taken under consideration. There is 47.74% reduction in latency when we migrate our FIR Filter design from 28 nm process technology based seven series architecture to 20 nm process technology based ultrascale architecture. When we analyze power dissipation of Artix-7, Kintex-7, Zynq and Ultrascale FPGA then we conclude that Zynq 7000 All programmable SOC is power hungry architecture and Kintex ultrascale architecture is the most energy efficient architecture that dissipates 20.86% less power than Zynq 700 All programmable SOC.

Existing WiNoC architectures generally use millimeter-wave antennas without significant directional gains, along with token passing protocol to access the shared wireless medium. This limits the achievable performance benefits since only one wireless pair can communicate at a time. It is also not practical in the immediate future to arbitrarily scale up the number of non-overlapping channels by designing transceivers operating in disjoint frequency bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum commonly adopted for on-chip wireless interconnects. Consequently, we explore the use of directional antennas whereby multiple wireless interconnect pairs can communicate simultaneously. However, concurrent wireless communications can result in interference. This can be minimized in NoC by optimal placement of wireless interfaces (WIs) to maximize performance while minimizing interference. To address this, we propose an interference-aware WIs placement algorithm with routing strategy for WiNoC architecture by incorporating directional planar log-periodic antennas (PLPAs). This directional wireless network-on-chip (DWiNoC) architecture enables point-to-point links between transceivers and hence multiple wireless links can operate at the same time without interference. © 2017 IEEE.","Directional antenna; interference-aware placement; on-chip interconnection networks; wireless network-on-chip","Antenna arrays; Antennas; Computer architecture; Directive antennas; Frequency bands; Integrated circuit interconnects; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Log periodic antennas; Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Network architecture; Radio transceivers; Servers; Transceivers; Wireless interconnects; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Achievable performance; Directional Antenna; Interference-aware; Millimeter wave spectra; Millimeter-wave antennas; Multiple wireless links; On-chip interconnection network; Wireless communications; Network-on-chip",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23327766,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Multicast Routing and Spectrum assignment (MRSA) in Flexible-Grid Optical Networks (alternately Elastic Optical Networks) generates a multicast tree for each multicast session request and spectrum frequency slots are allocated to each of the edge of the multicast tree. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique can be used to implement MRSA algorithm. Spectrum frequency slots are allocated to the edges of the multicast tree obeying the spectrum continuity constraint and spectrum contiguity constraint, thus creating a multicast light-tree. In this paper we have proposed a lighttreesharing based multicast routing and spectrum assignment technique. Similar multicast requests are grouped together and their bandwidth requirements are added up. For each multicast session request a layered auxiliary graph is selected based on available spectrum in the network and the request's bandwidth demand. An efficient light-tree is generated from this auxiliary graph, first for the clubbed request and then for the individual requests separately. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm significantly reduce the average tree size and increases number of requests satisfied than the well-known existing algorithm mentioned in literature. Incidentally the average number of splitters required is also reduced. © 2016 IEEE.","Auxiliary graph; Elastic optical networks; Heuristics; Light-tree; Multicast session","Bandwidth; Fiber optic networks; Forestry; HIgh speed networks; Multicasting; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Routing algorithms; Trees (mathematics); Auxiliary graph; Elastic optical networks; Heuristics; Light tree; Multicast sessions; Network routing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035847,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

CSE algorithm uses binary representation of coefficients for the implementation of higher order FIR filter with a fewer variety of adders than Canonic Signed Digit (CSD)-based CSE methods. According to the VHBCSE Algorithm, initially 2-bit binary common sub-expression elimination algorithm has been applied vertically across adjacent coefficients on the 2-D space of the coefficient matrix followed by applying 4-bit and 8-bit BCSE algorithm horizontally within each coefficient. Thus there is reduced power consumption by minimum switching activity along with an improvement in the area and delay.

In this approach to enhance the Speech content in the Noisy speech signal, Digital audio effects are used. A Digital Expander generates an audio effect which operates on a low signal level and create more likely sound characteristics.

EMG signal has a bandwidth of about 20-500 Hz and overlaps with the ECG frequency range. i.e. 0.05-150 Hz. These interferences occur due to movement of muscles and respiratory actions during ECG recording. Removal of EMG noise from ECG is an important criterion for proper analysis of the signal. In this study, we evaluated the denoising performance of wavelet functions by considering SNR as the quality judgement parameter. DWT provides better denoising over traditional filtering techniques.

Therefore, more sophisticated techniques are required to combat with network congestion. Various constrained resources of the WSN are to be taken into account while devising such mechanisms. Different approaches for congestion detection and avoidance have been introduced in the past few years. The traditional flooding and gossiping algorithm can cause loss of data. To tackle some of the issues, this paper presents a novel approach for congestion control based dynamic routing. In the proposed work, whenever the packet traversal experiences the congestion, an alternate path is computed to reroute the packets on the new path. The proposed work has three phases namely congestion detection, alternate path computation and re-routing the packets on new path. Congestion in the path can be detected based on the free space available in the buffer. Alternate path is computed based on available bandwidth, hop distance and residual energy on the path. This work is simulated using C for its effectiveness. Some of the performance parameters considered in this work are route discovery time, congestion ratio, delay etc. © 2016 IEEE.","Alternate path computation; Congestion Control; Wireless sensor network","Bandwidth; Congestion control (communication); Embedded systems; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Alternate path; Area of interest; Available bandwidth; Congestion detection; Constrained resources; Network congestions; Performance parameters; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

The voltage level of ECG signal ranges from as low as 0.5 to 5mV and frequency components fall into the range of 0.05 to 100Hz. Various noises like Power Line Interference (PLI), baseline wander and noise due to muscles contraction and relaxation get added into the recorded ECG signal. Out of them, PLI is considered to be the major source of noise. PLI may be stationary or non stationary. Non adaptive filters are employed to remove stationary power line interference and adaptive cancellers are used to handle non-stationary power line interference. In this paper adaptive LMS algorithm along with Kalman filtering became KLMS has been investigated to eliminate PLI from contaminated ECG signal. The results of KLMS filter has been compared with the LMS filter before and after filtering the ECG signal.

The use of stethoscope for diagnosing abnormalities has many limitations which overcome with the use of digital signal processing technique.

Design technique of bandpass filter is proposed using various type of window function Hanning, Hamming, Blackman and Kaiser window. Fast forier transform is plotted to observe the frequency distribution o f a signal and which is useful for the computation of Power spectral density graph. Power spectral density graph is plotted to obeserve the frequency at maximum peak value of the waveform and the maximum frequency is calculated.

Antennas employed in such systems have certain requirements: High gain, stable and omni-directional radiation pattern, reduced interference. This paper presents a compact dual band monopole antenna suitable for 2.4/5 GHz WLAN application. The antenna is fabricated on an FR4 substrate of size 20 × 30 × 0.8 mm3 and consists of multiple meandering lines connected to the 50-Ohm microstrip feed signal line to generate the desired dual resonance frequencies. Two impedance bandwidths, for S11≤-10 dB, of 240 MHz and 2570 MHz have been obtained from simulation results which show that the required bandwidths of IEEE 802.11b/g (2.4-2.485 GHz) and IEEE 802.11a (5.15-5.825 GHz) can be completely covered by the proposed antenna. Prototype of the proposed antenna shows good agreement between simulated and measured results.

Most power systems can accommodate a certain level of harmonic but we have problems when harmonics become an indicative component of overall load. As these higher frequency harmonics flow through the power system affects the communication, overheating and hardware damage such as overheating of electrical equipment, cables, transformers, generators. High voltages and circulating currents caused by harmonic resonance. Hence for the detection of these harmonics current total harmonic distortion the use of the passive power filter, active power filter and hybrid power filter. Then, as an investigation this paper extends the existing comparisons found in with a proposed simulation study. The study isolates the harmonic detection method from the active filter and out places the input waveform from the sensors with a known waveform, artificially constructed. Thus, the output waveform that should be expectable now is noted and differentiates between each analyzed harmonic detection method. Traditionally passive power filter was used as a solution for this problem, caused by the system harmonics, since they are easy to design, having simple structure low cost, high efficiency, lower voltage regulation and phase advanced synchronous capacitors etc. However traditionally controllers have many drawbacks. Which provides only fixed compensation, generates resonance problem and are bulky in size. To overcome these problems active power filter are introduced satisfy for the current harmonics and to minimize the THD. This project the comparisons will be found with a proposed simulation gives separation of the harmonic identified method from the active filter and replaces the input signal from the detector with a familiar signal, Also find the output signal that should be predictable now is noted and differentiate between each estimated harmonic detection schemes. This project the most relevant results of the simulations. And finally compare their results with DFT analysis methods with PI controller d-q reference frame in SAPF. © 2016 IEEE.","Active filter; Harmonic Detection techniques; Harmonics; passive filter; SAPF","Active filters; Bandpass filters; Controllers; Design for testability; Harmonic analysis; Signal processing; Voltage regulators; Electrical equipment; Harmonic detection; Harmonics; Higher-frequency harmonics; Hybrid power filter; Passive power filters; SAPF; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Passive filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509004676,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In fixed-value impulse noise, the gray value is a fixed value, i.e., either 0 or 255 (example: Salt and pepper noise). Digital signal processing frequently involves some method for noise reduction over an image. The median filter is a non-linear digital filter, which is most popularly used to remove impulse noises. Many popular algorithms were presented which eliminates impulse noises present and maintains the fine details of the image. But, median filter fails to preserves the edges of the image by uniform modification of the noise affected pixels and the noise-free pixels. Also, the conventional filters work better only over images affected with low noise ratios and is very poor when the noise ratio reaches above 40%. The proposed de-noising algorithm uses an adaptive Gaussian filters for removal of salt and pepper noise. As conventional de-noising algorithm fails at high noise density and in preserving edges along with image details the proposed technique switches between mask sizes depending noise density. To preserve edges and details of the image Adaptive threshold is employed. Advantage of adaptive threshold filtering does not affect the edges or other small structures in the image. Hence this method is more efficient for the images with very high noise ratio and preserving edges. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive Gaussian filters; Salt and Pepper noise; System generator; Xilinx ISE","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gaussian distribution; Image acquisition; Image processing; Impulse noise; Integrated circuit design; Median filters; Optimization; Pixels; Pulse shaping circuits; Salt removal; Signal processing; Adaptive threshold filtering; De-noising algorithm; Design and implementations; Fixed-value impulse noise; Gaussian filters; Salt-and-pepper noise; System Generator; Xilinx ISE; Edge detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046973,,,"English","Int.

There are various algorithms to find the optimal value in a digital transmission system. But among them, the evolutionary variable step size of Least Mean Square algorithm (EVSSLMS) is inspired by the 'competitive methods' from the online learning literature. The predicated approaches improve the convergence performance of adaptive algorithms through variable step size functions.

Reuse of partial results eliminates the necessity of matrix resizing in interpolation filter computation. A novel block-formulation is presented to share the partial results for parallel computation of filter outputs of different up-sampling factors. Using the proposed block formulation, a parallel multiplier-based reconfigurable architecture is derived for interpolation filter. The aspect of the proposed architecture is that, it does not require reconfiguration to compute filter outputs of an interpolation filter for different up-sampling factor. The proposed structure has regular data-flow and it has no overhead complexity for its reconfigurable feature unlike the existing structures. Besides, the proposed structure has significantly less register complexity than the existing structure and its register complexity is independent of the block-size. Moreover, the proposed structure can support higher input-sampling frequency than the existing structure. ASIC synthesis result shows that the proposed structure for block-size 4, filter length 32, and up-sampling factor 8, involves 13.6 times more area and offers 245 times higher maximum input-sampling frequency compared with the existing multiplier-less structure. It involves 18.6 times less area-delay-product (ADP) and 9.5 times less energy per output (EPO) than the existing multiplier-less structure. © 2016 IEEE.","Coefficient decimation method; FIR channel filter; Low complexity; Re-configurability","Bandpass filters; Embedded systems; Frequency multiplying circuits; Interpolation; Reconfigurable architectures; Signal filtering and prediction; Signal processing; Signal sampling; Configurability; Decimation method; FIR channel; Interpolation filters; Low complexity; Parallel multipliers; Proposed architectures; Redundant computation; FIR filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

The proposed microstrip patch antenna has been designed using flexible FR-4 having dielectric constant (&amp;Jukcy;r) of 4.4 and thickness of 1.5mm with slotted patch on the top of substrate and a reduced ground at its lower side. The radiating patch and conducting ground are made of copper material having thickness 17 microns. The ground plane has been defected and reduced so as to escalate the antenna performance in terms of bandwidth and return loss. The feed line has to be of appropriate width so as to match the antenna impedance with port impedance of 50 ohms for maximum power transfer with minimal reflections. The performance of proposed antenna is analyzed in terms of return loss (dB), directivity (dBi), gain (dB), smith chart and VSWR. The antenna has a gain of 2.474 dB and directivity of 1.957 dBi at resonant frequency of 790 MHz. The antenna has VSWR less than 2 in the operating frequency range (761 MHz to 966 MHz). The antenna has been designed and simulated using CST Microwave Studio 2014. The antenna has been fabricated and tested for experimental validation using Network Analyzer E5071C and anechoic chamber.

In sharp contrast to digital technology where Moore's law reigns, a fundamental law of physics constrains the ability to realize electrically small antennas that are both efficient and broadband. Software defined radio is defined as a radio in which some or all of their functions are software defined. The use of SDRs to make communications has enabled the design of intelligent radios called as Cognitive radio(CRs), by making communications re-configurable at lower layers of the networking stack. The major challenge is to design small antennas which can be operated at the large number of frequency bands. By tuning/switching the resonant frequency, single antenna can operate at different band of frequencies.

This paper shows the design technique, parametric analysis, and simulated and fabricated results of parallel coupled transmission line filter operating at 2 GHz, the most used frequency in wireless systems. Microstrip and Stripline technologies are very common for implementation of bandpass and bandstop filters with required bandwidth up to a 20% with reference to central frequency. Design equations for calculation of coupled line parameters namely, space gap between lines, line widths and lengths are carried out so that analysis and numerical realization of the filter at 2 GHz could be approximated for microwave applications. For analysis, design, modelling and iterative simulations, the electrical specifications were determined as centre frequency of 2 GHz, bandwidth of 400 MHz, minimum attenuation of -20 dB and bandpass ripple of 0.5 dB. The dielectric material chosen to be used for this filter is FR4 having dielectric constant of 4.4 at this operating frequency and bandwidth. Scattering parameters S11 and S12 found after simulations of this filter in CST Microwave Studio are -34 dB and -1.54 dB respectively. The simulated results after insertion of rods inside the filter are achieved as -43 dB for S11 and -1.40 for S12. These results are verified with the measured results for the fabricated parallel coupled Microstrip band pass filter.

The problem escalates in the presence of mixed traffic with different priorities. Thus, minimizing jitter for video in presence of voice in the uplink is an issue.

DASH uses a rate adaptation algorithm to adapt the bitrate played continuously based on the network conditions. Most of the algorithms use buffer occupancy, throughput, or a combination thereof to adapt the bitrate. In the literature, the Quality of Experience (QoE) of users is measured objectively using metrics such as, number of interruptions and their duration, average bitrate played, and the number of bitrate switches. In this work, we propose a score-based approach to assess the user experience of different rate adaptation algorithms objectively. We experimented with five algorithms implemented using an HTML5 player under varying bandwidth and network conditions. Our results demonstrate that algorithms considering both measured bandwidth and playback buffer occupancy lead to better QoE even under low bandwidth conditions. We show that buffer-based algorithms do not work well in networks with low bandwidth. Algorithms that only try to improve the bitrate played often end up with more interruptions or bitrate switches when bandwidth fluctuates. Due to the mutual dependency among the objective metrics, most of the algorithms do not necessarily improve overall QoE while selecting appropriate bitrate. © 2016 IEEE.",,"HTTP; Quality of service; Video streaming; Adaptation algorithms; Buffer occupancy; Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP; Mutual dependencies; Network condition; Objective metrics; Objective qualities; Quality of experience (QoE); Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The storage services of cloud environment are replacing the traditional Content Delivery Networks for more reliability and easy availability of contents to users. Most research in Content Delivery Networks mainly focuses on delivering contents to the users with less latency and traffic cost. Apart from this the overall cost incurred for the content providers in cases of bandwidth and storage should also be taken into consideration. Most existing Content Delivery Networks focus only on the bandwidth and in some cases latency. In this paper a novel Content Delivery Model is proposed that makes use of a Genetic Optimization Algorithm (GOA) combined with an efficient storage model that can achieve better content placement and delivery in Cloud based Content Delivery Networks. The proposed approach updates itself dynamically to avoid unwanted use of storage that achieves a much better placement of contents thus reducing the storage cost. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Content Delivery Network; Genetic Algorithm; Optimization","Bandwidth; Cloud computing; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud environments; Content delivery; Content delivery network; Content providers; Genetic optimization algorithm; Storage costs; Storage services; Distributed computer systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The antenna realizes complete azimuthal beam scanning with a maximum elevation angle of 34°. This antenna consists of a central driven element and four hexagonal slotted tunable parasitic patches placed on each side of the driven element. The effective electrical size of the parasitic element is changed with respect to the driven element, by varying the capacitance of varactor diodes loaded in the hexagonal slot. The reflector and director properties of the tunable parasitic elements are used to tilt the main beam of antenna away from the broadside direction. The antenna achieves continuous beam scanning from θ = 0° to 34° for π = 45°, 90°, 135°, 225°, 270° and 315° planes. The advantage of the antenna is that the design is simple and it maintains a common impedance bandwidth from 2.42-2.47 GHz in all configurations.

A major problem faced by the rescue workers during post disaster scenario is the frequent communication disruption from the conventional networks (like cellular), and therefore information collection and coordination among different parties get affected. To meet the coordination requirements of victims as well as rescue team members, we need to provide continuous, effective and reliable communication channels. Therefore, there is a requirement to build an alternate ad hoc network infrastructure that is efficient, robust and scalable in information exchange with minimum setup time and within cost constraints. In this paper, we consider a three-tier network architecture to support above mentioned challenges and focus on providing efficient information transfer with minimum data loss and compliance to network constraints. It provides end-to-end connectivity between workers/volunteers and control station, that requires large amount of packet exchange. It can be noted that this alternate network is primarily developed for information collection from the affected regions, and therefore, based on the information availability at different regions, there is a requirement to redistribute network resources like bandwidth, delay constraints etc. As a consequence, we need an adaptive and efficiently redistribution of network resources for ensuring service quality. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for efficient routing over the proposed alternate communication infrastructure, considering redistribution of resources and dynamic bandwidth utilization based on information availability at different disaster affected regions. The proposed network architecture along with the resource redistribution algorithm is implemented over ONE network simulator framework, and the performance of the scheme is analyzed and compared with other state-of-the-art mechanisms for challenged networks. © 2016 IEEE.","Bandwidth allocation; Delay tolerant network; Post disaster network communication","Bandwidth; Delay tolerant networks; Disasters; Frequency allocation; Human resource management; Quality control; Quality of service; Ad hoc network infrastructure; Communication infrastructure; Disaster-affected regions; End-to-end connectivity; Information availability; Information collections; Post disasters; Resource redistribution; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

We have developed a QoS framework that leverages SDN capabilities to achieve optimal throughputs for all QoS flows on a congested network. Specifically, we propose an approach that reassigns bandwidth unused by one or more flows to other flows in priority order, while simultaneously ensuring that QoS flows can reclaim their reassigned bandwidth whenever they are able to use that bandwidth. At the heart of our framework is the Adaptive Quality of Service (AQoS) algorithm, inspired by Integrated Services (IntServ) principles, which enables fine-tuned, real-time control over per-flow bandwidth allocations, combined with classic Differentiated Services (DiffServ) priority classes that determine how bandwidth is distributed. We evaluate and compare the results of the AQoS throughput optimizations to those achieved by several baseline algorithms common to both classic and SDN networks, with promising results. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Data transfer; Optimization; Quality control; Real time control; Routers; Adaptive quality of services; Differentiated Services; Network technologies; Optimal throughputs; Research communities; Software defined networking (SDN); Throughput optimization; Traffic Engineering; Quality of service",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

It is estimated that this fraction will cross 80% in the next three years. Most popular VoD services have recommendation engines which recommend videos to users based on their viewing history, thus introducing time-correlation in user requests. Understanding and modeling this time-correlation in user requests is critical for network traffic engineering. The primary goal of this work is to use empirically observed properties of user requests to model the effect of recommendation engines on request patterns in VoD services. We propose a Markovian request model to capture the time-correlation in user requests and show that our model is consistent with the observations of existing empirical studies. Most large-scale VoD services deliver content to users via a distributed network of servers as serving users requests via geographically co-located servers reduces latency and network bandwidth consumption. The content replication policy, i.e., determining which contents to cache on the servers is a key resource allocation problem for VoD services. Recent studies show that low start-up delay is a key Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of users of VoD services. This motivates the need to pre-fetch (fetch before contents are requested) and cache content likely to be requested in the near future. Since pre-fetching leads to an increase in the network bandwidth usage, we use our Markovian model to explore the trade-offs and feasibility of implementing recommendation based pre-fetching. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Engines; Markov processes; Quality of service; Recommender systems; Telecommunication traffic; Content replication; Distributed networks; Empirical studies; Internet traffic; Network bandwidth; Network traffic engineering; Time correlations; Video on demand services; Video on demand",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

One of the most important factors that diminish the quality of viewing experience of delivered videos is frequent client side rebuffering events. This paper proposes a buffer-aware downlink scheduling framework (called BA-TLS) for streaming video applications. The problem of scheduling a set of video streams over LTE has first been formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. It has been shown that a conventional dynamic programming solution for the ILP imposes prohibitive online overheads. Then, by utilizing analytical properties of the problem, a genetic algorithm based fast and efficient radio resource allocation heuristic has been implemented over the proposed framework. Experimental results reveal that the developed framework is able to provide significant reductions in rebuffering events and thus allow video transmission with high and acceptable quality of service. © 2017 IEEE.","Buffer Awareness; Genetic Algorithm; Low Overhead Scheduling; LTE; Radio Resource Allocation; Video Streaming","Bandwidth; Dynamic programming; Genetic algorithms; Image communication systems; Integer programming; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Video streaming; Analytical properties; Buffer Awareness; Future wireless networks; Integer Linear Programming; Low overhead; Multimedia applications; Programming solutions; Radio resource allocation; Wireless telecommunication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

Each SU is allowed to place multiple bids-each bid is a tuple consisting of amount of bandwidth requested and the corresponding price the SU is willing to pay for that bandwidth. The bids from a SU follow a typical demand curve which we model using the Sigmoid function. Once all bids are placed, the PU determines the winner set such that: i) mutually interfering SUs are not allocated the same channel and ii) a channel can be sold multiple times as long as the corresponding SUs do not interfere with each other. Instead of using the 'unit price' which is a commonly used heuristic for ordering the bids from a bidder, we use an exponentially scaled version of the unit price which we term as the normalized bid price. The average normalized bid price is used for ordering the bidders. The proposed auction scheme takes O(nlogn) time while improving the spectrum reuse and generating close to maximum revenue. We validate the proposed allocation process through simulation experiments and show what fraction of secondary users get the bandwidth and how many times the bandwidth is reused. We also show that the proposed heuristic abides by the economic properties of auctions. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Costs; Allocation process; Dynamic spectrum access networks; Maximum revenue; Secondary users; Sigmoid function; Spectrum auctions; Spectrum reuse; Spectrum-allocation scheme; Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

The proposed methodologies also classify healthy subjects, arrhythmic and ischemic patients. The idea is to extract the QRS-ST-T features; where, QT interval and 99% occupied bandwidth (Hz) features are extracted from QT complex and QRS versus ST-T interval ratio (%) is also formulated after segmenting the QT complex into QRS complex and ST-T segment by localizing the inflection points. The evaluation of this proposed approach has been carried out using the selected 36 recordings (true positive (TP) beats) from each standard databases i.e., MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, FANTASIA and European ST-T database. The method is initiated with the preprocessing stage and then the inflection points (i.e., (Formula presented.) are detected using Pan-Tompkins method and curve analysis techniques. Then the time-frequency domain features (e.g. QT interval (s) and 99% occupied bandwidth (Hz)) are extracted from the segmented mean QT complex and the QRS versus ST-T interval (%) ratio is extracted from the segmented mean QRS versus ST-T segments simultaneously. These features are introduced to the classifier like decision tree, support vector machine and K-means for clustering operation. The classification success rate is 97.03% and resubstitution error rate is 2.97% among the arrhythmia, ischemia and healthy classes using QT interval and QRS versus ST-T interval ratio (%) features. The evaluations of other features are also analyzed along with graphical classification results. Allied evaluation of segments belonging to ventricular depolarization (QRS complex) and repolarization (ST segment and T wave) i.e., QT complex, will certainly improve the detection probability of ischemia and arrhythmia with further correlative parametric features. This also leads to automatic detection and classification of arrhythmia and ischemia by avoiding visual inspection and error free decison making. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Arrhythmia; Decision tree; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Ischemia; K-means clustering; Support vector machine (SVM)","Bandwidth; Database systems; Decision trees; Electrocardiography; Frequency domain analysis; Support vector machines; Arrhythmia; Classification and clustering; Classification results; Clustering operation; Detection probabilities; Ischemia; K-means clustering; Time frequency domain; Diseases","Bhoi, A.K.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology (SMIT), Sikkim Manipal UniversityIndia; email: akash730@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020410572

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirement. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. This paper presents pentagon shape patch antenna with probe feed for three different dimensions. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0.

Using PO device, required medical data is acquired using the photoplethysmographic (PPG) data utilizing PPG sensors attached on forehead/ to finger/at earlobe of the patient and then Ratio parameter (R) is computed pertaining to amplitudes of acquired red and IR PPG signals. Further, 'R' is used to estimate oxygen saturation levels with the help of calibration curve. Subject movements while recording the medical data may result in erroneous estimation of required estimation parameter and in turn may result in wrong diagnosis by the clinician. Reduction of Motion Artifacts (MA) component from raw PPG data recorded may guarantee error-free measurement of oxygen blood saturation level (SpO2). MA's can be removed from raw PPG signal (corrupted) using band pass filtering method, but the persisting in-band noise component cannot be removed. In this paper, authors propose a filtering method using tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to remove MA components. Advantage of TQWT sytems from the fact that, the realization of practical narrow band pass filter with a specific Q-factor value can be designed, which motivated the authors to use for this application. Experimental results have shown a good acceptance for the proposed method as the MA reduced PPG signals obtained are having efficient morphological features. SpO2 is estimated from MA reduced PPGs by utilizing the calibration curve. The superiority of proposed technique has been proved by comparing the experimental results with results obtained using basic least mean squares (LMS) method. Signal data can be acquired with different MA components (bending, horizontal and vertical movements of patient's finger) is considered for experiment analysis. Obtained SpO2 parameter calculations proved the efficacy of estimation technique in measurement of reliable and accurate SpO2, helpful for medical diagnosis. © 2017 IEEE.","Motion Artifacts (MA); Photoplethysmographic signals (PPG); Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT)","Bandpass filters; Biomedical signal processing; Blood; Calibration; Diagnosis; Intensive care units; Least squares approximations; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Oxygen; Photoplethysmography; Q factor measurement; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Error-free measurements; Least mean squares methods; Morphological features; Motion artifact; Narrow-band pass filters; Oxygen saturation levels; Photoplethysmographic signals; Q-factors; Parameter estimation","Ashoka Reddy, K.; Dept. of ECE, KITSIndia; email: reddy.ashok@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037155,,,"English","Int.

There are various indexing schemes available for this purpose. Access time and Tuning time are two main parameters for evaluating the performance of these indexing schemes. Among different indexing schemes, Hashing scheme gives better results in terms of access time and tuning time. This paper studies, analyzes and compares all the existing Hash-based indexing schemes over wireless data broadcasting environment. Based on the performance of different hashing schemes in different wireless environment, we can choose one of them for disseminating the information. © 2016 IEEE.","Access latency; Hashing schemes; Mobile computing; Tuning time; Wireless data broadcast","Bandwidth; Electric batteries; Indexing (of information); Information dissemination; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Tuning; Access latency; Broadcasting data; Hashing schemes; Indexing techniques; Public information; Tuning time; Wireless data broadcast; Wireless environment; Broadcasting",,"Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034116,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

This paper is an extension of our previously proposed features (used in relatively best performing SSD system) at the first ASVspoof 2015 challenge held at INTERSPEECH 2015. For the challenge, the authors proposed novel features based on cochlear filter cepstral coefficients (CFCC) and instantaneous frequency (IF), i.e., CFCCIF. The basic motivation behind this is that human ear processes speech in subbands. The envelope of each subband and its IF is important for perception of speech. In addition, the transient information also adds to the perceptual information that is captured. We observed that subband energy variations across CFCCIFwhen estimated by symmetric difference (CFCCIFS) gave better discriminative properties than CFCCIF. The features are extracted at frame level and the Gaussian mixture model based classification system was used. Experiments were conducted on ASVspoof 2015 challenge database with MFCC, CFCC, CFCCIF, and CFCCIFS features. On the evaluation dataset, after scorelevel fusion with MFCC, the CFCCIFS features gave an overall equal error rate (EER) of 1.45% as compared to 1.87% and 1.61% with CFCCIF and CFCC, respectively. In addition to detecting the known and unknown attacks, intensive experiments have been conducted to study the effectiveness of the features under the condition that either only SS or only VC speech is available for training. It was observed that when only VC speech is used in training, both VC, as well as SS, can be detected. However, when only SS is used in training,VCspeech was not detected. In general, amongst vocoderbased spoofs, it was observed thatVCspeech is relatively difficult to detect than SS by the SSD system.

These special methods are designed to provide the necessary security and privacy privileges to the registered users of the biometric system. Similar to other security domains, these schemes require to follow certain properties or characteristics like unlinkability, irreversibility and low information leakage from the stored data. Ideally, these schemes must not result in any degradation of the biometric recognition performance as a whole. Designing a system which balances all these factors efficiently has been a major challenge. Contemporary frameworks generally relax one or more of these parameters in order to achieve their application specific goals. However recently, a modified Bloom filter based scheme was proposed which apparently provided competent security measures in addition to high recognition accuracy rates. However subsequent studies refuted the security guarantees of the scheme by providing adversarial attacks with practical bounds. In our work, we address this issue and propose a modified Bloom filter based framework which provides all the desirable security measures of a biometric template protection scheme. Not only have we theoretically proved all the security notions of our model, but also experimentally verified our claims. Thus our proposed design provides satisfactory security guarantees in addition to the implicit advantages of using Bloom filters like speed and efficiency. Finally, there is no reduction in the performance rates of the underlying system since we perform the matching of the biometric traits in their original forms (in contrast to some transformed space). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biometrics; Bloom filters; Iris; Perfect secrecy; Security","Bandpass filters; Data structures; Biometric recognition; Biometric recognition system; Biometric template protections; Bloom filters; Iris; Modified bloom filters; Perfect secrecy; Security; Biometrics","Sadhya, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University)India; email: debanjan.sadhya@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",01674048,,CPSED,,"English","Comput Secur",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014526012

To diminish spectrum sensing data falsification attacks, we exploit hamming algorithm to expel forgery node from spectrum sensing decision. Furthermore, the primary radio network channel allocation algorithm is employed to precisely deliver the video with high quality and lower delay. For video transmission in a cognitive radio network, we compress the video frames using block truncation coding-pattern fitting in order to reduce bandwidth requirement. This compression technique offers good video transmission with a high compression ratio in a cognitive radio network, due to trade-off among quality, bit rate and decoding time.

This study proposes a fully backward compatible novel method for bandwidth extension (BWE) of NB speech. The method uses integer wavelet transform technique to provide a perceptually better wideband (WB) speech signal. The spectral envelope parameters are extracted from the down sampled frequency shifted version of the high-frequency components of speech signal existing above NB, which are spread by using pseudo-noise codes, and are embedded in the integer wavelet coefficients of NB speech signal. The hearing threshold is calculated in the integer wavelet domain and this threshold is employed as the embedding threshold. The embedded information is extracted at the receiving end to reconstruct the WB speech signal. Theoretical and simulation analyses show that the proposed method is robust to quantisation and channel noises. The comparison category rating listening and log spectral distortion tests clearly show that the reconstructed WB signal gives a much better performance in terms of speech quality when compared with some of the existing speech BWE methods employing data hiding. © 2017.

This interaction is an attribute of natural speech and is rarely present in synthetic or voice-converted speech. Therefore, we propose features based on the S-F interaction for a spoofed speech detection (SSD) task. To that effect, we estimate the voice excitation source (i.e., differenced glottal flow waveform, g?(t)) and model it using the well-known Liljencrants-Fant model to get coarse structure, gc (t). The residue or difference, gr (t), between g?(t) and gc (t) is known to capture the nonlinear S-F interaction. In the time domain, the L2 norm of gr (t) in the closed, open, and return phases of the glottis are considered as features. In the frequency domain, the Mel representation of gr (t) showed significant contribution in the SSD task. The proposed features are evaluated on the first ASVspoof 2015 challenge database using a Gaussian mixture model based classification system. On the evaluation set, for vocoder-based spoofs (i.e., S1-S9), the score-level fusion of residual energy features, Mel representation of the residual signal, and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features gave an equal error rate (EER) of 0.017%, which is much less than the 0.319% obtained with MFCC alone. Furthermore, the residues of the spectrogram( aswell as theMel-warped spectrogram) of estimated g?(t) and gc (t) are also explored as features for the SSD task. The features are evaluated for robustness in the presence of additive white, babble, and car noise at various signal-to-noise-ratio levels on the ASVspoof 2015 database and for channel mismatch condition on the Blizzard Challenge 2012 dataset. For both cases, the proposed features gave significantly less EER than that obtained by MFCC on the evaluation set. © 2017 IEEE.","Anti-spoofing; Gaussian mixture model; LFmodel; Residue; Source-filter interaction","Bandpass filters; Classification (of information); Gaussian distribution; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrographs; Speech; Storms; Anti-spoofing; Gaussian Mixture Model; LF model; Residue; Source filters; Speech recognition",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19324553,,,,"English","IEEE J.

The sound pressure level changes in universal environment with reverberation due to external noise and linguistic effect in turn affects the speech perception. The external noise such as wind, impulse and background noise reduce with existing hearing aid filter. The linguistic effect such as syllable, phonemic, long distance co articulation and vocal effects needs a filter based on the frequency and magnitude of the effects, to deliver the sound with clarity and natural sound.

The FRR filter bank consists of dyadic wavelet, RLS, ISTFT, 1-D Lifting wavelet filters.

CR network senses the unused frequency bands of the primary users (PUs) and assign them to the unlicensed secondary users (SUs). One of the major challenges in cognitive network is the allocation of available spectrum which indirectly contributes to the efficient spectrum utilization. A novel intelligent dynamic spectrum allocation with bandwidth flexibility is presented in this paper. Fuzzy inference system has been used to evaluate and rate the channel (CH) quality and the SU. The quality based spectrum allocation has been carried out. As the primary CH bandwidth differ from the SU and in the case, the SU bandwidth is lower to PU, accommodation of more than one secondary CH into primary is possible. To utilize this facility, bandwidth flexibility is incorporated in the intelligent spectrum allocation. The intelligent spectrum allocation techniques are compared with the sequence based method of spectrum allocation and priority based allocation. The quality measures utilized for comparison are service rate, average packet loss and average delay. On these measures intelligent dynamic bandwidth flexible spectrum allocation method is found to be better, compared to other three methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bandwidth flexibility; Cognitive radio; Fuzzy; Intelligent allocation; Priority; Round robin; Spectrum allocation","Bandwidth; Frequency bands; Fuzzy inference; Routers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Fuzzy; Intelligent allocation; Priority; Round Robin; Spectrum allocation; Cognitive radio","Veeramakali, T.; Faculty of I&C, Adhiparasakthi Engineering CollegeIndia; email: umaprabhu81@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018492313

To endow with first-rate network access to the consumers of a PON system have to utilize a competent bandwidth distribution algorithm, which allot the accessible bandwidth dynamically to the users based on their requirement. This paper proposes a framework and details of a scheduling method based on Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation which meets the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for differentiated data services in PON networks. The performance of an Optical Line Terminal and Optical Network Units (ONU) can be analysed which explains the QoS of a PON network. For achieving higher bandwidth usage, the proposed method discards leftover unutilized slots through dynamic queue threshold method. This results in accurate bandwidth allocation to each ONU.

Variations in the recording devices, environmental conditions, and the presence of vocalizations from other animals make the bird sound detection very challenging. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised algorithm comprising two main stages. In the first stage, a spectrogram enhancement technique is proposed using a multiple window Savitzky-Golay (MWSG) filter. We show that the spectrogram estimate using MWSG filter is unbiased and has lower variance compared with its single window counterpart. It is known that bird sounds are highly structured in the time-frequency (T-F) plane. We exploit these cues of prominence of T-F activity in specific directions from the enhanced spectrogram, in the second stage of the proposed method, for bird sound detection. In this regard, we use a set of four moving average filters that when applied to the enhanced spectrogram, yield directional spectrograms that capture the direction specific information. We propose a thresholding scheme on the time varying energy profile computed from each of these directional spectrograms to obtain frame-level binary decisions of bird sound activity. These individual decisions are then combined to obtain the final decision. Experiments are performed with three different datasets, with varying recording and noise conditions. Frame level F-score is used as the evaluation metric for bird sound detection. We find that the proposed method, on average, achieves higher F-score (10.24% relative) compared to the best of the six baseline schemes considered in this work. © 2017 IEEE.","Bioacoustic monitoring; bird sound detection; directional spectrograms; Savitzky-Golay filter","Bandpass filters; Passive filters; Spectrographs; Environmental conditions; Evaluation metrics; Moving average filter; Savitzky-Golay filter; Sound detection; Specific information; Spectrograms; Unsupervised algorithms; Birds","Meenakshi, G.N.; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: gnisha@ee.iisc.ernet.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23299290,,,,"English","IEEE ACM Trans.

A hybrid heuristic search technique having differential evolution (DE) method as a global search technique and binary successive approximation based evolutionary search method as a local search technique has been proposed.

The state-of-the-art approach for the design and selection of Gabor filter banks is based on a trial and error. This results in more computational complexity and higher response time. To overcome this problem, an attempt is made to design a single optimized Gabor filter instead of a filter bank for feature extraction. This approach improves the filter performance by significantly reducing the computational complexity and response time. The hybrid particle swarm optimization-gravitational search algorithm (PSO-GSA) is used for optimizing the parameters of the single Gabor filter. In this context, an evolutionary single Gabor kernel (ESGK) based filter approach is proposed for face recognition. The proposed method is used to extract Gabor energy feature vectors from face images. We also propose a new eigenvalue based classification approach for face recognition. This approach is derived from sparse based representation methods. The novelty in our paper is measurement of sparsity of the weighting coefficients of each training sample. The main contribution of the paper is two-fold. Firstly, investigation of ESGK approach, which is not found in the literature. Secondly, introducing a new eigen value based classifier. FERET, ORL, UMIST, GT and LFW databases are used to measure the efficiency of our proposed method. The results are compared with a holistic Gabor filter bank based recognition methods.

The problem of frame packing for CAN-FD, as studied in the literature, assumes a single sub-system where one CAN-FD bus serves as the communication medium among several Electronic Control Units (ECUs). Modern automotive electronic systems, on the other hand, consist of several sub-systems, each facilitating a certain functional domain such as powertrain, chassis and suspension. A substantial fraction of all signals is exchanged across sub-systems. In this work, we study the frame packing problem for CAN-FD with multiple sub-systems, and propose a two-stage optimization framework. In the first stage, we pack the signals into frames with the objective of minimizing the bandwidth utilization. In the second stage, we extend Audsley's algorithm to assign priorities/identifiers to the frames. In case the resulting solution is not schedulable, our framework provides a potential repacking method. We propose two solution approaches: (a) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation that provides an optimal solution but is computationally expensive for industrial-size problems; and (b) a greedy heuristic that scales well and provides solutions that are comparable to optimal solutions. Experimental results show the efficiency of our optimization framework in achieving feasible solutions with low bandwidth utilization. The results also show a significant improvement over the case when there is no cross-domain consideration (as in prior work). © Prachi Joshi, Haibo Zeng, Unmesh D. Bordoloi, Soheil Samii, S.S.

We introduce a novel hierarchical data structure called BloomSampleTree that helps us design efficient algorithms to extract an almost uniform sample from the set stored in a Bloom filter and also allows us to reconstruct the set efficiently. In the case where the hash functions used in the Bloom filter implementation are partially invertible, in the sense that it is easy to calculate the set of elements that map to a particular hash value, we propose a second, more space-efficient method called HashInvert for the reconstruction. We study the properties of these two methods both analytically as well as experimentally. We provide bounds on run times for both methods and sample quality for the BloomSampleTree based algorithm, and show through an extensive experimental evaluation that our methods are efficient and effective. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bandpass filters; Hash functions; Bloom filters; Experimental evaluation; Hash value; Hierarchical data structure; Sample quality; Sampling and reconstruction; Show through; Space efficient; Data structures",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10844627,9781509065431,,,"English","Proc Int Conf Data Eng",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021251025

As microstrip patch antenna is a high Q structure, thereby narrow bandwidth, resistive loading (introducing lossy lumped element inside the antenna structure) is considered as potential technique for improving bandwidth. Instead of conventional resistive loading i.e placing resistance of desired value across the substrate an alternative technique of resistive loading is proposed. Here resistances are connected across the slots of microstrip patch antenna. This method of resistive loading is easy and controllable. Resistive loading is performed on a dual slot rectangular microstrip patch antenna. Behavior of the loaded structure for different resistance values and different slot positions has been studied. A significant improvement in the bandwidth of slotted microstrip patch antenna has been achieved at the expense of gain. This antenna is designed to operate in the frequency range of (2.4/2.5GHz) which partially covers WiFi and WiMax frequency range. © 2016 IEEE.","bandwidth; controllable resistive loading; dual slot; Microstrip patch antenna","Antennas; Bandwidth; Microstrip antennas; Microstrip devices; Microwave antennas; Slot antennas; Antenna structures; Controllable bandwidths; Dual slots; Micro-strip patch antennas; Potential techniques; Rectangular microstrip patch; Resistive loading; Slotted microstrip patches; Loading","Roy, S.S.; National Remote Sensing CentreIndia",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509038879,,,"English","Proc.

The proposed antenna is fabricated on a RT/duroid 5880 substrate with a dielectric constant (ϵr) of 2.2 and thickness (h) of 0.787mm. Slots are etched on one side of the substrate, while the microstrip feed network is printed on the other side.

While small on-die caches have been effective so far in hiding this bottleneck, the ever-increasing footprint of modern applications renders such caches ineffective. Recent advances in memory technologies like embedded DRAM (eDRAM) and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) have enabled the integration of large memories on the CPU package as an additional source of bandwidth other than the DDR main memory. Because of limited capacity, these memories are typically implemented as a memory-side cache. Driven by traditional wisdom, many of the optimizations that target improving system performance have been tried to maximize the hit rate of the memory-side cache. A higher hit rate enables better utilization of the cache, and is therefore believed to result in higher performance. In this paper, we challenge this traditional wisdom and present DAP, a Dynamic Access Partitioning algorithm that sacrifices cache hit rates to exploit under-utilized bandwidth available at main memory. DAP achieves a near-optimal bandwidth partitioning between the memory-side cache and main memory by using a light-weight learning mechanism that needs just sixteen bytes of additional hardware. Simulation results show a 13% average performance gain when DAP is implemented on top of a die-stacked memory-side DRAM cache. We also show that DAP delivers large performance benefits across different implementations, bandwidth points, and capacity points of the memory-side cache, making it a valuable addition to any current or future systems based on multiple heterogeneous bandwidth sources beyond the on-chip SRAM cache hierarchy. © 2017 IEEE.","access partitioning; DRAM cache; memory system bandwidth","Bandwidth; Computer architecture; Dynamic random access storage; Memory architecture; Static random access storage; Supercomputers; access partitioning; Improving systems; Learning mechanism; Memory systems; Modern applications; Partitioning algorithms; Performance benefits; Performance bottlenecks; Cache memory",,,"IEEE Computer Society",15300897,9781509049851,,,"English","Proc.

Cat swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm is applied to improve the null performance of TMLDAAs by radio frequency switch. The nulls at the particular positions of the direction of arrival of a TMLDAA can be reduced effectively by the proper optimization of current excitation weights and an effective design of switch-on time intervals of each element. CSO gives the optimized value of the current excitation weights of the radiation pattern. The optimized results obtained by CSO algorithm using MATLAB simulation are practically implemented and are designed through computer simulation technology–microwave studio simulation software for half-wave dipole antenna arrays. The dipole antenna is designed to operate at a resonant frequency of 2 GHz.

The documents stored in cloud are of huge size and due to its sensitivity arises security and storage problems. Data is stored on remote location in cloud and cryptographic techniques resolve problems of data security. To ensure data to be secure in cloud, the client encrypts data and then stores on cloud by employing Hyper Elliptic Curve cryptography (HECC). Search over encrypted data makes the process of file retrieval from cloud more difficult. The paper proposes architecture of multiple keyword search by building index using Bloom filter and also pair key generation by false random bit generator. Bloom filter takes constant time for searching O (N) on large encrypted file systems without the need of document decryption thereby speeding up the process of ciphertext retrieval on user side. Bit array representing keyword information is only stored by data owner on cloud where the server is unable to find file content or query information. The experimental results show that Bloom filter based indexing is faster than traditional indexing schemes, the multiple keyword based search algorithm is effective in case of the response time of query and scalability of the system in case of size of data.","Bloom filter; False random bit generation; HECC; Secure index","Bandpass filters; Cryptography; Data structures; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Indexing (of information); Number theory; Public key cryptography; Bloom filters; Cryptographic techniques; Encrypted File System; HECC; Hyper-elliptic curves; Random bit generations; Random bit generators; Secure index; Search engines","Thiyagarajan, D.; School of Computing Science and Engineering, VIT University, Chennai Campus, Vandalur - Kelambakkam Road, India; email: devi.t2013@vit.ac.in",,"Femto Technique Co., Ltd.",1816353X,,,,"English","Int.

Its communications embrace all possible technologies to ensure that it is properly delivered to the intended destination/person. The technologies, military adopts are huge and intricate. It progressed to visual and audible signals, and then advanced into the electronic age. Military transmits messages such as orders and reports, both in the field and at sea and between headquarters and distant installations or ships. Most of the orders and reports are scanned copy. The security are to be beefed up and technology designers have been at their best to develop technologies to boost reliability, to ensure authenticity and imbibe more and more security, taking into considerations of available bandwidth. Notwithstanding the development and implementation of technologies, hackers are at their best to defeat the technologies. The sharing of digital images, involving orders, reports and sensitive information are becoming increasingly difficult to prevent unauthorized access and to avoid data forgery. The very danger of unauthorized access and its blatant use against national security is imminent. If any third party gets the secret message, they can alter the contents and transfer this to destination. The secrecy of the digital images will be lost due to this unauthorized access. So military images should maintain the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity. For this, military communication should ensure the use of efficient and robust cryptographic techniques.

Then, this unitary evolution is used to obtained the approximate evolution of the system state by tracing out over the bath space.

Present hearing aid devices amplify the speech signal which is corrupted by disturbances and noise from the same environment, resulting degraded speech quality and less efficiency of such devices. Application of wiener algorithm in HA device provides improved speech quality with less complexity. Noticeably enhanced speech quality can be obtained if multiple wiener filter channels are used. Multichannel wiener filter algorithm for speech considers scalar combination of noise inputs to filter and speech correlations. A single target speech system having multiple noise inputs to the filter is designed for estimation of degrading signal or noise. It allows extraction of pure speech by nullifying the estimated noise from corrupted speech of the pilot channel.

The proposed filter uses a tapered via transition to provide a smooth transition from microstrip line (planar structure) to SIW (waveguide structure) with minimal reflection which results in better S11 performance and wider bandwidth.

The operation of the FPIM with distributed winding requires the elimination of third-harmonic voltage, which, if not taken care of, would generate distorted stator current. For this, the concept of virtual vectors (VVs) is utilized. Before selecting the VVs for the DTC operation, a theoretical analysis is carried out to find the effects of these VVs on the torque and flux response of the FPIM under different speed and loading conditions. It is found that the rotor speed plays a crucial role in the selection of VVs. A particular VV has different effects on the torque change as speed varies. This analysis helps in the selection of VVs, hysteresis torque bandwidth, flux bandwidth, and efficient formation of sectors. Furthermore, in this paper, the performance of the FPIM during low-speed operation is improved by avoiding the demagnetization of the stator flux. To achieve this, a new modified lookup table is proposed. Superiority of the proposed method over the reported approaches is illustrated by experimental results. © 2017 IEEE.","Direct torque control (DTC); five-phase induction motor (FPIM); hysteresis bandwidth; multiphase induction motor; virtual vector (VV)","AC motors; Bandwidth; Hysteresis; Speed; Stators; Table lookup; Torque; Torque control; Direct torque control; Five-phase induction motors; Hysteresis bandwidth; Multi-phase induction motors; virtual vector (VV); Induction motors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",02780046,,ITIED,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Electron",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018984092

Gateway (GW) relocation of Access Service Network (ASN) includes changing the Anchor Point (AP) of Mobile station (MS) from one GW of an ASN to another GW of different ASN which is not affected on Traffic's Link Layer (LL) handover. As per existing standards defined by IEE 802.16, when this GW relocation from one ASN to other ASN to be performed is not specified, but have information about the GW relocation procedures based on different call admission control algorithms. In this paper, Bandwidth based call Admission Control (BAC) algorithm is proposed that focuses on requested size from MS instead of the number of MSs arriving in ASN.

This paper proposes a fully backward compatible novel method for bandwidth extension of NB speech. The method uses magnitude spectrum data hiding technique to provide a perceptually better wideband speech signal. Code excited linear prediction (CELP) parameters are extracted from the down sampled frequency shifted version of the high frequency components of speech signal existing above NB, which are spread by using pseudo-noise codes, and are embedded in the low-amplitude high-frequency regions of the magnitude spectrum of NB speech signal. The embedded information is extracted at the receiving end to reconstruct the wideband speech signal. Theoretical and simulation analyses show that the proposed method is robust to quantization and channel noises. The log spectral distortion test clearly show that the reconstructed wideband signal gives a much better performance in terms of speech quality when compared to some of the existing speech bandwidth extension methods employing data hiding. © 2016 IEEE.","CELP; Magnitude spectrum data hiding; Speech bandwidth extension; Speech quality; Spread spectrum","Bandwidth; Speech; Speech intelligibility; Steganography; Bandwidth extension; CELP; Data hiding; Speech quality; Spread spectra; Speech communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509013388,,,"English","Int.

Removal of unwanted and rebound of sound from speech signal is must to enhance the clarity of the voice in such interactions. A novel frequency domain adaptive algorithm to eliminate rebound sound effect in speech signal inside an auditorium is presented here. The forgetting Factor (λ) on which steadiness of adaptive algorithm depends is kept constant in the suggested RLS algorithm. To enhance the computational power and confluence rate, a frequency domain dynamic filter algorithm is often utilized in abolishment of acoustic feedback. However, the correct step size is always an adjustment between the confluence rate and the stable-state performance. To solve this problem, Nitsch adapted a varying step-size procedure, where the step size is modified by spectral confluence state. A novel methodology to estimate the optimal step size is the subject of this paper. In addition, an artificial delay is inserted in the way of signal to estimate the time-domain system mismatch. Both flat stable-state misadjustment and quick confluence are achieved by the designed algorithm. Simulation results exhibit the effectiveness and the sturdiness of the designed method. At last, MATLAB is used to execute suggested algorithm and the experimentation outcomes demonstrated that the suggested average RLS and optimal step size is compared. © 2016 IEEE.","acoustic feedback cancellation; adaptive filter; ARLS algorithm; Fourier Transform; frequency domain; reverberation; RLS algorithm","Acoustic fields; Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive filtering; Bandpass filters; Echo suppression; Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Human computer interaction; MATLAB; Reverberation; Speech communication; Time domain analysis; Acoustic feedback cancellations; Computational power; Frequency domain adaptive algorithms; Frequency domains; Frequency-domain adaptive filters; Prediction error method; RLS algorithms; Time domain systems; Adaptive filters",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

Video on demand is the current demand from everyone and which is in a high rise and the mobile operators are in a plan of migrating their current IP based infrastructure of LTE to attain new business in the market, online gaming, radio broadcast, webcast, live streaming apps, file sharing are the other services. Many mobile users wanted to have TV support on their mobiles to watch movies, promos and so on. A set of first solutions to this requirement was Media FLO, DVB-H/DVB-T, ISDB-T etc. So from user point of view, it was very good since they can have both mobile phone and TV on a single device with a small extra cost. But for the service provider's point of view, it is not that simple story. Mobile phone network and mobile TV network is totally different and separate, so it is big investment to deploy the network for mobile TV. In view, we can have another simple and powerful broadcasting mechanism for radio broadcast globally. The expected demand is only met when the current serving infrastructure is upgraded. To achieve this one possible solution would be LTE cell transmission with eMBMS. Using this the available bandwidth can be effectively utilized and required content can be delivered with an optimized eMBMS. Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a bi-directional and IP based service which is best used when serving such kind of services. Commercial systems need to be installed to effectively cater the needs. The main objective of the proposed solution is to address the future needs with few key optimizations. The main objective is to optimize the MCE scheduling algorithm using evolved Round Robin technique is to serve more contents to users with optimized radio resource allocation in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.","Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS); evolved Round Robin Algorithm (eRR); Long term Evolution (LTE); MBMS Coordination Entity (MCE); Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)","Bandwidth; Broadcasting; Cellular telephones; Digital multimedia broadcasting; Digital television; Digital video broadcasting (DVB); Distributed computer systems; Economics; Electronic document exchange; Internet protocols; Investments; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Multimedia services; Optimization; Radio broadcasting; Routers; Scheduling algorithms; Telephone sets; Video on demand; Video streaming; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadcast and multicast; Broadcasting mechanism; MBMS Coordination Entity (MCE); Multimedia broadcast multicast services; Radio resource allocation; Round Robin algorithms; Round-robin scheduling; Single frequency networks; Long Term Evolution (LTE)",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

Different transition techniques have been proposed from the far to enable the smooth interoperation between the two protocols: Dual Stack, Tunneling, and Header Translation. Tunneling is the generally used solution to carry an IPv6 packet across the IPv4 network. Tunneling comes with several imperfections like inefficient routing, header overhead due to multiple headers present, Quality of service and high band width usage. These overheads could degrade the network performance especially over wireless links where there is scarcity of resources. In this paper we are addressing the header overhead issue in context of IPv6 tunnels, where the IPv6 header of 40 bytes is encapsulated inside an IPv4 header of length 20 bytes. This overhead would affect the network performance, especially over low bandwidth links, where resource is a constraint. So, it's better to compress this header and then send it over link and decompress it at the other end of the link. In this paper we have proposed a new approach to compress the IPv6 header of the packet, in context of IPv6 tunnels, which would improve the efficiency of IPv6 tunneling mechanism. Doing this we have compressed the 40 bytes of IPv6 header up to 6 bytes. We have applied this compression over multihop wired and wireless tunnels. Extensive amount of simulations are provided to compare the newly developed protocol with the standard tunneling technique. Results show that using this approach we are getting better network deliverables in terms of throughput, average end-to-end delay, Jitter, and Packet delivery ratio. © 2016 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Compression; Context; Decompression; Multihop tunnel","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Compaction; Environmental protection; Network performance; Quality of service; Average end-to-end delays; Context; Decompression; Low-bandwidth links; Multihop; Next generation Internet; Packet delivery ratio; Tunneling mechanism; Internet protocols",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043590,,,"English","Proc.

The detection precision is directly related to the number of subbands (granularity) in the filter bank. This implies that the computational complexity becomes high if the number of stages and granularity of the filter bank structure are increased. The novelty of the proposed method is the estimation of center frequency with higher precision and reduced computational complexity using the centroid method. The merit of the centroid method is that the presence of WM can be detected along with estimation of center frequency in the first stage, if the WM lies partly in one subband and partly in the adjacent subband. This single-stage detection and estimation of WM significantly reduces computational and hardware complexities as well as latency. However, if the WM appears anywhere exclusively within a single subband, the detection process can be completed in the second stage without ambiguity. A mathematical expression for calculating the center frequency of WM from the subband energy (power) using centroid method is also derived and presented. The proposed scheme is analyzed and validated through extensive simulations for the detection of WM. The error in estimation of center frequency in most of the cases is less than 4 % for SNR variations from 0 to −20 dB. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy detection; Filter bank; Polyphase structure; Spectrum sensing; Wireless microphone","Bandpass filters; Cognitive radio; Computational complexity; Estimation; Filter banks; Microphones; Signal to noise ratio; Detection and estimation; Energy detection; Filter bank structures; Mathematical expressions; Polyphase filter banks; Polyphase structures; Spectrum sensing; Wireless Microphone; Frequency estimation","Samuel, C.P.; Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: chrisprema@iist.ac.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014020166

Owing to this property, PFs have been extensively used for object tracking in recent years. Although PFs provide a robust object tracking framework, they suffer from shortcomings. Particle degeneracy and particle impoverishment brought by the resampling step result in abysmal construction of posterior probability density function (PDF) of the state. To overcome these problems, this work amalgamates two characteristics of population-based heuristic optimisation algorithms: Exploration and exploitation with PF implementing dynamic resampling method. The aim of optimisation is to distribute particles in high-likelihood area according to the cognitive effect and improve quality of particles, while the objective of dynamic resampling is to maintain diversity in the particle set. This work uses very efficient spider monkey optimisation to achieve this. Furthermore, to test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, experiments were carried out on one-dimensional state estimation problem, bearing only tracking problem, standard videos and synthesised videos. Metrics obtained show that the proposed algorithm outplays simple PF, particle swarm optimisation based PF, and cuckoo search based PF, and effectively handles different challenges inherent in object tracking. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.",,"Bandpass filters; Distributed computer systems; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Monte Carlo methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Probability density function; Signal filtering and prediction; State space methods; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Bearing only tracking; Exploration and exploitation; Non-Gaussian systems; Particle filters (PFs); Particle swarm optimisation; Posterior probability; Sequential Monte Carlo methods; State - space models; Optimization","Rohilia, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication, Delhi Technological University, Bawana Road, India; email: rajesh@dce.ac.in",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17519632,,,,"English","IET Comput.

In order to get high IRR with low power consumption a novel architecture of GmC complex filter has been proposed with the combination of first order left shifting and right shifting notch filters. The filter is designed in 180 nm CMOS technology and it has a power consumption of 580 μW from 1.8 V supply voltage. This novel approach can be used for multiband multi standard wireless receiver applications, because this filter can be tuned to operate in different frequency bands with different centre frequencies like bluetooth, UMTS, WLAN, GPS etc. In this paper the complex filter for bluetooth applications with a bandwidth of 2 MHz has designed and results are compared with the previous filter topology. The proposed filter achieves around 51 dB image rejection ratio at the center frequency of 4 MHz with using just a third order filter. The power consumed by the proposed filter is 52% less than the existing topology. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Complex filter; GmC; Image frequency; Image rejection ratio (IRR); Low power; Multi standard receiver","Bandpass filters; Bluetooth; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric power utilization; Frequency bands; Integrated circuit design; Topology; Complex filters; Image frequency; Image rejection ratios; Low Power; Multi standard; Notch filters","Reddy, B.N.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: naresh.klu@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09251030,,AICPE,,"English","Analog Integr Circuits Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981244447

ALO is a nature-inspired, population-based, gradient-free meta-heuristic algorithm. It works based on the interaction between antlions and ants and uses Roulette wheel for selection of fitter antlions for catching ants. During the iterative process of optimization, performance of best antlion in each iteration is compared with elite antlion which ensured an optimum solution. To demonstrate the filter modeling efficacy of ALO, four IIR benchmark systems of different orders have been considered for equal and reduced ordered identifications. Modeling performance has been assessed using mean square error (MSE) between the actual and identified model performances, mean square deviation (MSD) between actual and identified IIR filter coefficients and rate of convergence. ALO outperformed the other two recent meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA), recently used for filter modeling. To further assess the robustness of obtained solutions, fifty independent identification trials were conducted and MSE and MSD values were analyzed statistically for standard deviations and means in addition to the statistical t test on MSE values. ALO offered the least standard deviations indicating the robust solutions. Further, in t test, higher positive t values again indicated the significant superiority of ALO over CSA and GSA for IIR filter modeling. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant lion optimizer; Cuckoo search algorithm; Gravitational search algorithm; Heuristic optimization algorithms; IIR filter modeling; System identification","Approximation theory; Bandpass filters; Heuristic algorithms; Identification (control systems); Impulse response; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Optimization; Statistics; Cuckoo search algorithms; Filter model; Gravitational search algorithms; Heuristic optimization algorithms; Optimizers; IIR filters","Nair, S.S.; Division of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Sector-3, Dwarka, India; email: sreejith336@gmail.com",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014053921

In this context, this work introduces and addresses some aspects of a fundamental question: can a spatial field be estimated from samples taken at unknown sampling locations? In a field (signal) sampling setup, unknown sampling locations, sample quantization, unknown bandwidth of the field, and presence of measurement-noise present difficulties in the process of field estimation. In this work, except for quantization, the other three issues will be tackled together in a mobile-sampling framework. Spatially bandlimited fields are considered. It is assumed that measurement-noise affected field samples are collected on spatial locations obtained from an unknown renewal process. That is, the samples are obtained on locations obtained from a renewal process, but the sampling locations and the renewal process distribution are unknown. In this challenging unknown sampling location setup, it is shown that the mean-squared error in field estimation decreases as O(1/n) where n is the average number of samples collected by the mobile sensor. The average number of samples collected is determined by the inter-sample spacing distribution in the renewal process. An algorithm to ascertain spatial field's bandwidth is detailed, which works with high probability as the average number of samples n increases. This algorithm works in the same setup, i.e., in the presence of measurement-noise and unknown sampling locations. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Additive white noise; nonuniform sampling; signal reconstruction; signal sampling; wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth; Location; Mean square error; Quantization (signal); Signal reconstruction; Spurious signal noise; White noise; Wireless sensor networks; Additive white noise; Bandlimited fields; Field estimations; Mean squared error; Measurement Noise; Nonuniform sampling; Presence of measurement noise; Spacing distribution; Signal sampling","Kumar, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: animesh@ee.iitb.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189448,,IETTA,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Link stability metric is used to improve network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, data success delivery ratio (DSDR) and available route time (ART). Energy consumption, bandwidth and communication delay of major concern in ad hoc networks. A high mobility of MANET nodes reduces the reliability of network communication. In a dynamic networks, high mobility of the nodes makes it very difficult to predict the dynamic routing topology and hence cause route/link failures. Multicast in MANETs is an emerging trend that effectively improves the performance while lowering the energy consumption and bandwidth usage. Multicast routing protocol transmits a packet to multicast a group at a given time instant to achieve a better utilization of resources. In this paper, node mobility is considered to map better their movement in the network. So, the links with long active duration time can be identified as a stable link for route construction. Variation in signal strength is used to identify whether the direction of the node is towards or away from estimating node. We consider signal strength as QoS metric to calculate link stability for route construction. Efforts are made to identify the link with highly probable longer lifetime as the best suitable link between two consecutive nodes. We predict the movement time of nodes that define the route path to the node destination. Exata/cyber simulator is used for network simulation. The simulation results of the proposed routing protocol are compared with on-demand multicast routing protocol and E-ODMRP, which works on minimum hop count path. Analysis of our simulation results has shown improvement of various routing performance metrics such as DSDR, ART, routing overhead and packet drop ratio. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Link stability; MANETs; Mobility prediction; Multicast routing protocol; Node mobility; ODMRP; QoS; Routing; SINR","Ad hoc networks; Arts computing; Bandwidth; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Signal interference; Spurious signal noise; Stability; Telecommunication networks; Link stability; MANETs; Mobility predictions; Multicast routing protocol; Node mobility; ODMRP; Routing; SINR; Mobile ad hoc networks","Singal, G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: gauravsingal789@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953387263

The proposed method aims to tune the Kalman filter gain in order to offset the bias that is inherent when estimating speech parameters from noise-corrupted speech. After analysing the Kalman recursion equations and the filter gain, the sensitivity metric was shown to be useful in tuning the Kalman filter to achieve better noise reduction. Speech enhancement experiments were performed on the commonly available NOIZEUS database corrupted with white Gaussian noise, and the proposed method was evaluated and compared with recent speech enhancement methods, such as the STSA estimator with wavelet thresholding on multi-tapered spectra (or STSA-WT) and generalised subspace method. The proposed method was shown to produce better quality speech than the STSA-WT estimator, while being competitive with the generalised subspace method. Spectrogram analysis demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve similar levels of noise reduction to the Kalman filter in the oracle case. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Kalman filter; Noise reduction; Sensitivity metric; Speech enhancement","Bandpass filters; Estimation; Gaussian noise (electronic); Kalman filters; Noise abatement; Speech; Kalman filtering algorithms; Recursion equations; Sensitivity metric; Sensitivity tuning; Speech enhancement methods; Sub-space methods; Wavelet thresholding; White Gaussian Noise; Speech enhancement","So, S.; Signal Processing Laboratory, Griffith School of Engineering, Griffith UniversityAustralia; email: s.so@griffith.edu.au",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014036247

One of the main problems addressed is the development of navigation particle filters that can deal with the scarcity of landmarks and the terrain ambiguity that characterize vast regions of the ocean floor. As a contribution to solve this problem, the paper proposes three novel particle filter algorithms and assesses their estimation efficiency and robustness to non-informative measurements using two well-known benchmarking tests. The performance of the new filters in these tests demonstrates their potential to solve a class of nonlinear problems that include, but are not limited to, the type of underwater navigation problem that motivated the present work. Our study concludes by examining the performance of the filters in terms of determining the position and velocity of an autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of unknown ocean currents. When applied to terrain-aided navigation, the novel particle filter formulations formulations mitigate filter divergence issues frequently caused by terrain symmetries and are more robust than other well-known versions when used in scenarios with poor terrain information. The theoretical developments presented and the results obtained in simulations are validated using real data acquired during tests with an autonomous marine robot.

A 5-stage two parallel bi-functional trapezoidal systolic array architecture based on modified Faddeev algorithm (MFA) is chosen as basic functional block of DKF. Two parallel sets of MFA unit are utilized to increase the throughput by 1.6×, reduce the latency by 1.8× while trading off an increased utilization. In addition, the boundary cell of MFA is modified by replacing the divider unit with a highly pipelined two stage Lookup table based Newton Raphson divider.

For instance, the hardware complexity can be lowered down by α.N, whereas the critical path can be reduced by TA + TM, with α, N, TA and TM being the number of reduced hardware elements, number of filter taps, adder and multiplexer computational delays, respectively.

We consider a scenario in which multiple primaries own bandwidth in a large region (e.g., a state), which is divided into smaller locations (e.g., towns). A primary that has unused bandwidth in a time slot would like to lease it out to secondaries at a set of mutually non-interfering locations in return for a fee. This results in price competition among the primaries. In prior work, this price competition has only been studied under the approximation, made for analytical tractability, that the price of each primary takes values from a continuous set. However, in practice, the set of available prices is discrete. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental question of how the behaviour of the players involved in the price competition changes when this continuity assumption is removed. Our analysis reveals several important differences between the games with continuous and discrete price sets. For example, in the game at a single location, no pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) exists in the game with continuous price sets, whereas a pure strategy NE may exist in the game with discrete price sets. Also, multiple symmetric NE exist in the game with discrete price sets in contrast to the game with continuous price sets, where a unique NE exists. However, we show that as the number of available prices becomes large in the discrete prices game, the strategies of the primaries under every symmetric NE converge to the unique NE strategy of the game with continuous price sets. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Competition; Location; Analytical tractability; Dynamic spectrum access; Price competition; Primary Users; Pure strategy nash equilibriums; Secondary users; Single location; Spectrum markets; Costs",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15502252,9781509017010,IVTCD,,"English","IEEE Veh Technol Conf",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016945550

Hence, image enhancement becomes an important step to improve the quality of image. Images are enhanced such that there is change in intensity or saturation component, keeping hue unchanged. Often, gamut problem arises when transforming from one plane to another. In this paper, the technique focusses on enhancing the contrast of low illumination images while at the same time maintaining the brightness. A function called exposure, is used in estimation of underexposed and highly underexposed images. The brightness of the input image is increased using transformation functions, which is then treated as target image so that the brightness of input image is adjusted close to target image, using histogram matching. The existing technique Exposure based Sub Image Histogram Equalization (ESIHE), is used to increase the visual quality, which is followed by guided image filter for edge smoothening.

This is required in order to attain the essential characteristics from the image. Segmentation finds its applications in different fields of satellite imagery, weather forecasting, traffic controlling etc. But it is mainly used in the medical field to diagnose different kinds of diseases suffered by different people. Though manual segmentation provides with good results but automated analysis of retinal images is more promising as it reduces time and effort required by the experts. Diabetic Retinopathy is such a disorder of an eye which can be mostly seen in a person suffering from diabetes. If this disease is not recognized earlier the person may suffer from complete blindness. Although various techniques have been proposed to detect the blood vessels and diagnose the disorders but the main issue of noise has not been considered greatly. In this paper, a hybrid combination of two filters is proposed which provides us with better results over the existing methods even in the case when the colored retina image is more hampered by noise.

In flooding, each node forwards flood packets to its neighbors so as to ensure that the packets reach the intended destination. Forwarding of redundant flood packets create extra overhead on network bandwidth. However, only a subset of nodes need to forward the packet to make it reach its destination. Clustering has been proven as an efficient mechanism to reduce flooding overhead in MANETs. Active Clustering algorithms use explicit control packets to create and maintain clusters whereas passive clustering piggybacks the control information in the outgoing data packets thus significantly reducing control overhead. The proposed algorithm integrates Passive Clustering with DSR routing protocol. Route Discovery phase of DSR floods the Route Request packets in the entire network. However, the proposed algorithm creates the clusters in the network in the initial phase of Route Discovery process and once the clusters are formed only a subset of nodes will forward the Route Request packets. This approach reduces the overhead on bandwidth by curtailing the flooding of packets and thereby increasing the packet delivery ratio. The simulation results show that optimized DSR algorithm enhances the packet delivery ratio by minimum of 20% and reduces the RREQ flooding by a minimum of 30%. © 2016 IEEE.","DSR; MANETs; Passive Clustering; Qualnet","Bandwidth; Cost reduction; Floods; Intelligent systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Optimization; Routing protocols; Control information; MANETs; Network bandwidth; Packet delivery ratio; Passive clustering; Qualnet; Route discovery process; Route request packets; Clustering algorithms",,"Chaturvedi A.Shukla A.Deolia V.K.Sau P.C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032105,,,"English","Int.

In a simple hearing aid gain is applied to the whole input frequency range, due to which the intensities of some speech sounds after amplification will be larger than the discomfort thresholds. To solve this problem a highly reconfigurable non-uniform digital FIR filter bank structure is proposed, where the whole frequency range is divided into several subbands and each subband has its own amplification coefficient. The non-uniform spaced subbands can be realized with Variable Bandwidth Filters (VBF). Each VBF can be realized as a combination of arbitrary sample rate converters and FIR filter. The Distributed Arithmetic (DA) based FIR filter is a wise choice where all the multiplications and additions are replaced by a lookup table and shifter-accumulator. The proposed architecture uses a multiplier less structure, where the sample rate converters are realized using Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC) filters and the FIR filter uses Distributed Arithmetic. The use of multiplier less structures leads to significant decrease in area and power consumption. The FPGA platform offers flexible, denser, faster and more power efficient solutions and hence the overall structure can be efficiently implemented using FPGA., Variable Bandwidth Filters, cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filters, Distributed Arithmetic (DA), FPGA. © 2016 IEEE.","cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filters; Distributed Arithmetic (DA); FPGA; Variable Bandwidth Filters","Audition; Bandpass filters; Bandwidth; Comb filters; Digital filters; Digital signal processors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Filter banks; Frequency multiplying circuits; Hearing aids; Integrated circuit design; Signal sampling; Table lookup; Amplification coefficient; Cascaded Integrator Comb filters; Design and implementations; Distributed arithmetic; Electro-acoustic devices; Power-efficient solutions; Proposed architectures; Variable bandwidths; FIR filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

This problem can be overcome by predicting the data beforehand and using the predicted data when there is a delay in the arrival of the data or when the data goes missing.

In many designs automatic detection and correction of errors is of prime importance. In the meantime the techniques that add to detect and correct errors will make the system more sluggish. This paper proposes a method for error detection and correction in parallel IIR filters based on error correction codes. Even though a lot of studies have been done with FIR filters, the area of IIR filters have received very less attention. The reason for this is design of an IIR filter is much complicated than an FIR filter due to its recursive nature. Scaling and roundoff error plays a major role and special care must be taken to overcome this. To improve the speed of the system, the conventional adders and multipliers are replaced with carry select adder and Booth multiplier. The effectiveness of the scheme is shown in terms of error protection, hardware utilization and delay. A remarkable reduction in delay is obtained through the application of these algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.","Booth Algorithm; Carry Select Adder; Delay efficiency; Error correction codes (ECCs); Parallel filters","Adders; Bandpass filters; Error correction; Error detection; Errors; FIR filters; VLSI circuits; Booth algorithm; Carry select adders; Correction of errors; Error correction codes; Error correction codes (ECCs); Error detection and correction; Hardware utilization; Internal and external factors; IIR filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

The involuntary movements of subjects frequently infuse motion artifacts to SD-OCT images. Sub-sampling of signals is introduced in imaging protocol to avoid such artifacts which causes fall in spatial resolution and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Sparse coding (SC) is opted for restoration and rectification of complete signals from sparse samples through constructing complete and sparse space dictionaries independently. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be casted as SC for jointly learning dictionaries resulting less number of CNN filters (equivalence of SC dictionaries) to be trained. The proposed approach extends the separable filters to CNN through architectural constrain. This results in a parallel architecture and reduced number of parameters without compromising on performance.

This paper proposes a fully backward compatible novel method for bandwidth extension of NB speech. The method uses magnitude spectrum data hiding technique to provide a perceptually better wideband speech signal. Code excited linear prediction parameters are extracted from the down sampled frequency shifted version of the high frequency components of speech signal existing above NB, which are spread by using pseudo-noise codes, and are embedded in the low amplitude high-frequency regions of the magnitude spectrum of NB speech signal. The embedded information is extracted at the receiving end to reconstruct the wideband speech signal. Theoretical and simulation analyses show that the proposed method is robust to quantization and channel noises. The comparison category rating listening and log spectral distortion tests clearly show that the reconstructed wideband signal gives a much better performance in terms of speech quality when compared to some of the existing speech bandwidth extension methods employing data hiding. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CELP; Log spectral distortion (LSD); Magnitude spectrum data hiding; Speech bandwidth extension; Speech quality; Spread spectrum","Bandwidth; Speech; Speech intelligibility; Steganography; Telephone sets; Bandwidth extension; CELP; Data hiding; Log spectral distortions; Speech quality; Spread spectra; Speech communication","Nizampatnam, P.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology WarangalIndia; email: prasad.niz@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13812416,,ISTEF,,"English","Int J Speech Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010812438

Being contradictory in nature these two requirements pose design challenges. This paper presents an innovative application of a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (HTS) function to vary the time-varying pole-radius (TVPR) of the pole-zero-constrained (PZC) IIR notch filter to optimally attain these two requirements together. Application of HTS function has allowed the pole-radius to maintain its desired minimum value during the initial phase of filtering, leading to faster transient suppression. This is followed by a steep rise in the pole-radius which allowed the notch filter to attain its desired quality factor soon after the transient suppression was achieved. Therefore, prime emphasis of the proposed notch filter design approach is on the significant reduction of the duration during which pole-radius makes a transition from its minimum to maximum designed values. The performance of proposed notch filter was assessed for transient suppression and selectivity responses in addition to removal of the power line interference from an ECG signal in the LabVIEW™ based simulation and hardware implementation environment. Based on significant improved performances over recent reported exponential TVPR PZC IIR notch filter in all the presented investigations, it is concluded that the proposed design is a better candidate for enhancing the post-transient performance of IIR PZC notch filter. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Digital IIR notch filter; ECG signals; Pole-radius-varying filter; Post-transient filter performance enhancement; Transient suppression","Bandpass filters; Electrocardiography; Hardware; Hyperbolic functions; IIR filters; Poles; Signal processing; ECG signals; Filter performance; IIR notch filters; Pole radius; Transient suppression; Notch filters; Article; computer; computer simulation; controlled study; digital IIR notch filter; electrocardiography; filter; filter design; frequency modulation; hyperbolic tangent sigmoid; image quality; performance; priority journal; radiological parameters; sigmoid; signal noise ratio; signal processing; simulator; time; time varying pole radius","Rana, K.P.S.; Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Sector-3, Dwarka, India; email: kpsrana1@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",17468094,,,,"English","Biomed.

To confirmed the circular polarization in proposed antenna, E-field distribution on different phases (φ = 0º, 90º, 180º, and 270º) have been plotted. This antenna provides measured −10 dB input impedance bandwidth of 25.94% (centered on 4.70 GHz) and 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth in broadside direction of 17.34% (centered on 4.90 GHz). The average gain and radiation efficiency in working band are 1.56 dBi and 93.43% in broadside direction, respectively. CP radiation pattern shows that the proposed antenna has left hand circular polarization and this developed antenna could be useful for wireless applications like WLAN/Wi-MAX bands. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","axial ratio; circular polarization; coplanar waveguide; dielectric resonator antenna; wideband","Antenna feeders; Bandwidth; Circular polarization; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Coplanar waveguides; Cylindrical antennas; Dielectric devices; Dielectric resonators; Electric impedance; Electric impedance measurement; Microstrip lines; Microwave antennas; Microwave filters; Permittivity; Polarization; Resonators; Wireless telecommunication systems; Axial ratio; Cylindrical dielectric resonator antennas; Cylindrical dielectric resonators; Dielectric resonator antennas; E-field distributions; Input impedance bandwidths; Left-hand circular polarizations; Wide-band; Directional patterns (antenna)","Chaudhary, R.K.; Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), DhanbadIndia; email: raghvendra.chaudhary@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",10964290,,IJMEF,,"English","Int J RF Microwave Comput Aided Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996523353

A novel design method for Farrow structure based VDFs in CSD space with reduced hardware complexity is proposed in this paper. The design approach makes use of the multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) optimization algorithm with an integer search space to find the optimal Farrow sub-filter coefficients. Further, a novel low complexity implementation approach for the finite precision VDF using a minimal spanning tree approach is also proposed. The minimal spanning tree approach deploys the shift inclusive differential coefficients (SIDCs) and the different shifted SIDCs with common sub-expression elimination (CSE) to optimize the multiple constant multiplications involved in the filter realization. The attractive feature of our proposed method using MOABC and SIDCs with CSE lies in the increased hardware complexity reduction of the VDFs, compared to the existing methods, which in turn reduces the hardware resource utilization and power consumption drastically compared to the continuous coefficient VDFs. The hardware implementation of the VDF using the proposed method has also been done using Xilinx ISE to analyse the reduction in the hardware complexity and dynamic power. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial bee colony (ABC); Canonic signed digit; Minimal spanning tree; Multi-objective ABC; Shift inclusive differential coefficients; Variable digital filters","Bandpass filters; Design; Hardware; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Canonic signed digit; Differential coefficient; Minimal spanning tree; Multi objective; Variable digital filter; Digital filters","Bindima, T.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia",,"Elsevier Ltd",09521976,,EAAIE,,"English","Eng Appl Artif Intell",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008315335

However, the available number of samples from a subject's EEG is very less. In such a situation, learning models which use spatial features obtained using common spatial pattern (CSP) method suffer from overfitting and leads to degradation in performance. In this paper, we propose a novel three phase method CKSCSP which automatically determines a minimal set of relevant electrodes along with their spatial location to achieve enhanced performance to distinguish motor imagery tasks for a given subject. In the first phase, electrodes placed on brain scalp are divided among five major regions (lobes) viz. frontal, central, temporal, parietal and occipital based on anatomy of brain. In the second phase, stationary-CSP is used to extract features from each region separately. Stationary-CSP will handle the non-stationarity of EEG. In the third phase, recursive feature elimination in conjunction with composite kernel support vector machine is used to rank brain regions according to their relevance to distinguish two motor-imagery tasks. Experimental results on publically available datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in comparison to CSP and stationary CSP.

The proposed multi-constraint, multi-objective routing optimization approach under strict resource constraints guarantees reliability and fast data delivery along with efficient power management in spite of unreliable wireless links and limited power supply. In query driven applications, the request from the sink to the individual sensor node will be a broadcast message, whereas the individual sensor nodes replies back to sink as unicast messages. In the proposed work, the fuzzy approach and “A Star” algorithm are utilized for satisfying energy and bandwidth constraints to route the broadcast messages of the sink while querying all the sensor nodes in the network. Every node will be provided with a guidance list, which is used to decide the next best neighbor node with good route quality for forwarding the received multi-hop broadcast messages. The route quality of the every node is estimated with fuzzy rules based on the network parameters such as maximum remaining energy, minimum traffic load and better link quality to increase the network lifetime. The provision of overhearing the broadcast messages and acknowledgements within the transmission range minimizes the effort to search for the active time of nodes while routing the broadcast messages with asynchronous scheduling. Further, in the proposed work only the time slot of its nearest neighbor relay node (to which packets are to be forwarded) is learnt to reduce the number of message transmissions in the network. For the unicast message replies, the fuzzy membership function is modified and devised based on the routing metrics such as higher residual energy, minimum traffic loads and minimum hop count under energy and bandwidth constraints. Also, the multi-hop heuristic routing algorithm called Nearest Neighbor Tree is effectively used to reduce the number of neighbors in the guidance list that are elected for forwarding. This helps to increase the individual sensor node's lifetime, thereby maximizes the network lifetime and guarantees increased network throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed technique reduces repeated transmissions, decreases the number of transmissions, shortens the active time of the sensor nodes and increases the network lifetime for query driven sensor network applications invariant to total the number of sensor nodes and sinks in the network. The proposed algorithm is tested in a small test bed of sensor network with ten nodes that monitors the room temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bandwidth efficient; Distributed algorithm; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetime; Multi-hop routing; Wireless sensor network","Bandwidth; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy inference; Information management; Membership functions; Network routing; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Power management; Sensor nodes; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Bandwidth efficient; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetimes; Multi-hop routing; Power management (telecommunication)","Kavi Priya, S.; Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College (Autonomous)India; email: urskavi@mepcoeng.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

In this manuscript, linear phase multiband stop filters (LPMBSFs) are designed using a robust hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called improved cuckoo search particle swarm optimization (ICSPSO) for searching desired impulse responses of the filters. Generally LPMBSFs are considered for simultaneous processing of group of spectra widely used in digital communication and signal processing applications. The window method and the simple frequency sampling method of designing linear phase multiband filters (LPMBFs) have no precise control over the stop band and pass band cut-off frequencies. Thus in order to improve the design strategy of the LPMBSF, optimum design criterion is devised where the error between ideal frequency response and practical frequency response is reduced by incorporating the efficient modern swarm and global evolutionary computation technique. The ICSPSO technique is such an excellent hybrid global random search technique for error minimization, and is structured incorporating the advantages of cuckoo search algorithm into particle swarm optimization (PSO) while the global searching capability is further accelerated by tuning the mutation operation of differential evolution (DE) technique.

In this article, we study sectored DRAM caches that exercise large allocation units called sectors, invest reasonably small storage to maintain tag/state, enable space- and bandwidth-efficient tag/state caching due to low tag working set size and large data coverage per tag element, and minimize main memory bandwidth wastage by fetching only the useful portions of an allocated sector. However, the sectored caches suffer from poor space utilization, since a large sector is always allocated even if the sector utilization is low. The recently proposed Unison cache addresses only a special case of this problem by not allocating the sectors that have only one active block. We propose Micro-sector cache, a locality-aware sectored DRAM cache architecture that features a flexible mechanism to allocate cache blocks within a sector and a locality-aware sector replacement algorithm. Simulation studies on a set of 30 16-way multi-programmed workloads show that our proposal, when incorporated in an optimized Unison cache baseline, improves performance (weighted speedup) by 8%, 14%, and 16% on average, respectively, for 1KB, 2KB, and 4KB sectors at 128MB capacity. These performance improvements result from significantly better cache space utilization, leading to 18%, 21%, and 22% average reduction in DRAM cache read misses, respectively, for 1KB, 2KB, and 4KB sectors at 128MB capacity. We evaluate our proposal for DRAM cache capacities ranging from 128MB to 1GB. © 2017 ACM 1544-3566/2017/03-ART7 $15.00.","DRAM cache; Sectored cache; Space utilization","Bandwidth; Digital storage; Bandwidth efficient; Cache architecture; Flexible mechanisms; Recent researches; Replacement algorithm; Sectored cache; Simulation studies; Space utilization; Dynamic random access storage",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15443566,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

The high bandwidth demand and the large storage requirements are the main challenges in such systems. To face these challenges, the system can be deployed as a multi-tier framework that utilizes different technologies. In such a framework, technologies proposed under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a significant rule in facing the challenges. In video surveillance, the cameras can be considered as “the things” that are streaming videos to a central processing and storage server (the cloud) through the Internet. Wireless technologies can be used to connect wireless cameras to the surveillance system more conveniently than wired cameras. Unfortunately, wireless communication in general tend to have limited bandwidth that needs careful management to achieve scalability. In this paper, we design and evaluate a reliable IoT-based wireless video surveillance system that provides an optimal bandwidth distribution and allocation to minimize the overall surveillance video distortion. We evaluate our system using NS-3 simulation. The results show that the proposed framework fully utilizes the available cloud bandwidth budget and achieves high scalability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Internet of Things; Mobile edge computing; Wireless surveillance system","Bandwidth; Budget control; Cameras; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Internet of things; Monitoring; Network security; Scalability; Video signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Edge computing; Internet of thing (IOT); Large-scale video surveillances; Storage requirements; Surveillance systems; Wireless communications; Wireless surveillance system; Wireless technologies; Security systems","Alsmirat, M.A.; Department of Computer Science, Jordan University of Science and TechnologyJordan; email: masmirat@just.edu.jo",,"Springer New York LLC",09208542,,JOSUE,,"English","J Supercomput",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984815904

The drawback of FIR digital filters is its high hardware complexity due to large number of multiplications. This paper introduced a novel design methodology for implementing Multiplierless FIR filter in hardware. The proposed algorithm aiming at the reduction of hardware cost by minimizing the number of sign power of two terms (non zero terms) in filter coefficient. In this paper, we implemented multiplierless FIR filter with and without optimized coefficients and their performances are compared in terms of speed, power, and area. It is observed that the power consumption for multiplierless FIR filter with unoptimized coefficient is 0.182W and the power consumption for multiplierless FIR filter with optimized coefficient is 0.176W. It also consumes fewer resources as compare to unoptimized coefficient multiplierless FIR filter.","Coefficient optimization; Dynamic power; FIR filter; Multiplierless","Bandpass filters; Design; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; Electric power utilization; Hardware; Signal processing; Dynamic Power; Filter coefficients; FIR digital filters; Hardware complexity; Minimizing the number of; Multiplier-less; Multiplier-less fir filters; Novel design methodology; FIR filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032914,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Among many applications target tracking application requires sensor nodes to be localized with minor error. To maintain the target tracking in timely fashion with accurate measurement of target movement is difficult as it summed up with many noises during the detection. Possibilities of node failure often come across in the tracking which results in loss of tracking. Thus to overcome difficulties of tracking new improved tracking framework called as Face (Polygons) Track is proposed. In Face Track sensors are deployed in polygonal fashion. Where polygon share common edge with non overlapping pattern these polygons are the faces and edges being reconstructed to generate each face further so as to avoid loss of tracking. In Face track with Kalman filter, KF optimally selects node as target moves ahead crossing the edges of the face. The Face track network is mapped to develop the courier management system. In this courier management, optimal node selection function selects the number of nodes between source and destination on basis of distance calculated between these node so as to refer nearest node. © 2016 IEEE.","courier management; face track; Kalman filter; optimal node selection; wireless sensor network","Bandpass filters; Clutter (information theory); Geometry; Kalman filters; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Accurate measurement; face track; Management service; Management systems; Node selection; Non-overlapping patterns; Target movements; Wireless sensor communication; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026128,,,"English","Int.

Hence, screening of mammograms for detection of masses is essential, which is crucial task for the radiologist, due to variation in contrast and homogeneous structure of the masses and surrounding breast tissue. Therefore, denosing and enhancement of the mammograms using wavelet shrinkage and homomorphic filtering is presented in this paper. The approach contains, artifact suppression using threshold technique in pre-processing. Then wavelet transform is applied on the pre-processed mammogram, the wavelet shrinkage operator is applied on the detail coefficients for denosing and homomorphic filtering is applied on approximate coefficients for enhancement of mammograms. Finally, an inverse wavelet transform is taken to obtain the denoised and enhanced mammograms. The obtain results of the presented method gives better visibility for suspicious masses. © 2016 IEEE.","Denosing; Enhancement; Mammogram; Pre-processing; Wavelet transform","Bandpass filters; Diseases; Image enhancement; Inverse problems; Mammography; Shrinkage; X ray screens; Artifact suppression; Contrast Enhancement; De-nosing; Homogeneous structure; Homomorphic filtering; Inverse wavelet transforms; Mammogram; Pre-processing; Wavelet transforms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015221,,,"English","Int.

Further, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals makes the task more difficult. Determination of epileptic focus is essential for the treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. This requires accurate separation of focal and non-focal groups of EEG signals. Hence, an intelligent system that can detect and discriminate focal–class (FC) and non–focal–class (NFC) of EEG signals automatically can aid the clinicians in their diagnosis. In order to facilitate accurate analysis of non-stationary signals, joint time–frequency localized bases are highly desirable. The performance of wavelet bases is found to be effective in analyzing transient and abrupt behavior of EEG signals. Hence, we employ a novel class of orthogonal wavelet filter banks which are localized in time–frequency domain to detect FC and NFC EEG signals automatically. We classify EEG signals as FC and NFC using the proposed wavelet based system. We compute various entropies from the wavelet coefficients of the signals. These entropies are used as discriminating features for the classification of FC and NFC of EEG signals. The features are ranked using Student's t-test ranking algorithm and then fed to Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS–SVM) to classify the signals. Our proposed method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 94.25%. We have obtained 91.95% sensitivity and 96.56% specificity, respectively, using this method. The classification of FC and NFC of EEG signals helps in localization of the affected brain area which needs to undergo surgery. © 2016","EEG; Epilepsy; Focal EEG signals; LS–SVM; Non–focal EEG signals; Time–frequency localization; Wavelet entropies; Wavelet filter banks","Bandpass filters; Electroencephalography; Entropy; Filter banks; Frequency domain analysis; Intelligent systems; Neurology; Signal detection; Support vector machines; Wavelet analysis; EEG signals; Epilepsy; LS-SVM; Time-frequency localization; Wavelet entropies; Wavelet filter banks; Biomedical signal processing","Sharma, M.; Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Indore 453552, India; email: manishsharma.iitb@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09507051,,KNSYE,,"English","Knowl Based Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008233959

Shunt active power filters (SAPF) are broadly implemented in power systems for mitigating the harmonic current component as well as to recompense imaginary or reactive power owing to their exact and reckless operation. The objective of this paper is to improve power quality through mitigating harmonics. This paper focuses on sinusoidal current based controller used in a shunt active power filter system (SAPF). Sinusoidal current control strategy is used to extract alternating (sinusoid) current commencing the source. The sinusoidal Currents, in addition with a stout synchronizing circuit (PLL circuit), custom a brief controller meant for shunt active filter. Power filter offers current compensation in such a manner that the shunt current drained from the system is sinusoidal and stable, analogous in the direction of the positive-sequence constituent of load current. SAPF is precise by a sinusoidal current control based controller in order to perform like a harmonic isolator among supply and load. Action of the shunt active filter under passive load conditions using non-linear load, the performance of the sinusoidal current control technique is evaluated using MATLAB R2015a. Total harmonic distortion (THD) of voltage as well as of current determines the practical feasibility of controller designed for shunt active filter to deliver a harmonic separation of passive loads. © 2016 IEEE.","Harmonic Current Compensation; PLL; Shunt Active Power Filter; Sinusoidal Current Control Strategy","Bandpass filters; Controllers; Electric current control; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Passive filters; Phase locked loops; Power control; Power electronics; Harmonic current compensations; Harmonics in power systems; Shunt active filters; Shunt active power filter (SAPF); Shunt active power filters; Sinusoidal currents; Synchronizing circuits; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Active filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

They inject harmonics to the system and the normal delta-star distribution transformer traps the injected triple-n harmonics in the primary delta winding. This leads to the deterioration and reduction in the life of transformer. Hence, a three winding star-star-delta-utilized transformer is used to trap this harmonic or drainage power in the non-linear power system. This drainage power can be used to power auxiliary loads connected across the tertiary delta winding. Also, drainage power recovery makes the system performance better as triple-n harmonics are eliminated from supply line. For balanced and unbalanced secondary non-linear loads, the tertiary power can be recovered. Also, it can be stored in rechargeable batteries to power regulated loads. In this paper, the use of battery stored drainage power for the voltage regulation in shunt active filters is being discussed. The shunt active filter using Icosφ algorithm provides better harmonic elimination of non-linear load. When a load fluctuation occurs, the dc link capacitor voltage in the filter also fluctuates. Usually, the power needed for voltage regulation is supplied by the grid. In the proposed system, the drainage power stored in the battery is used for the voltage regulation. For using shunt active filter in the YYD-utilized transformer system, the control algorithm of the filter needs to be modified in order to sustain the triple-n harmonics in the system. The power recovered from triple-n harmonics can be stored in a battery and can be further used as the energy storage element of the filter. Results analyzed using MATLAB/SIMULINK reveals that the YYD-utilized system along with shunt active filter gives better utilization of drainage power and the overall system provides harmonic elimination. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery Stored Drainage Power; Modified Icos Algorithm; Shunt Active Filter (SAF); Star-star-delta-utilized Transformer (YYD-utilized Transformer)","Bandpass filters; DC transformers; Electric batteries; Electric transformers; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Recovery; Secondary batteries; Stars; Voltage regulators; Winding; Battery Stored Drainage Power; DC link voltage regulation; Dc-link capacitor voltages; Distribution transformer; Harmonic elimination; Primary delta winding; Shunt active filters; Star delta; Active filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

To reduce the harmonic currents, the simplest method is to utilize the passive filters generally known as Harmonic Traps. However, passive filters alone cannot eliminate all harmonic components. Besides, there are limitations on the use of passive filtering. Hence, hybrid filtering technique incorporating passive and active filters is the solution for the present power electronic systems. The active filters may be connected either in series or parallel with the mains. Hybrid harmonic filter considered in this paper is an effective solution for harmonic mitigation and its effective implementation. The detail design and simulation of a innovative hybrid filter for harmonic elimination in low tension power distribution systems is presented in this paper. The percentage total harmonic distribution of the compensated load voltage has been considered as a measure of performance. © 2016 IEEE.","Hybrid Filter; Passive Filter; Power Quality; Shunt & Series Active Harmonic Filter; Total Harmonic Distortion","Bandpass filters; Electric rectifiers; Electric transformers; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Power quality; Rectifying circuits; Switched mode power supplies; Variable speed drives; Active harmonic filters; Adjustable speed drives; Distribution transformer; Hybrid filters; Measure of performance; Power distribution system; Power electronic systems; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Passive filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In real-time, the usage of the radio spectrum is rigorously very low and the most of the spectrum is under-utilized. Recent researches in cognitive radio (CR) address these problems. In CR, spectrum sensing is a key factor. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is used for multicarrier data transmission. OFDM is found to be a suitable method for spectrum sensing in CR. However, spectral leakage and cyclic prefix (CP) in OFDM reduce the spectrum efficiency. Recently, for data transmission and spectrum sensing, multicarrier filter banks (FBMC) are recently considered as an alternative to OFDM. In this paper, we propose a two-stage spectrum sensing for CR, using Cosine Modulated Filter Banks (CMFB).

In the present work, a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is implemented for generating desired harmonic reference currents and for regulating the DC side voltage of SHAPF.

The circular polarization provides better power reception in whatever the direction body worn antenna turns. For achieving the circular polarization, a rectangular slot of 45° at the center of the circular patch is used. In the ground plane a rectangular cross slot is introduced for improving the bandwidth. The simulation result shows that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 110 MHz and the gain of the antenna is 3.6 dB. The designed antenna is fabricated on the textile substrate where copper tape is used as the conductive material for the patch and the ground plane. The measured operating frequency range of antenna spans from 2.40 GHz to 2.51 GHz having a gain of 3.6 dB at 2.45 GHz. Simplified lumped element circuit model of the textile antenna has been derived and simulation is done using CST software.

Road, Raipur, 492010, India","Security of video encryption schemes is an issue yet to be addressed to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. In the one end of the spectrum, there are applications which require highest level of security and they use conventional encryption schemes which are neither bandwidth efficient nor format preserving. Thus limit their application to a large extent. Other end of the spectrum is occupied by selective encryption schemes which are used by most of the commercial applications. These schemes though bandwidth efficient are not secure as these schemes are designed to degrade the video quality but overall content remain intelligible. Thus a scheme which is highly secure yet bandwidth efficient is the need of the hour. In this paper, we propose a new format preserving selective encryption scheme for JPEG and MPEG which is compression friendly as well as highly secure. We choose the quantized DCT coefficients of the I-frame for encryption. The resultant image/video is completely obscure and is suitable for high end security applications. Also there is no reduction in the performance of compression algorithms applied later in the standard JPEG/MPEG pipeline. Experiments show that the encrypted image/video file is almost of the same size as that of un-encrypted version. Thus the scheme is suitable for applications like tele-medicine, on-the-go video conferencing using low bandwidth cellular networks, etc. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","JPEG; MPEG; RC4 stream cipher; Secure video conferencing","Bandwidth; Cryptography; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Video cameras; Video conferencing; Commercial applications; Compression algorithms; JPEG; MPEG; Quantized DCT coefficients; Security application; Selective encryption; Stream Ciphers; Network security","Meenpal, T.; Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, Telecommunication Department NIT Raipur, India, NIT Raipur, G.E.

In the proposed architecture, silicon rods (n= 3.4641) are contrived over an air substrate of refractive index n= 1 in the equilateral triangular lattice which has the lattice constant a=900nm. The characteristics of the design are examined for various types of pillars (circular and elliptical) and are reported in the analysis. The band gap for each structure is calculated and observed by plane-wave expansion method. The normalized transmission spectra and resonance wavelengths for different photonic crystal ring resonators are obtained using 2D finite-difference time-domain method.

The proposed design is completely shift invariant and represents the input image by one low-pass and multiscale N directional band-pass subbands. Here, N represents estimated number of dominant directions present in the input image. Our design consists of two main filter bank stages. A fix partitioned complex-valued directional filter bank (CDFB) is at the core of the design followed by a novel partition filter bank stage. Fine partitioning of the CDFB subbands is used to get the adaptive nature of the proposed transform. The partitioning decision is made based on the directional significance of range of CDFB subband angle selectivity in the input image. Partition filter bank stage which nonuniformly partitions the CDFB subbands provides total N dominant direction selective subbands. Local orientation map of the input image is used to determine the dominant directions and hence N. For better sparsity properties, we design the multiresolution stage with filters having high vanishing moments and better frequency selectivity. Applicability of the proposed adaptive design is shown for pansharpening of multispectral images. Our proposed pansharpening approach is evaluated on images captured using QuickBird and IKONOS-2 satellites. Results obtained using the proposed approach on these datasets show considerable improvements in qualitative as well as quantitative evaluations when compared to state-of-the-art pansharpening approaches including transform-based methods. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Adaptive transform; Multiresolution directional filter bank; Pansharpening","Bandpass filters; Design; Adaptive multi resolutions; Adaptive transform; Directional filter banks; Frequency selectivity; Pan-sharpening; Quantitative evaluation; Spatial orientations; Transform-based methods; Filter banks","Gajbhar, S.S.; Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication TechnologyIndia; email: shrishail_gajbhar@daiict.ac.in",,"Springer London",18631703,,,,"English","Signal Image Video Process.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978100343

Traditional implementations have been using application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or DSP processors. However, the increase in logic capacity and versatility of the field programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms has made it possible to realize numerically intense algorithms and thus provide a complete system-on-chip (SoC) solution in a single package. With modern FPGAs fast moving from prototype designing to low and medium volume productions, it becomes imperative to consider architectural optimizations that are specific to FPGAs only. In this paper, for the first time, we attempt to optimize filtering structures by considering the technology-dependent approaches. We present a general procedure that can be used to efficiently map the Boolean networks onto FPGA fabric. Based on this procedure, a technology optimal realization of the multiply-adder unit, which is a fundamental functional unit in FIR filters is presented. Since no such implementation has been reported, we have compared our implementations against the various technology-independent optimizations that have been detailed in prior literature. Further, to give an idea about the performance speed-up achieved with our implementations, we have compared our results against the FIR structures based on the multiply-adder IP v 2.0, inherent in Xilinx FPGAs. A distinctive feature of our implementation is that a simultaneous speed-up is achieved in all three parameters (area, speed and power). This is in contrast to the technology-independent implementations where there is always a performance trade-off between different parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","FIR filters; FPGA realizations; Look-up table; Technology mapping; Technology-Dependent optimization; Ternary adder","Adders; Application specific integrated circuits; Bandpass filters; Digital signal processing; Economic and social effects; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Impulse response; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; System-on-chip; Table lookup; Digital signal processing (DSP); Filtering structures; Look up table; Optimal realization; Performance trade-off; Technology independent; Technology mapping; Various technologies; FIR filters","Khurshid, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology SrinagarIndia; email: burhan_07phd12@nitsri.net",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010871644

This paper investigates the innovative concept of adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) using cascaded form of least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filters. The concept of cascading and its algorithm for real-time LMS-ANC are also described in detail. The model of the cascaded LMS-ANC is designed and simulated on MATLAB Simulink. The simulation model gives variation in the distinct signals of LMS-ANC like error, output and weights at various LMS filter parameters. The proposed algorithm utilizes two adaptive filters to estimate gradients accurately and results in good adaptation and performance. The objective of the present investigation is to provide solution in order to improve the performance of noise canceller in terms of filter parameters. The results are obtained with the help of adaptive algorithm with variable step size and different initial weight of filters which provides high convergence speed of error signal. This paper also includes the derivation for the convergence rate at different conditions and concludes that cascaded LMS-ANC results in higher convergence rate and better output signal as compared to single LMS-ANC.

In MLR WDM networks, channels are structured as sub-bands, each of which consists of wavelengths operating at a similar data rate. By reducing the (1) spacing within a sub-band, or (2) spacing between sub-bands operating at different data rates, spectral efficiency can be improved. However, owing to high physical layer impairment levels, decrease in sub-band spacing adversely affects transmission reach of the channels, which results in higher power consumption due to requirement of increased signal regeneration. In this work, we compare power efficiency of various MLR and single-line-rate (SLR) solutions, and also investigate the trade-off that exists between spectral and power efficiency in a WDM network. Simulation results indicate that (1) for high transmission capacities, a combination of 100 Gbps transponders and 40 Gbps regenerators will obtain the highest power efficiency; (2) for long connection distances, a point ofmerging occurs for various SLR and MLR designs, where power consumption is independent of the frequency band distribution; and (3) for MLR systems, both spectral and power efficiency can be improved by using either shorter links with higher bandwidth assignment to 100 Gbps wavelengths, or longer links with higher bandwidth assignment to 40 Gbps wavelengths.

Some features of Euclidean shape geometry are improved after the application of fractals at the edges of the polygon. It is demonstrated that the application of Koch fractal in the antenna design helps to achieve the desired miniaturization, compactness and wideband operability due to its self-similar and space filling characteristics. An analytical expression is provided to calculate the effective length and area of the structure with the increase in iteration’s order. Its performance is further compared with other fractal geometries such as Minkowski and Sierpinski curve. It is observed that the proposed Koch fractal based antenna yields the widest bandwidth and better gain compared to other fractal geometry based antennas. In addition, the time-domain analysis of the antenna is performed in terms of fidelity factor and its values are better than 0.81. 1-Element antennas shows operational bandwidth from 2.3 to 13.2 GHz with a maximum gain value of 3.8 dB, whereas in case of 2-Element antenna operating bandwidth is 2.3−14 GHz with a maximum gain value of 7.2 dB. Moreover, the radiation patterns of the single element and 2-Element are nearly omnidirectional.

The tactical communication depends on factors such as network characteristics, communication media resources, operational mobility, terrain etc. The key challenge is to address typical military communication network constraints such as limited bandwidth and latency, narrow effective communication range, intermittent communication links. Performance of the transport layer protocols is heavily affect by some of the link level impairments like high loss rates, long & variable delays and intermittent. Any random packet loss in the network is considered as congestion by TCP in the network and in order to overcome this congestion and packet-loss TCP employs the congestion control algorithm resulting in poor bandwidth usage of already scarce bandwidth. Similar for the intermittency the transport protocol must detect intermittencies and quickly adjust to intermittent paths it carry mission-critical data in military networks. Heterogeneous communication link (starting from High Frequencies or Very High Frequencies radio sets to satellite links) between sources to destination results is long and variable delays. The interaction of these long delays with the standard TCP slow-start and congestion-avoidance algorithms will damage the TCP performance. A critical survey has been done on various TCP variants to find out which is the best suitable protocol (and variants) under varying impairments for tactical networks. © 2016 IEEE.","Latency; Packet loss; Tactical networks; TCP; Throughput","Bandwidth; Electronic data interchange; Heterogeneous networks; Internet protocols; Military communications; Packet loss; Radio links; Satellite links; Throughput; Transmission control protocol; Congestion avoidance algorithm; Heterogeneous communication; Intermittent communications; Latency; Network characteristics; Tactical Communications; Tactical network; Transport layer protocols; Packet networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

It is found that there is a slight degradation in the performance of the antenna when the superstrate is touching the antenna i.e height of the superstrate above the EMD (H =0 mm). Further, it is also observed that the degraded performance characteristics of the EMD antenna can be improved by placing the dielectric superstrates above the EMD at optimum height (H) = Hopt. The EMD antenna without dielectric superstrate achieves an impedance bandwidth of 3.354 GHz (SWR&lt; 2) at 3.20 GHz, and loaded with dielectric superstrates which shows that the resonate frequency is decreased and achieved impedance bandwidth is 3.351GHz (SWR&lt; 2) at 3.37 GHz. As the dielectric constant of the superstrate increases, it has been observed that the center frequency 3.39 GHz and gain is decreased to 7.40 dB from 7.52 dB. As the height of the superstrate is increased the performance of the antenna improves and at particular optimum height, the gain and bandwidth for all the superstrates will be closer to the free space radiation conditions of the EMD antenna without superstate. However, the return-loss for all dielectric constants of the superstrates is more than -18.60 dB which is well above the acceptable limit. The variation in return-loss is within acceptable limits. This antenna is stable radiation pattern with low cross polarization, low back radiation, nearly identical E- and H-plane patterns.

Digital filter design involves several multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations, which consume a large amount of hardware resources and computation cost. Distributed Arithmetic (DA) approach is proposed in literature as an alternative and efficient technique for MAC operation based designs. Similarly, reconfigurable computing possesses the benefits of both worlds, i.e., flexibility of software and high performance of hardware using flexible high speed computing fabric such as FPGA for efficient use of hardware resources. In this paper, design of FIR filters using the concepts of distributed arithmetic and reconfigurable computing is proposed. Two reconfigurable architectures are proposed and implemented on an SRAM based Xilinx FPGA board. The performance of proposed design is evaluated with and without reconfiguration architectures and their results are reported.

The slotted array consists of three transverse slots in the top wall of SIW which are inclined at 45° with respect to a single longitudinal slot. The number of slots and the position of the slotted array determine the impedance bandwidth. It is found from the simulated and measured results that the impedance bandwidth of the antenna is 92% (10 GHz-27 GHz) for S11 ≤ -10 dB. Multiple modes get excited in the SIW-SAA resulting in multidirectional characteristics and an equivalent circuit model is used to explain the physics of this phenomenon. In the X band, the lowest mode (TE10) of SIW exists and the combination of slotted array and SIW is responsible for unidirectional radiation. Bidirectional and omnidirectional patterns are observed in the elevation plane for Ku and K bands, respectively due to higher order modes that are excited in the bottom wall of SIW.

A novel frequency reconfigurable Vivaldi antenna that can be used for cognitive radio is explored. In a Cognitive Radio system, the antenna should be capable of sensing the entire bandwidth and should be able to select a specific frequency. In this work, spectrum sensing is carried out by a Vivaldi antenna which is operating for a bandwidth of 2.5-12 GHz. The frequency reconfiguration is achieved by inserting switchable hexagonal slots into the ground plane of the structure. Different frequencies from 2.5-12 GHz can be selected by using PIN diodes. Three pairs of hexagonal slots are introduced in the ground plane and if each pair is connected they will radiate corresponding frequency. The designed antenna can select frequencies 2.6 GHz, 6.6 GHz and 10.6 GHz from the entire bandwidth. The advantage this technique is that a single terminal can operate in different modes. This technique also reduces the interference at the reciever. Simulation of the antenna is done by using Ansoft HFSS 15. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Frequency Reconfiguration; Vivaldi antenna; Wideband Antenna","Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Microwave antennas; Radio systems; Semiconductor diodes; Slot antennas; Different frequency; Frequency Reconfiguration; Radio applications; Single terminal; Specific frequencies; Spectrum sensing; Vivaldi antennas; Wideband antenna; Cognitive radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

The critical part of the recommender algorithm is finding the similarity metrics, which yield predictions with different accuracies and varieties. In the case of high dimensional feature space, the recommender systems using traditional similarity metrics suffer from several problems such as cold-start problem, scalability, over-specialization and data imbalance. In this paper, a recommender system using weighted ensemble hybrid similarity metric model is proposed by combining two or more traditional similarity metrics such as Pearson correlation, log-likelihood and Tanimoto coefficient. The digital filter is extended and adapted in order to handle the posterior intractability and spatial smoothing of high dimensional recommender space. The proposed recommender system is implemented using Apache Mahout. The evaluation of the model has been done using three large MovieLens datasets consist of 100 thousand ratings, 1 Million ratings and 10 Million ratings. We provide a quantitative and a qualitative evaluation. Interesting conclusions were extracted from the real-time execution of the proposed system on the above-mentioned data sets.

The requirement of indigenous regional navigational satellite system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite System, like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. Design of IRNSS antenna at user segment is mandatory for Indian region. The IRNSS satellites will be placed at a higher geostationary orbit to have a larger signal footprint and minimum satellites for regional mapping. IRNSS signals will consist of a Special Positioning Service and a Precision Service. Both will be carried on L5 band (1176.45 MHz) and S band (2492.08 MHz). As it is be long range communication system needs high frequency signals and high gain receiving antennas. So, different antennas can be designed to enhance the gain and directivity. Based on this the rectangular Microstrip patch antenna, planar array of patch antennas and planar, wideband feed slot spiral antenna are designed by using various software simulations. Use of array of spiral antennas will increase the gain position. Spiral antennas are comparatively small size and these antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure.

In cloud computing environment the resources are provisioned on the basis of demand, as and when required. In cloud computing a large number of cloud users can request a number of cloud services at the same time. So there must be an efficient way in which all the resources are made available to the requesting user to satisfy their needs. Therefore, an optimal resource allocation is one of the central challenges in cloud computing. In this paper, an approach for optimum allocation of resources is proposed in which different types of resources (virtual machine) are allocated by taking three parameters into consideration: processing element, main memory, and network bandwidth. Users are allowed to submit the parameters during job submission. The user inserted parameters will then be considered while allocating resources to them. The simulations of cloud environment are achieved with the help of CloudSim simulator. The objective of this paper is to make optimum resource allocation and achieve efficient utilization of resources over public cloud.

Camera manufacturers, therefore, depend on image denoising algorithms to reduce the effects of such noise artifacts in the resultant image. The most common type of noise is impulse noise, in which the affected pixels are replaced by noise values which will be either zero or one. First, the noise pixel can be identified by switching method. Second, the median filter applied on every corrupted pixel. Third, compare the neighboring pixel value on input image with the median filtered image, if the two pixels having a difference then apply the M-filter on that. This paper mainly deals with the detection of noisy pixels and applying robust M-filter (lorentzian) method to improve the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and mean square error (MSE) value. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art image denoising methods such as adaptive median filter, decision based filter in terms of both objective measure and visual evaluation. © 2016 IEEE.","Impulse Noise; Lorentz Operator; M-Filter; Noise Detection","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Cameras; Image denoising; Image segmentation; Manufacture; Mean square error; Median filters; Pixels; Salt removal; Signal to noise ratio; Adaptive median filter; Decision based filter; Image denoising algorithm; Lorentz; M-filters; Noise detection; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity indices (SSIM); Impulse noise",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

Orthogonal Frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is best choice in this regard which supports high data rates and bandwidth efficiency. As the number of subcarriers used in OFDM systems increases the data rates supported by it also increases at the cost of high Peak to average power ratio. The high PAPR leads to non-linearities in the system which is unwanted. Upcoming OFDM systems may drive the number of subcarriers used to meet the thrust of data rate demands. So it is required to alleviate the high PAPR that appear. Partial transmit sequence (PTS) is a technique for reduction in PAPR among other techniques. In this paper a method which combines both PTS and Adaptive Peak Power Reduction techniques (APPR). APPR uses an adaptive algorithm to maintain the peak level of modulated signal.

The prototype filter is designed using the optimal value of pass-edge frequency and Kaiser Windowing technique, and filter bank is derived from that single prototype filter. In the proposed work, filter bank of 3 channels is considered. Prototype filter has length 5 with overall delay equal to the order of prototype filter. Complexity is reduced by considering only one feature for the detection of R-Peak. In R-peak detection algorithm after first level of thresholding, mean amplitude of peaks are calculated. In second level, considered only those peaks whose amplitude lies within 3 standard deviations around mean amplitude. Final level peaks are detected by considering refractory period.

The noise instantaneous power spectrum can be considered as approximately constant and estimated in each frequency bin as the variance of a complex Gaussian noise process. The E-DATE estimator is robust that it does not require prior information about the signal probability distribution. The prior information is needed for the weaksparseness property. The E-DATE requires the smallest number of parameters (only two). The block based implementation of EDATE called B-E-DATE and sliding window implementation SW-E-DATE are used in estimating the noise. The estimation delay is reduced by grouping frequency bin in the B-E-DATE. The B-E-DATE has negligible time delay.

Highlights of erasure coded storage systems are that these offer the same level of fault tolerance as that of replication, at lower storage footprints. In the big data era, cloud storage systems based on data replication are of dubious usability due to 200% storage overhead in data replication systems. This has prompted storage service providers to use erasure coded storage as an alternative to replication. Refinements are required in various aspects of erasure coded storage systems to make it a real contender against data replication based storage systems. Streamlining huge bandwidth requirements during the recovery of failed nodes, inefficient update operations, effect of topology in recovery and consistency requirements of erasure coded storage systems, are some areas which need attention. This paper presents an in-depth study on the challenges faced, and research pursued in some of these areas. The survey shows that more research is required to improve erasure coded storage system from being bandwidth crunchers to efficient storage systems. Another challenge that has emerged from the study is the requirement of elaborate research for upgrading the erasure coded storage systems from being mere archival storage systems by providing better update methods. Provision of multiple level consistency in erasure coded storage is yet another research opportunity identified in this work. A brief introduction to open source libraries available for erasure coded storage is also presented in the paper. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Digital storage; Engineering research; Fault tolerance; Archival storage systems; Bandwidth requirement; Cloud storage systems; Consistency requirements; Open-source libraries; Research opportunities; Storage overhead; Storage service providers; Big data",,"Santhosh Kumar G.Poulose Jacob K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012800,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The proposed antenna is able to work in two frequency bands i.e. from 6.27-6.97 GHz and 15.73-19.38 GHz with corresponding resonant frequencies of 6.57 and 17.61 GHz. The impedance bandwidth obtained for both operating bands is 0.703 GHz and 3.64 GHz respectively. High gain of 9.04 dB and 7.82 dB for both bands is obtained. Due to the Spidron defected ground structure, the decrease in the resonant frequency can be seen. The volumetric dimensions of the proposed antenna are highly compact (36 mm×36 mm×0.762 mm) and hence, can be easily integrated with other microwave circuits. The proposed structure covers super-extended C-band, partial K-band and Ku-band, hence suitable for several satellite transmission applications. The proposed antenna designs have been simulated using ANSYS HFSS.

The major constraints in transmitting this massive amount of mission critical data are bandwidth and computational time. In this paper, we aim to develop an entropy based video compression system based on H.264 standard which suits the demands of on-board space application. One of the most time consuming part of H.264 encoder is the intra prediction stage involving exhaustive mode decision criteria. Here, we focuses on developing a fast intra prediction algorithm which provides acceptable performance measures with less computational time to incorporate in the robust H.264 system under development. This paper proposes an efficient block size decision algorithm for intra prediction based on the texture feature of macro blocks. Emphasis was given for luma component of I frames, which are generally coded either using 4×4 or 16×16 blocks. The proposed algorithm can decide the best block size for each MB based on texture feature at an initial stage of prediction instead of examining all block sizes exhaustively as followed in standard JM software. After deciding the best block size using proposed algorithm, three step search algorithm is implemented to find the intra 4×4 prediction mode to achieve further reduction in computational time. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm achieves about 96% decision accuracy with PSNR loss less than 0.0002 dB. Time reduction of around 30 % was obtained with negligible increase in bit rate. © 2016 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Bit rate; H.264; Intra prediction; Mission critical data; PSNR; Texture feature; Video compression","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Forecasting; Image coding; Video signal processing; Bit rates; H.264; Intra Prediction; Mission critical; PSNR; Texture features; Image compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

The aggregate bandwidth requirement at base station of a wireless broadband network is the sum of bandwidth requirements from various services viz., VoIP, browsing, e-mail, streaming multimedia, interactive gaming etc. Due to variation in rates of arrival of service requests during the course of the day, the aggregate bandwidth required to service the traffic fluctuates during the course of the day. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the use of certain correlation functions of stochastic point processes known as product densities to deal with the non-stationarity of the problem. Product densities are suitably defined so that they can be applied to broadband communication networks for non-homogeneous Poisson arrival rate. The aggregate bandwidth and its fluctuation are estimated using Random Point Process (a special class of stochastic point processes) model. An algorithm to evaluate expected aggregate bandwidth and its fluctuation during the course of the day is developed based on Random Point Process and product densities. Such a bandwidth estimation model can assist wireless broadband service providers to estimate time dependent radio spectrum requirements at the base station. The strength of the product density technique lies in expressing the moments of the aggregate bandwidth as integrals, numerical computation of which can be carried out with any technical computing software such as MATLAB. © 2016 IEEE.","Bandwidth Fluctuation; Random Point Processes; Time-dependent Bandwidth; Wireless broadband","Aggregates; Base stations; Broadband networks; MATLAB; Multimedia services; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bandwidth fluctuations; Broadband Communication; Numerical computations; Random point process; Stochastic point process; Time-dependent bandwidth; Wireless broadband; Wireless broadband networks; Bandwidth",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041718,,,"English","FTC - Proc.

Elimination of such unwanted components termed as noise from transmitted signals has remained an important as well as puzzling task for the researchers since the preliminary days of Digital Signal Processing. Among a significant number of techniques proposed for removal of noise from signals, use of digital filters has become most effective in multiple ways. Slighter overheads in designing and lower hardware cost have made the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters popular. Among a considerable number of techniques, use of different window functions for implementation of digital filters is most acceptable. In this paper a new strategy based on the weight lifting strategy of ants has been proposed for optimizing parameters to design a digital filter using Kaiser Window function. A new innovative objective function has been introduced for optimization that performs based on the signal de-noising capability of the filters implemented by the optimized sets of parameters. A case study was carried out on heart sound signals with a filter designed using Kaiser Window with optimized parameters. © 2016 IEEE.","Ant Weight Lifting; Cutoff frequency; Finite Impulse Response Filter; Passband ripple; Sampling frequency; Stopband attenuation","Artificial intelligence; Bandpass filters; Cutoff frequency; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; FIR filters; Impulse response; Objective functions; Optimized parameter; Optimizing parameters; Pass-band ripples; Sampling frequencies; Stopband attenuation; Time of transmission; Weight lifting; Signal processing",,"Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509010479,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The research presented idea gives the performance of various existing transport layer protocol over Vehicular Ad hoc Network (vAnET). One version of TCP called TCP WestwoodNR that dynamically adjusts the congestion window. TCP WestwoodNR constantly estimate the end-To-end bandwidth based on ACK reception rate. These make TCP WestwoodNR more tough to random losses due to wireless channel problems. So these research works improves the performance of TCP WestwoodNR. TCP WestwoodNR cannot bifurcate the loss that packet failure is due to congestion or random loss (link failure). To overcome the problem of TCP WestwoodNR, new Transmission Control Protocol was developed WestwoodNRBWP (Bandwidth Proportionality) which bifurcate the loss using Losses Discrimination scheme. Losses Discrimination Scheme uses last three values of RTT. After loss bifurcation, TCP WestwoodNRBWP check the network status in congestion Avoidance and according to that it set the congestion window (CWND). For the purpose of simulation of proposed algorithm TCP WestwoodNRBWP, the well known network simulator NS-2 and traffic simulator Bonn Motion are used for compare it to real TCP WestwoodNR.

Further, two types of hashes- jenkins hash and murmur hash have been used in the bloom filter; their performance in terms of time, false positive has been compared with each other. It has also been shown that the usage of this additional data structure, bloom filter in the proposed approach is memory-efficient. The paper is an attempt to improve upon the time-efficiency of a map-reduce based crawler. Using bloom filter, based upon comparison against different parameters our results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.","Apache nutch; Bloom filter; Hashing; Search engine; Web crawling; Web graph","Bandpass filters; Data structures; Efficiency; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Iterative methods; Search engines; Apache nutch; Bloom filters; Hashing; Web Crawling; Web graphs; Web crawler",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046072,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Singular valued decomposition technique is introduced to design Linear Phase Orthogonal filter bank which yields efficient and fast results in time critical applications. Signal splitting and efficient reconstruction of the original signal is studied achieving perfect reconstruction condition due to the orthogonal nature of designed filter bank. Ultimate aim of proposed methodology is to design two approximation scenarios in terms of square matrices which apparently maps into the filter bank matrix. Singular valued decomposition is iteratively employed to compute both of these square matrices until achievable convergence is achieved between to alternate iterations. Proposed algorithm starts with the design of least square filter bank and ends with the filter bank which ensures orthogonality conditions as well as all filters in the filter bank satisfying linear phase condition. Thus, faster design of the filter bank along with linear phase orthogonal condition yields multiple applications in signal processing, image processing, communication etc. © 2016 IEEE.","Aliasing errors; Filter bank; FIR; Least square filter bank; Linear phase; Maximally decimated; Orthogonality; Perfect reconstruction; Singular valued decomposition; Subband coding","Bandpass filters; Coding errors; Design; Image processing; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Signal processing; Aliasing error; Least-square filters; Linear phase; Maximally decimated; Orthogonality; Perfect reconstruction; Singular valued decompositions; Subband coding; Filter banks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Thus, Position based routing protocol experiences poor performance. To minimize the effect of position error, this work proposes a Predicted Position Based Routing Protocol (PPRP) for VANET. PPRP predicts the vehicle location based on previous and current location using Kalman Filter (KF) to improve the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), average delay and throughput.

By introducing a tapered section of waveguide between the rectangular waveguide and square ground plane, the coupling to a low permittivity DRA can be improved substantially. Moreover, it offers a 10 dB bandwidth of 6.34% and a maximum gain of 6 dBi. Symmetrical broadside radiation patterns with low levels of cross polarization are maintained in both the planes.

The main drawbacks in the conventional communication techniques are low spectral efficiency, lack of high rate, interferences, etc. The OFDM communication model overcomes the drawbacks of conventional communicational model and offers the high data rate, and high spectral efficiency. Although OFDM has many advantages over FDM but it suffers from inter carrier interference and inter symbol interference when multiple carriers are used and due to this interferences loss of Orthogonality happens, in order to overcome these interferences usage of cyclic prefix has become mandatory. But usage of cyclic prefix shows huge negative impact on bandwidth efficiency as the cyclic prefix approach consumes nearly 20% of bandwidth and BER performance too affected by CP. In this paper a novel wavelet based OFDM model is presented which is mainly intended to provide good Orthogonality and better spectral efficiency using various modulation techniques, the unique thing in the usage of wavelet based OFDM is it does not need the cyclic prefix, CP decreases bandwidth efficiency. But wavelet increases bandwidth and when bandwidth increases simultaneously spectral efficiency increases. Finally the usage of the wavelet based OFDM shows improved BER over conventional FDM communication model. The simulation results indicates the usage of wavelet based OFDM in place of Fourier based OFDM in wireless system and finally the comparison between wavelet based OFDM and DFT based OFDM. In this paper for simulation purpose Additive white Gaussian noise channel (indoor channel) and Stanford University Interim (SUI) channels are used. Here Sanford University channel works like outdoor channel. In every channel and for every modulation scheme wavelet gives improved Bit Error Rate. © 2016 IEEE.","BER; Cyclic prefix; ICI and ISI; OFDM; Spectral efficiency","Bandwidth; Bit error rate; Decoding; Efficiency; Error statistics; Gaussian noise (electronic); Information theory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Modulation; Wavelet analysis; White noise; Wireless telecommunication systems; Additive white Gaussian noise channel; Communication techniques; Cyclic Prefix; High-speed communications; ICI and ISI; Inter carrier interference; Spectral efficiencies; Wireless communication system; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Traditional canny edge detection algorithm uses frame based statistics which gives high accuracy but computationally more complex. Also canny algorithm is more sensitive to noise. In this experiment, an attempt is made to make canny algorithm more robust to noise using morphological filtering. Here canny algorithm is implemented at block level without any compromise in edge detection performance. If frame level statistics are used for threshold selection, it would result in either loss of edges or surplus edge detection. To solve this problem threshold selection is made based on type of block. Smooth and texture pixel counts are calculated for image block. Instead of using probability, actual pixel counts are used to calculate threshold. This makes threshold selection block more adaptive. Finally, objective analysis is carried out which shows proposed block based distributed algorithm is better than traditional frame based algorithm, especially in presence of impulse noise. © 2016 IEEE.","Block based image processing; Canny edge detector; Morphological filter; Simulink","Bandpass filters; Edge detection; Image processing; Pixels; Signal detection; Block based image processing; Canny edge detection; Canny edge detectors; Detection performance; Morphological filtering; Morphological filters; Simulink; Using probabilities; Impulse noise",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The 4th Generation (4G) wireless network standardized as Long Term Evolution (LTE) utilizes advantages Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), where each cell of the network uses same frequency band, i.e Frequency Reuse equal to '1'. This leads to very high inter-cell interference (ICI) for the users at the edges of the cell and results in drastic decrease in cell capacity. To overcome ICI, Partial Frequency Reuse (PFR) method is used. Our paper presents intense mathematical calculations for optimization of cell capacity considering higher number of users near cell center. The cell partitioning radius is the variable parameter considered for mathematical integration operation for optimization problem. Assuming initial stationary position of a user nearby base station we use optimization for percentage of bandwidth reassigned to the cell-center region from partial frequency reuse region.As presented in this paper the variable user position from the base station is considered later to evaluate the optimization problem completely for demonstration of tradeoff between cell capacity and cell partitioning radius.

It forces us to do our best. Nowadays, in the area of cloud computing, it is at the peak between the larger number of cloud users and cloud providers who view for the opportunity to use and provide services. Competition among cloud users means the price of cloud services never fall very low and between cloud providers mean the price of services never rises very high. It gives an opportunity to users toa find good cloud resource provider who provideQoS at the cheapest rate, on the other hand, competition between providers to attract the cloud users. This leads to use pay-per-use model of cloud computing but the growing structured and unstructured datasets force us to enhance the flexibility of database resources in cloud computing. We present the elasticity definition for the DBaaS and improve the response time of the database resources such as random access memory access efficiency by using the bloom filter space efficient data structure. It filter the records before join operation of the complex query. On improving the response time it directly affects the elasticity of the DBaaS. We consider the venerable relational database(RDBMS) instead of the native database (NOSQL) for the complex queries of OLAP workload and achieve the 40% enhancement in elasticity over the without bloom filter models. This achievement eases the life of cloud providers to follow the use pay-per-use principle to attract their client. © 2016 IEEE.","Bloom filter; Dbaas; Elasticity; OLAP; Response time; SQL; Wait type","Bandpass filters; Data structures; Elasticity; Query languages; Query processing; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Bloom filters; Dbaas; OLAP; Pay-per-use model; Random access memory; Relational Database; Resource providers; Wait type; Cloud computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The scheme is based on the intrinsic property of the fractional-order filters that the pole frequency can be scaled down to sub-hertz by employing the order if the normal pole frequency of the filter is designed slightly less than one. This is in contrast to the scaling techniques employed in low-frequency integer-order filters where the impedance is scaled to decrease the overall capacitance required for low-frequency design. The functioning of the scheme has been demonstrated by an OTA-based low-pass filter example implemented with 0.35μm technology node at supply voltage.","Biomedical filter design; Fractional-order filters; Impedance scaling; Large time constant; Sub-hertz","Bandpass filters; Capacitance; Operational amplifiers; Poles; Filter designs; Fractional-order filters; Impedance scaling; Large time constant; Sub-hertz; Low pass filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

However, it is highly vulnerable to attacks due to its wireless nature and lack of central authority. This affects the overall performance of the network. To solve this problem, the Watchdog protocol was developed for attack detection. However, if it receives a false report from a misbehaving node, it fails to detect the attack. To overcome this problem, the Integrated Bloom Filter with Watchdog Algorithm (IBFWA) is proposed in this article to avoid packet loss. Here, the Certificate Authority (CA) validates the node through the process of key generation. Then, it checks whether the node is normal or attacker; if it is a black hole node, it will be blocked and communication through this node is avoided. If a node is compromised and revoked as a normal node, it is added to the network and communication through the node is enabled. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed attack detection system in terms of lower node outage, residual energy, end-to-end delay, high detection probability, throughput, packet transfer rate and packet delivery ratio. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Black hole attack; Bloomfilter; Integrated Bloom Filter with Watchdog Algorithm (IBFWA); Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET); Watchdog","Bandpass filters; Data structures; Gravitation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Packet networks; Stars; Attack detection; Black hole attack; Bloom filters; Certificate authority; High detection probability; Misbehaving nodes; Packet delivery ratio; Watchdog; Mobile ad hoc networks","Kollati, V.K.; Vignan's Institute of Engineering for Women, Department Of Computer Science Engineering, Kapujaggaraju peta, Vadlapudi post Backside of VSEZ, India; email: vijay_kollati@yahoo.co.in",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",19393555,,,,"English","Inf.

Li-Fi as opposed to Radio waves in Wi-Fi uses Visible Light for bringing about the communication between two devices. This paper throws light on how Light (VLC) is a feasible solution to the existing problems of radio waves with some useful insights on Li-Fi and how it can improve indoor data transfers and communication. The whole concept originated with the advent of the VLC i.e Visible Light Communication. The idea here is to think out of the radio bandwidth which we are so used to, that we actually use it in 99% of all our wireless communication, but the scenario is changing as Radio waves have some disadvantages like interference, low bandwidth etc. that need a thoughtful update or entire replacement, if need be, this is where the VLC comes in for the rescue. If we look at the electromagnetic spectrum we can see how small the bandwidth of Radio waves is and that there are still wide range of frequencies that we can use, in this case the Visible Light which falls between the ranges 350nm-750nm wavelength. Li-Fi uses this band of frequencies for bringing about the communication between two devices. Hence Li-Fi can effectively share the burden on current Wi-Fi and eventually replace it in many indoor places like Hospitals, Military bases, Offices etc. © 2017 IEEE.","Light Emitting Diodes; Light Fidelity (Li-Fi); Radio Waves; Visible Light Communication; Wireless Communications","Bandwidth; Data transfer; Light; Light emitting diodes; Radio waves; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Electromagnetic spectra; Existing problems; Feasible solution; Indoor communications; Light fidelity (Li Fi); Radio bandwidth; Wireless communications; Wireless fidelities; Visible light communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Then, the sink will collect more interference because of the slow-fading of signal, due to this, a higher outage probability and high energy consumption occurs. Underwater wireless communication is quite difficult because of the factors like propagation delay, small available bandwidth, strong signal attenuation, and interference from natural and man-made acoustic interferences. In underwater wireless acoustic communication all these factors depend on the frequency and distance. Higher frequency defines the worst case in terms of power consumption, and in terms of battery lifetime of the network. So in this work, we consider optimal distance between transmit nodes and receiver node to enhance the performance. The optimal power control schemes has been proposed in underwater wireless networks, of which the principle thought is to utilize distinctive power levels for enhancing the performance. By using this scheme, we get reduction of outage probability and enhancement of transmission capacity.

This requires their design to be based on some kind of reconfigurable techniques. Also, in cognitive applications, intelligent bandwidth allocation for efficient spectrum utilization requires altering the bandwidth within the same communication channel. Digital filters with non-uniform and varying bandwidths can be used to channelize different frequencies. Efficient designs of such filters are proposed in this paper. Frequency response masking (FRM)-based design is used, where the masking filters can be tuned to a desired set of frequencies by using a variable bandwidth (VBW) digital filter, configured as Farrow structure. For each of the chosen bandwidth, a corresponding masking filter response can be obtained, using the Farrow structure. A novel extension of FRM is proposed in this paper, using two approaches, to realize more than one sharp filter response from the same prototype linear-phase low-pass filter. In both approaches, the masking filters of the FRM filter are realized using Farrow structure. In the first approach, only a set of two Farrow structure filters are required to realize all the required channels. The channel selection is then carried out by varying a single parameter on each of the two masking filters. In the second approach, every channel is realized using a set of two Farrow structure filters and the channel is selected by means of hardware switching techniques. In addition to reconfigurability, hardware implementation complexity of Farrow structure-based VBW is lower compared to the direct FIR filter structure when designed for large set of bandwidths. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Farrow structure; Frequency response masking (FRM); Interpolation; Reconfigurable; Variable bandwidth filter","Bandpass filters; Bandwidth; Computer hardware; Digital filters; FIR filters; Frequency response; Hardware; Interpolation; Speech recognition; Wireless telecommunication systems; Farrow structure; Frequency response masking; Hardware implementations; Intelligent bandwidth; Reconfigurable; Spectrum utilization; Variable bandwidths; Wireless communication system; Low pass filters","Haridas, N.; Department of ECE, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: nisha_p120093ec@nitc.ac.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009726765

The tracking medium synchronizes consecutively, the acquired satellite signal with the code and carrier frequencies that are locally generated. To track these parameters Kalman filter is used.

In this method, secondary users are enabled to share the available bandwidth with the existing primary users. Two sets of orthogonal Gold codes are used to support the primary and secondary users simultaneously. Orthogonality between the spreading codes is lost due to non-zero cross correlation between the codes and timing synchronisation error in the uplink transmission, which causes interference among primary and secondary users. In this paper, a modified hybrid parallel/successive interference cancellation algorithm is proposed for the primary and secondary user base station receivers with multiple antennas, to suppress the interference among the users. Interferences among same group users are cancelled using parallel interference cancellation and the interferences between groups are cancelled using successive interference cancellation.

The objective of the proposed approach is to minimize the number of requests blocked in a dynamic multicast optical networks by minimizing the total resources (such as transceivers, splitters and wavelengths) used by the requests and simultaneously increase the bandwidth utilization. Since there are multiple wavelengths on a WDM optical fiber of fixed capacities, minimizing the number of wavelengths to be used is a variation of the bin packing problem. In the bin packing problem, multicast requests of different granularities or subwavelengths must be packed into a finite number of wavelength channels, in such a fashion that it minimizes the number of wavelengths used. In computational complexity theory, it is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. Therefore, we propose two heuristic approaches that provide the efficient resource utilization. These algorithms are called Multicast Traffic Grooming with Bin packing Best-Fit (MTG-BBF) and Multicast Traffic Grooming with Bin packing First-Fit (MTG-BFF). Both the algorithms are derived from standard Bin pack heuristic approach and we map our problem with such kind of approach. Our simulations demonstrated that both the algorithms significantly reduce the blocking probability (BP) compared to well known existing algorithms and MTG-BFF produces slightly better performance than MTG-BBF in the standard networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bin packing; Light-tree; Lightpath; Multicast Traffic Grooming; Splitter; Transceivers; Wavelength Division Multiplexing","Bandwidth; Bins; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; MESH networking; Multicasting; Multimedia services; Multiplexing; Optical fibers; Transceivers; Wavelength division multiplexing; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Bin packing; Light tree; Lightpaths; Multi cast traffic grooming; Splitter; Blocking probability","Pradhan, A.K.; National Institute of Technology, NIT, Department of Computer Science and EngineeringIndia",,"Elsevier B.V.",15734277,,,,"English","Opt.

Copper adhesive tape, silver conductive ink, and conductive paper are available in the market and are used as radiating material in the design of the textile antenna. In this paper, antennas are designed for 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz with frequency switching between these two frequencies. Three switches are used for frequency reconfigurability.

Dynamic power in digital programmable CMOS-based processors depends on the switching activity. Specifically in its subcomponents like FIR filter, power consumption can be directly related to the node switching activity. Minimization of power consumption can be done by reducing the transitions or dissimilarities in filter coefficients. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been found to be very effective for optimized FIR filter design because of nonlinear, nondifferentiable, multimodal and nonconvex nature of the associated optimization problem. However, all the existing evolutionary optimization-based design techniques aim at meeting the frequency domain specifications without concentrating on minimizing power consumption. In the present work, a novel EA, i.e., hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm, has been proposed and further applied for FIR filter design. The filter design task aims at satisfying the dual objectives of meeting the desired frequency domain specifications and power minimization. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial bee colony; Evolutionary optimization; FIR filters; FPGA; Power minimization","Bandpass filters; Digital integrated circuits; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency domain analysis; Integrated circuit design; Optimization; Specifications; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Evolutionary optimizations; Experimental validations; Optimization problems; Power minimization; Switching activities; FIR filters","Ghosh, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, NITIndia; email: aceghosh@gmail.com",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009821273

Digital predistortion (DPD) is a technique used to compensate for the nonlinear distortion without compromising its efficiency.

The precision of spectral detection is increased when the number of sub-bands in the filter bank is increased, this increases the computational complexity of the filter bank structure. We suggest a multistage filter bank structure to reduce the computational complexity. Spectrum detection is done effectively in filter banks by proper choice of prototype filter with specified sub-band attenuation. The sub-bands detected in coarser granularity bands are sensed with finer granularity bands for precise spectral detection depending on the predefined threshold and probability of false alarm. The remaining sub-bands are not sensed further which in turn reduces the computational complexity. Through simulations it is shown that spectrum detection with multistage granularity bands maintains bandwidth efficiency and reliability in spectrum detection even at low SNR.

We specifically look at caching of HTTPS traffic which has thus far not received much attention. We first look at client side caching on smartphones in mobile web scenarios to evaluate the potential for bandwidth savings. Our analysis based on user logs reveals that app traffic dominates browser traffic at 82.7% and HTTPS traffic dominates HTTP traffic at 82.3%. There is around 15% redundancy in this traffic, however much of this redundancy does not lend itself to practical savings since app logic or server cache configurations cannot be controlled. Given the negative result of above approach, we shifted our attention to infrastructure side caching (wired) in an organizational setting. Analysis of our logs indicate that HTTPS accounts for 91.6% of all considered traffic and YouTube accounts for 82% of this HTTPS traffic. We found that there is some amount of redundancy in this traffic and hence potential for bandwidth savings. However proxying HTTPS traffic is challenging given that the proxy has to act as a man in the middle of a secure transaction. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new architecture that serves only insensitive HTTPS traffic from the proxy. We validate the feasibility of this approach via an implementation. A trace driven simulation shows that one can realize bandwidth savings of between 13–17% with our architecture. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Bandwidth; Redundancy; Web crawler; Bandwidth savings; Cache configurations; Client side caching; Man in the middle; Measurement study; Organizational setting; Secure transactions; Trace driven simulation; HTTP","Chebrolu, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT BombayIndia; email: chebrolu@cse.iitb.ac.in","Uhlig S.Amann J.Kaafar M.A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319543277,,,"English","Lect.

Traditional design methods treat the digital IIR filter design as a single-objective optimization problem by taking into account the minimization of magnitude response error only and lack in considering the linear phase response error and the order of the filter. The aim of this paper was to design an IIR filter in multi-objective framework by equally considering the minimization of magnitude response error, the linear phase response error and the order of the filter. Firstly, the CSO algorithm is applied for digital IIR filter design. In order to start with a better solution set, the opposition-based learning strategy is then incorporated. To further improve the performance of CSO for designing stable digital IIR filters, the DE optimization algorithm is combined with CSO hence producing an integrated algorithm called multi-objective cat swarm and differential evolution algorithm (MOCSO-DE) which has the capability to explore and exploit the solution search space locally as well as globally. The developed integrated algorithm is effectively applied for the designing of the digital IIR low-pass (LP), high-pass (HP), band-pass (BP) and band-stop (BS) filters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed integrated algorithm, the computational results are compared with some well-established algorithms and it is observed that the developed algorithm is superior or at least comparable to other algorithms in getting better magnitude response and linear phase response together with lowest filter order and can also be implemented for the higher-order filter designs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cat swarm optimization; Differential evolution; Digital infinite impulse response filter; Filter design; Multi-objective optimization; Multiparameter optimization; Opposition-based learning","Bandpass filters; Design; Errors; Evolutionary algorithms; Impulse response; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Differential Evolution; Filter designs; Multi-parameter optimizations; Opposition-based learning; Swarm optimization; IIR filters","Dhaliwal, K.K.; Department of Electrical and Instrumentation Engineering, Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: Kamal_dhaliwal12@yahoo.co.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009775067

Efficient usage of energy is a key issue in WSN application such as target tracking. Another important criterion is a tracking accuracy that can be achieved by using appropriate tracking mechanism. Because of the special characteristic of WSN, there is a trade-off between tracking accuracy and power consumption. Our aim is to improve tracking accuracy as well as provide energy-efficient solution by integrating the concept of clustering and prediction techniques. This paper presents Energy-Efficient Constant Gain Kalman Filter based Tracking (EECGKFT) algorithm to optimize the energy usage and to increase the tracking accuracy. There is also a need to collect data from network having a mobile Base Station (BS). Hence, performance of proposed algorithm is analyzed for a static BS and also for mobile BS. The results depict that proposed algorithm performs better compared to the existing algorithms in energy efficiency and prediction accuracy.

For effective use of bandwidth the capacity of these optical fibers is divided into several channels. Any damage to an optical fiber will affect the data communication on the associated channels ultimately results in data loss between the terminals. Therefore a survivable virtual mapping is required over the physical topology which can still connect the terminals in case of a link failure. Here popular ant colony optimization is used to determine the optimal paths in a survivable virtual topology. Simulation studies on a five node and a ten node network reveal the determination of virtual optimal path between all the nodes considering link-cost and hop-count. The computational time required to establish communication between the nodes of these networks using the real physical link and proposed virtual link are reported. It is observed that though the virtual connection take either equal or more time than the physical link, it can able to establish the connection even in case of any physical link failure. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Ant colony optimization; Optical networks; Survivable virtual topology","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Fiber optic networks; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Problem solving; Soft computing; Topology; Computational time; Data-communication; Link failures; Optimal paths; Physical topology; Simulation studies; Virtual connections; Virtual topologies; Optical fiber communication","Kumari, K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology JaipurIndia; email: meelkaush@gmail.com","Das K.N.Pant M.Deep K.Bansal J.C.Lal A.K.Garg H.Nagar A.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811033247,,,"English","Adv.

Adaptive FIR filter with Block LMS algorithm is basically used to reduce the power consumption. In this paper a distributed arithmetic (DA) is used for implementation of BLMS algorithm. It is used to calculate the inner product by shifting and accumulating of partial products. These are stored in look up table (LUT). DA based BLMS algorithm is used to reduce the area. The area is reduced as both convolution operation and correlation operation is performed by using the same LUT. The distributed arithmetic based design uses a look up table sharing for computation of the weight increment terms and filter outputs of BLMS algorithm. This results in less use of adders which is a major component of DA based structures. The LUT based weight updating for BLMS algorithm is suggested in the paper. For the implementation of BLMS adaptive digital filter, we have developed a parallel architecture. Parallel processing is used to increase the speed. Parallel processing results in high throughput. It requires less number of LUT access for every output than the existing structure, for higher block size. In the design, number of adders does not increase with filter order. The number of flip flops also does not dependent on block size. The advantage of the structure is reduction in its delay and area delay product (ADP). The adaptive filter will be multiplierless, which reduces the complexity of the circuit. We have also observed increase in its PSNR. Thus a DA based implementation of adaptive FIR filter using BLMS algorithm is area efficient and highly computational. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive filters; Block LMS; Distributed Arithmetic; VLSI","Adaptive filtering; Adders; Bandpass filters; Computational efficiency; Digital signal processing; FIR filters; Flip flop circuits; Parallel architectures; Table lookup; Adaptive digital filters; Adaptive FIR Filters; Block LMS; Block lms algorithms; Correlation operation; Distributed arithmetic; Parallel processing; VLSI; Adaptive filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Progressively, often, data needs to be shared among the unreliable entities. In this field, one interesting and common problem occurs when two parties want to secretly determine the intersection or cardinality of intersection of their respective private sets. PSI or its variants are ideal to solve the aforementioned problems. Existing solutions of mPSI and mPSI-CA mainly use trusted third party to achieve fairness. However, in real life, the unconditional trust is fraught with security risks as the trusted third party may be unfaithful or corrupted. As a consequence, construction of an efficient mPSI-CA preserving fairness remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we address this issue by employing an off-line third party, called arbiter, who is assumed to be semi-trusted in the sense that he does not have access to the private information of the entities while he will follow the protocol honestly. In this work, we design a construction of fair and efficient mPSI-CA utilizing Bloom filter. Our mPSI-CA is proven to be secure in the random oracle model (ROM) and achieves linear communication and computation overheads.

It is based on pre-computing and storing the filter partial products in lookup tables (LUTs). In contrast to fixed coefficients filter, an adaptive filter requires each stored partial product to be updated time-to-time. This paper presents a new strategy for DA based adaptive filter using offset binary coding (OBC) technique. The proposed strategy eliminates two oldest sample and allows possible decomposition of LUT into four sub-LUTs. Hence, the proposed approach provides significant improvement in throughput at the cost of few 2-to-1 multiplexers. Synthesis results have shown that the proposed scheme occupies almost similar area and improves the throughput by several fold. For instance, a 32- tap adaptive filter with the proposed implementation produces nearly 1.8 MSPS (million samples per second) more throughput as compared to the best existing scheme. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Distributed arithmetic (DA); Finite impulse response (FIR) filter; Least mean square (LMS); Look-up table (LUT)","Adaptive filtering; Bandpass filters; FIR filters; Impulse response; Table lookup; Throughput; VLSI circuits; Distributed arithmetic; Efficient implementation; Least mean square (LMS); LMS adaptive filters; Look up table; Lookup tables (LUTs); Offset binary coding techniques; VLSI implementation; Adaptive filters","Khan, M.T.; Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: tasleem@iitg.ernet.in","Kaushik B.K.Dasgupta S.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811074691,,,"English","Commun.

However sudden high peaks in OFDM signal envelope lead to high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Enhanced values of PAPR result into complex RF amplifier circuit with reduced efficiency. There are various methods available for PAPR reduction, out of them partial transmit sequence (PTS) is most effective proven choice for PAPR reduction. However PTS technique requires cumbersome searching of all possible phase factors to find optimal phase factor which produces lowest PAPR, the information regarding optimal phase set used at the transmitter need to be sent to the receiver as side information (SI) for decoding purpose, however transmitting SI requires additional transmission bandwidth thus reducing overall bandwidth efficiency. To reduce the exhaustive searching genetic algorithm (GA) could be used with PTS leading to GA-PTS system. In this paper a GA-PTS system is proposed which uses novel octagonal geometry for constellation extension purpose. This scheme does not require transmission of any side information for decoding purpose at receiver and at the same time GA-PTS system reduces the required number of searches. Simulations are presented to show that proposed scheme provides similar PAPR performance as conventional PTS but without need of SI transmission at reduced number of searches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","C-PTS; GA-PTS; OFDM; PAPR; Side information","Bandwidth; Decoding; Efficiency; Frequency division multiplexing; Genetic algorithms; Radio frequency amplifiers; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bandwidth efficiency; Constellation extensions; High speed transmission; PAPR; Partial transmit sequence; Peak to average power ratio; Side information; Transmission bandwidth; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Joshi, A.; Department of ECE, Jaypee Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: 20.alok@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982171768

VANETs encourage researchers to create safety and comfort applications that will lead to intelligent transport systems. Conventional ad hoc routing methods may cause ooding of packets to find routes in a VANET. Hence, finding a route from the source to the destination vehicle by local broadcast techniques in densely populated urban areas may create a broadcast storm and network bandwidth is unnecessarily wasted to discover routes between source and destination vehicles. In this paper, an efficient routing protocol (ERP) is proposed to utilize the network bandwidth efficiently by avoiding unnecessary rebroadcast. This new protocol finds a minimum connected dominating set of vehicles (MCDSV) and treats them as a virtual backbone for communication in VANETs. Vehicles in the virtual backbone act as forwarders and are responsible for local broadcasting in the network. Vehicles that are not in the MCDSV are not allowed to broadcast packets as forwarders and hence the bandwidth utilization is minimized. The proposed protocol has been implemented in NS2 and its performance is compared with other routing protocols for packet delivery ratio, control overhead ratio, and average end-to-end delay. © TÜBİTAK.","Minimum connected dominating set of vehicles; Unicast routing; Vehicular ad hoc networks","Ad hoc networks; Bandwidth; Broadcasting; Intelligent systems; Internet protocols; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Routing protocols; Vehicles; Average end-to-end delays; Band-width utilization; Efficient routing; Intelligent transport systems; Minimum connected dominating set; Packet delivery ratio; Reactive routing protocol; Unicast routing; Vehicular ad hoc networks","Sivakumar, T.; Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering and Technology, Pondicherry UniversityIndia; email: tsivakumar@yahoo.com",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020754507

In this paper we propose a dual source-filter model similar to the source-filter model of speech to approximate the generation process of snore audio. The first filter models the vocal tract from lungs to the point of obstruction with white noise excitation from the lungs. The second filter models the vocal tract from the obstruction point to the lips/nose with impulse train excitation which represents vibrations at the point of obstruction.

MIMO technique is defined as the technique containing multiple transmitter antennas and multiple receiver antennas. MIMO systems can provide a potentially very high capacity that, in many cases, grows approximately linear with the number of antennas. This technique increases the data rate, while OFDM saves the bandwidth and reduces fading. In this scheme, the entire signal orthogonally overlaps in a frequency domain that saves the bandwidth. IDMA scheme is based on interleaving technique. It distinguishes the users by chip level interleaving principle. IDMA scheme is better than any other available multiple access schemes available for underwater communication. We simulate the MIMO-OFDM with IDMA scheme to reduce the channel noise and fading issues. This scheme is able to serve as a primer for mitigating the fading issues in future underwater wireless communication.

When OFDM signal with high PAPR passed through high power amplifiers (HPA), it requires a large back-off to operate in linear region, this leads to large dynamic range of HPA, such HPA are costly and complex with poor efficiency. Partial transmit sequence (PTS) is one of the most promising techniques for PAPR reduction. The major drawback of this technique is it requires exhaustive searching of all possible and allowable phase factors to find the optimal phase factor with lowest PAPR. This information is to be sent to a receiver as side information (SI) for decoding purpose. Sending SI puts additional burden on the transmission bandwidth thus reducing bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, a novel constellation extension-based PTS is proposed which uses novel octagonal geometry (OM-PTS) for mapping purpose. This scheme does not require transmission of any side information for decoding purpose at the receiver. Simulations are presented to show that the proposed scheme provides the same PAPR performance as conventional PTS but without need of SI transmission.

Hyperspectral datasets contain large number of contiguous spectral bands with a narrow spectral bandwidth which enables identification of peculiar absorption features for distinguishing different type of soils. The potential of Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) data was tested for distinguishing black and red soils in the ICRISAT area near Hyderabad, Telangana. The AVIRIS-NG data captured in 432 narrow contiguous bands (346–2505 nm) with spectral sampling of 5 nm bandwidth and a 4m ground pixel size was used in this study. The dataset was first spectrally subsetted by identification and removal of bad bands and was atmospherically corrected by converting it to surface reflectance using FLAASH. The data was finally georeferenced using the Internal Geometry Module (IGM) parameters. Optimal spectral bands from the reflectance data were selected on the basis of different characteristics of various soils. Data dimensionality reduction technique Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) was also performed to extract noise free components. Total five classes including red and black soils were considered for land cover classification. Pixel based classification techniques such as Spectral Angle Mapper(SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were performed on the reflectance as well as MNF transformed data. SVM was also performed on data containing noise free MNF components and the selected optimal spectral bands. In the resultant classified output of reflectance data, SVM classifier provided higher accuracy and was able to classify black and red soil in a better way than SAM technique. The results also suggested that use of MNF components and specific spectral bands altogether improvised the classification of black and red soil. © 2017 ACRS.

Instantaneous pitch period and amplitude of glottal vibrations directly from the speech waveform may not give an accurate estimation of jitter and shimmer. In this paper, the significance of epochs (glottal closure instants) and strength of excitation (SoE) derived from the zero-frequency filter (ZFF) are exploited to discriminate the voice disorder and normal speech. Pitch epoch derived from ZFF is used to compute the jitter, and SoE derived around each epoch is used compute the shimmer. The derived epoch-based features are analyzed on the some of the voice disorders like Parkinson's disease, vocal fold paralysis, cyst, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The significance of proposed epoch-based features for discriminating normal and pathological voices is analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art methods using a support vector machine classifier.

This BigData is frequently and repeatedly downloaded across the world on various devices, where a mobile device became a first choice. Hence, we focus on how effectively a BigData can be delivered to the end user using cache-based approach in mobile networks. The main contributions of our work are threefold. First, we present an architecture of BigCache along with the cache decision system and cache replacement process for rapid access to BigData at large extent in mobile networks. Second, we propose three different caching schemes, designated as request-based caching scheme, priority-based caching scheme and scale-based caching scheme in BigCache.

Firstly, the FOD design problem is formulated as an optimization problem using the transfer function of lattice wave digital filter. Then, three optimization algorithms, namely, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) are applied to determine the optimal LWDF coefficients. The realization of FOD using LWD structure increases the design accuracy, as only N number of coefficients are to be optimized for Nth order FOD. Finally, two design examples of 3rd and 5th order lattice wave digital fractional order differentiator (LWDFOD) are demonstrated to justify the design accuracy. The performance analysis of the proposed design is carried out based on magnitude response, absolute magnitude error (dB), root mean square (RMS) magnitude error, arithmetic complexity, convergence profile and computation time. Simulation results are attained to show the comparison of the proposed LWDFOD with the published works and it is observed that an improvement of 29% is obtained in the proposed design. The proposed LWDFOD approximates the ideal FOD and surpasses the existing ones reasonably well in mid and high frequency range, thereby making the proposed LWDFOD a promising technique for the design of digital FODs. © 2016 ISA","Cuckoo search algorithm; Fractional order differentiator; Genetic algorithm; Lattice wave digital filters; Minimum multiplier; Particle swarm optimization","Bandpass filters; Design; Frequency multiplying circuits; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Molecular dynamics; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Arithmetic complexity; Cuckoo search algorithms; Fractional order differentiator; Lattice wave digital filters; Minimum multiplier; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Performance analysis; Digital filters","Kumar, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bennett UniversityIndia; email: manjeetchhillar@gmail.com",,"ISA - Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society",00190578,,ISATA,,"English","ISA Trans",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008705096

This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for efficient retrieval of data from huge datasets using combined approach of clustering and frequent pattern analysis using maximum frequent transaction (MFT) set algorithm based on similarity of transactions provided by a novel data structure called Bloomier matrix filter (BMF). In the proposed model clustering the metadata file is done on two levels. The first level of cluster is a base cluster which is created in an offline mode, while uploading the data based on keyword using tf-idf and second level of cluster is a derived cluster which is created in an online mode, while downloading the data. Frequent transactions are generated based on the run time statistics of the transaction provided by the Bloomier matrix filter analysis. Based on the run time statistics of the BMF the dynamic cluster is derived. We have implemented the model in a cloud environment and the experimental results shows that our approach is more efficient than the existing search technology and increases throughput by handling more number of queries efficiently with reduced latency.

Raisoni Institute of Engineering Technology, Pune, India","Least Mean Square (LMS) and Normalized-Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithms are very popular and frequently used algorithms for noise cancellation in speech. But selecting the step size for updating the weight of adaptive filter is the big issue in LMS and NLMS algorithms. So as to meet disagreeing requirements of quick convergence and less MSE, step size needs to be correctly controlled. Along with step size, length of adaptive filter also plays major role in the effective noise cancellation. These two factors greatly affect the performance of the ANC. To get the best possible solution, a variety of trials of filter length and step size are required. The main motivation behind the development of proposed High Performance Self Tuning (HPST) adaptive filter algorithm is to adaptively determine the step size. The selection of length of adaptive filter is based on the distance between two microphones in the ANC system. The proposed algorithm works very well, as shown in the experiments which are carried out on NOIZEUS speech corpus as well as actually recorded noisy speech signals. Results indicate that proposed algorithm is superior to referred algorithms in terms of Mean-Square-Error (MSE), Peak-Signal to Noise ratio (PSNR), convergence time and complexity. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

The low-rate DoS attack against the application servers is considered in this paper with the motive to develop an efficient defense technique against the low-rate DoS attack. Among different defense techniques, the Improved Random Time Queue Blocking (IRTQB) performs better than other methods. IRTQB performs similar to Random Time Queue Blocking (RTQB), but it selectively chooses the blocking interval requests only from the potential attackers and discards them. However, the differentiation of the attacker requests from the legitimate users' is not always efficient as only the source IP addresses and the record timestamp are considered. This can be improved when considering more complex set of features. Hence, in this paper, the Advanced Random Time Queue Blocking (ARTQB) scheme is proposed by additionally employing Bandwidth utilization of attacker and legitimate user in IRTQB. ARTQB defines Spatial Similarity Metric (SSM) between the requests in terms of source IP addresses, the record timestamp and the bandwidth. Thus the defense of the application server against the low-rate DoS attack is be improved than IRTQB. Experimental results show that the proposed ARTQB performs better protection of Low-Rate DoS Attack against Application Servers (LoR- DAS) by reducing the attack efficiency and attack impact on the server.","ARTQB; IRTQB; Low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS); RTQB; Spatial similarity metric (SSM)","Bandwidth; Computer crime; Internet protocols; Network security; Queueing theory; ARTQB; Denial of Service; IRTQB; RTQB; Spatial similarity; Denial-of-service attack","Kavitha, R.; Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for WomenIndia; email: jayabal.kavitha@gmail.com",,"Femto Technique Co., Ltd.",1816353X,,,,"English","Int.

For non real-time, it does not care for the Quality of Service (QoS) performance. But for real-time services, the CAC cares for the QoS by keeping the sufficient bandwidth throughout the transmission. Bandwidth determines the system capacity and speed. In this paper, a new Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based CAC algorithm is proposed for increasing the number of admission and reducing the admission of less compressed calls. For this task the various codecs such as G.711, G.729, G.723, G.726, AMR, EVRC, and iLBC have been taken. AHP is applied among them to take the right decision and it produces the ranking order. That rank helps to save more bandwidth and increases the throughput (Packets per second). This task is carried out by taking the criteria like bandwidth, packetization delay, and compression ratio of each individual codecs. The ultimate aim of this TACA is to give better QoS performance for real-time services and increase the system throughput for Voice over Internet Protocol. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Analytic hierarchy process; Call admission control; Quality of service; Voice over internet protocol","Analytic hierarchy process; Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Compression ratio (machinery); Congestion control (communication); Hierarchical systems; Information services; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Mobile telecommunication systems; Process control; Quality control; Real time systems; Telecommunication services; Throughput; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Packets per seconds; Qos performance; Real time service; System Capacity; System throughput; Voice over Internet protocol; Wireless communications; Quality of service","Newton, P.C.; Department of Computer Science, Government Arts College, Karur-Dt, India; email: calduwel@yahoo.com","Singh V.K.Tiwari S.Mishra K.K.Bhatia S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811037696,,,"English","Adv.

A key characteristics of distributed storage is that data are stored in remote servers across a network. Thus, network resources especially communication links are an expensive and non-trivial resource which should be optimized as well. In this paper, we present a simulation based study of the network characteristics of a distributed storage network in the light of several allocation patterns. By varying the allocation patterns we have demonstrated the interdependence between network bandwidth, defined in terms of link capacity and allocation pattern using network throughput as a metric. Recognizing the importance of network resources as an important cost metric, we intend to solve an optimization problem based on minimizing both the storage cost and the cost of network resources. The results of this optimization problem will determine how both storage and network optimization can be performed jointly so that a highly robust yet cost effective storage solution could be developed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Distributed storage allocation; Genetic algorithm; Network and storage optimized storage system","Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data storage equipment; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Problem solving; Cost-effective storages; Distributed storage; Distributed storage networks; Intelligent modeling; Network characteristics; Network optimization; Optimization problems; Storage systems; Digital storage","Chattopadhyay, S.; Department of Information Technology, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: samirancju@gmail.com","Mandal J.K.Dutta P.Mukhopadhyay S.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811064296,,,"English","Commun.

In this paper, an edge aware geometric filter (GF) is proposed for speckle reduction. The behaviour of conventional GF is approximated using commonly used functions like unit step. These approximations help in identifying the natural relationship between GF and other existing spatially adaptive filters. Subsequently, the modifications in GF framework are proposed to take the advantage of edge characteristics. The proposed filter requires almost no parameter tuning and provides good quality outputs for synthetic as well as real ultrasound images.

Therefore, remote sensing based techniques are being used extensively in glaciological studies as it offers the comprehensive and repetitive monitoring in a cost effective manner. Recently, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) tool (Leprince et al., 2007) which is based on image matching method of optical images has gained popularity for the estimation of glacier surface velocity and has proved to be robust and effective. For denoising the glacier surface velocity estimates, Non-Local Means (NLM) filter has been incorporated in COSI-Corr. However, to discard/replace erroneous values, user has to manually define the threshold to discard/replace erroneous values. Although the NLM filter in COSI-Corr gives smooth estimates, but it has been observed that the filtered values deviate from the original ones. Therefore, the main purpose of this study has been to find an optimal filter for obtaining smooth estimates while preserving the original. Various spatial domain filters such as mean filter, low-pass filter, adaptive filter and statistical filters have been applied and evaluated in this study to obtain smooth glacier surface velocity estimates. The comparative evaluation of these filters showed that the application of statistical filter with multipliers 1, 2 and 4 in sequential order followed by 3 x 3 mean filter provided close match with the original estimates.","COSI-Corr; Filtering; Glacier ice; Ice velocity","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Adaptive optics; Bandpass filters; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Filtration; Geometrical optics; Ice; Image denoising; Optical correlation; Remote sensing; Space applications; Space optics; Velocity; Comparative evaluations; COSI-Corr; Glacier ice; Glacier surface velocity; Ice velocity; Non local means (NLM); Sequential ordering; Spatial domain filter; Low pass filters",,,"Asian Association on Remote Sensing",,,,,"English","Asian Conf.

The SRF PLL can be completely implemented in software with and without pre-filters. The pre-filters are band pass and high pass filters these can be used to reduce harmonics present in the input and high pass filter alone can reduce the dc offset present in the input.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an important experimental technique that can be used to optimize the performance of these devices at the design stage. Further, EIS can also be used for non-invasive, in-situ diagnostics of device performance, while operational. While EIS is a powerful technique, the instrumentation required for implementation can be bulky and the time for analysis could also become unacceptable, particularly for online applications. The proposed work is an investigation and development of a rapid impedance measurement technology using large bandwidth and short duration diagnostic signals. The key concept behind the approach is the use of a particular definition of instantaneous frequency in tandem with chirp signals for testing. The instantaneous frequency definition allows one-to-one time frequency mapping and the chirp signal incorporates a wide bandwidth of frequencies. As a result, a novel impedance plot qualitatively, and largely quantitatively, matching the corresponding EIS plot is generated. Consequently, any diagnostic approach based on EIS can potentially be realized using the proposed approach. The impedance plots are generated in a very short time making the approach amenable for online applications. In-silico validation of the proposed method on few equivalent circuits of electrochemical systems is presented in this work; future work will include experimental validation of the technique on real electrochemical systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Batteries; Chirp analysis; Diagnosis; Impedance","Bandwidth; Diagnosis; Electric impedance; Electric impedance measurement; Equivalent circuits; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Solar cells; Chirp analysis; Diagnostic approach; Electrochemical systems; Experimental techniques; Experimental validations; Impedance measurement; Instantaneous frequency; On-line applications; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","Rengaswamy, R.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: raghur@iitm.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",00981354,,CCEND,,"English","Comput.

It provides the viewer a new sense of presence and immersion. Compared to conventional rectilinear video (2D or 3D), 360° video poses a new and difficult set of engineering challenges on video processing and delivery. Enabling comfortable and immersive user experience requires very high video quality and very low latency, while the large video file size poses a challenge to delivering 360° video in a quality manner at scale. Conventionally, 360° video represented in equirectangular or other projection formats can be encoded as a single standards-compliant bitstream using existing video codecs such as H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC. Such method usually needs very high bandwidth to provide an immersive user experience. While at the client side, much of such high bandwidth and the computational power used to decode the video are wasted because the user only watches a small portion (i.e., viewport) of the entire picture. Viewport dependent 360°video processing and delivery approaches spend more bandwidth on the viewport than on non-viewports and are therefore able to reduce the overall transmission bandwidth. This paper proposes a dual buffer segment scheduling algorithm for viewport adaptive streaming methods to reduce latency when switching between high quality viewports in 360° video streaming. The approach decouples the scheduling of viewport segments and non-viewport segments to ensure the viewport segment requested matches the latest user head orientation. A base layer buffer stores all lower quality segments, and a viewport buffer stores high quality viewport segments corresponding to the most recent viewer's head orientation. The scheduling scheme determines viewport requesting time based on the buffer status and the head orientation. This paper also discusses how to deploy the proposed scheduling design for various viewport adaptive video streaming methods. The proposed dual buffer segment scheduling method is implemented in an end-to-end tile based 360° viewports adaptive video streaming platform, where the entire 360° video is divided into a number of tiles, and each tile is independently encoded into multiple quality level representations. The client requests different quality level representations of each tile based on the viewer's head orientation and the available bandwidth, and then composes all tiles together for rendering. The simulation results verify that the proposed dual buffer segment scheduling algorithm reduces the viewport switch latency, and utilizes available bandwidth more efficiently. As a result, a more consistent immersive 360° video viewing experience can be presented to the user. © 2017 SPIE.","360° video; DASH; HEVC; Segment Scheduling; Video Streaming","Bandwidth; Communication channels (information theory); Image processing; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Video streaming; Virtual reality; Adaptive video streaming; Available bandwidth; Computational power; DASH; Engineering challenges; HEVC; Transmission bandwidth; Virtual reality devices; Video signal processing",,"Tescher A.G.","SPIE",0277786X,9781510612495,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034744881

Research efforts relevant to these paradigms are focused on the mode selection policies which decide when to switch from CR mode (i.e., opportunistic vacant spectrum access mode) to the RFEH mode (i.e., battery charging using ambient RF energy) and vice-versa. So far, very little attention has been paid to the dual but competing task of frequency band selection in CR and RFEH modes under partially observable environment in the decentralized wireless networks. Furthermore, the need of tunable bandwidth frequency band access for CRs and lower subband switching cost (SSC) for energy efficient implementation have made the design of the decision making policy (DMP) more challenging. In this paper, a new CR-RFEH DMP has been proposed for RFEH enabled CR terminals in the decentralized wireless networks. The proposed DMP consists of three sub-units: 1) Bayesian approach based tunable Thompson sampling algorithm for subband statistics estimation, 2) Thompson sampling algorithm based subband access scheme exploiting the past collision events to minimize collisions among CRs, and 3) Mode selection scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed DMP offers 10–35% improvement in the throughput of the decentralized network and 40–90% reduction in the number of subband switchings compared to existing DMPs. The simulation results are then validated using real radio signals on the proposed USRP testbed. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit algorithms; Radio frequency energy harvesting; Thompson sampling","Bandwidth; Bayesian networks; Decision making; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Learning algorithms; Radio systems; Radio waves; Sampling; Secondary batteries; Wireless networks; Bayesian approaches; Decentralized networks; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Partially observable environments; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Thompson samplings; Cognitive radio","Darak, S.J.; Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, IIITIndia; email: Sumit@iiitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Inc.",10512004,,DSPRE,,"English","Digital Signal Process Rev J",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987941268

But in practice, the measurements could be randomly delayed. In the literature, the problem has been examined and solution is provided by restricting the maximum number of delay to one or two time steps. This technical note develops an approach to deal with the filtering problems with an arbitrary number of delays in measurement. Pursuing this objective, traditional Bayesian approximation to nonlinear filtering problem is modified by reformulating the expressions of mean and covariances which appear during the measurement update. We use the cubature quadrature rule to evaluate the multivariate integral expressions for the mean vector and the covariance matrix which appear in the developed filtering algorithm. We compare the new algorithm which accounts for delay with the existing CQKF heuristics on two different examples and demonstrate how accounting for a random delay improves the filtering performance. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bayesian framework of filtering; cubature quadrature Kalman filter; nonlinear filtering; random delay in measurements","Bandpass filters; Covariance matrix; Digital control systems; Nonlinear filtering; Bayesian frameworks; Delayed measurements; Discrete - time systems; Filtering performance; Measurement updates; Non-linear filtering problems; Quadrature Kalman filters; Random delay; Discrete time control systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189286,,IETAA,,"English","IEEE Trans Autom Control",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009911249

Digital mammogram analysis is one of the techniques which helps in determining severity of breast cancer within the context of medical image analysis. In this work, a novel technique using steerable co-occurrence features and the independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed. Our method is evaluated using 1000 mammogram images and can efficiently classify normal, benign and malignant classes with a promising performance of 88.60% accuracy, using only ten features. The proposed method is completely automatic and it does not require any segmentation technique in the breast region. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.
