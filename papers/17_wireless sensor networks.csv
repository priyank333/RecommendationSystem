The term coverage is strongly correlated with the Lifetime of the network. Improving the network lifetime therefore enhances the sensing task of any network. The work takes up two techniques for improving the lifetime of the linear iterative regression based clustered network. As the energy of the cluster head drains below a threshold due to the traffic carried, the cluster member of the dead heading node can be allocated to some existing eligible cluster heads in the network so that the data sensed by these nodes can still be communicated to the sink. Alternately the allocation of secondary cluster head can be done for the aggregation of data which serves for improvement in lifetime of the network. With exhaustive simulation and evaluated results the performance of the two schemes are compared using throughput, Network lifetime and residual energy and it shows that the secondary cluster head allocation scheme is better in performance improvement of the network with the lifetime improvement of 22.8% and throughput improvement of 18.6% as compared to that of the cluster member allocation scheme. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Cluster head; Cluster member; Clustered network; Network coverage; Network lifetime; Residual energy; Throughput,Iterative methods; Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Throughput; Cluster head; Cluster member; Clustered networks; Network coverage; Network lifetime; Residual energy; Wireless sensor networks,"Joshitha, K.L.; Sri Sairam Engineering CollegeIndia; email: lakshmijoshitha@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039556715

The critical issue in WSNs is represented by the limited availability of energy within the network and hence optimizing energy consumption is very important. One important existing technique used to prolong the network lifetime of WSN is the Energy Minimization Scheme (EMS) using N-Policy Model (NPM) based on queue threshold but this technique increases mean delay. This paper proposes a Modified Energy Minimization Scheme (MEMS) which reduces the mean delay and average energy consumption of individual nodes in the cluster based heterogeneous sensor network using queue threshold based on M/D/1 Priority Queueing Model (PQM) in order to prolong the network lifetime. The expression for the optimal value of queue threshold for which the node consumes minimum energy using PQM is also derived. Results show that the mean delay is highly reduced in PQM when compared to the NPM and the trade-off exist between the average energy consumption and mean delay is explored. We perform simulations and the results obtained show that the simulation results match with the analytical results thus validating the accuracy of the approach. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Energy; Mean delay; NPM; PQM; Queue threshold,Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Queueing theory; Sensor nodes; Analytical results; Communication infrastructure; Diverse locations; Energy; Energy minimization; Heterogeneous sensor networks; Mean delays; Queue threshold; Wireless sensor networks,"Jayarajan, P.; Department of ECE, Sri Krishna College of TechnologyIndia; email: pjayarajan@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039544513

In this paper we focus on designing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based system, which can efficiently conserve the energy of class rooms and labs. We have identified temperature, light, pressure sensors to be utilized for this application. Infra Red receiver and transmitter is used to detect an event whether a person is leaving the room or not. Server room is checked for humidity, temperature, smoke by an integrated sensor, which sends the sensed data to the cloud. So all the sensors send the data periodically to the cloud, which processes the collected data and send the triggered response to the necessary output device and message the facility manager to take administrative actions. The status of each room in each floor is ultimately received at the central monitoring station at the ground floor of the building. The proposed system is designed in such a manner, it can be replicated cost-efficiently in multiple buildings within a campus by using low cost sensors and with the existing communication devices. Therefore this Green Campus System (GCS) design based on wireless sensor networks help in meeting the target of sustainable cities by reducing the overall energy consumption and improving the efficiency in the energy resource management. © 2017 IEEE.",Energy conservation in buildings; Wireless sensor network,Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Floors; Historic preservation; Administrative action; Carbon foot prints; Central monitoring stations; Communication device; Educational institutions; Energy resource managements; In-buildings; Sustainable cities; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"GHTC - IEEE Glob.

Agriculture has to tackle many problems like changing climate, water shortage, changing soil quality, etc. Due to the increasing demand for cereals and other crops for daily usage by the consumers there is a need for smarter implementation of irrigation and also develop farming methods that alter the basic eco systems and is less harmful to other creatures. India is one of highest crop producing countries all over the world. At the same time, India is facing the challenge of farmers committing suicide because of crop failure and debt. Most of the land in India is still being used for agriculture purposes. Still there exists several places that uses very primitive methods for irrigation, fertilization etc. This leads to the reduction in the crop yield and eventually less income for the farmers. This paper discusses the design and development of an IoT framework that helps farmers to improvise their methods of farming and also make the best use of their land for a better yield and income. The major goal of this IoT framework is to sense agriculture characteristics and advice farmers to properly grow and treat the crops. The system deploys a group of wireless sensor networks nodes deployed in the field for sensing agricultural parameters and the RF communication of WSN node is used to transmit the measured data to base station. Base station is connected to a decision support system. Based on the sensed parameters and the optimum values, the decision support system will generate an appropriate message for farmers. By using the collected data from the sensors, the proposed system will provide suggestions about the monitoring crop such as irrigation timings, directions for optimum usage of fertilizers etc. in accordance to the farmers' lands. An android application has been designed to deliver the messages to farmers in their regional language. The android app also gives information regarding the weather forecast and precaution to be taken based on the weather forecast. © 2017 IEEE.",Agriculture; Automation; IoT; Precision Farming; Smart Irrigation; Wireless Sensor Networks,Agriculture; Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Automation; Base stations; Crops; Decision support systems; Internet of things; Irrigation; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Android applications; Changing climate; Design and Development; Iot frameworks; Optimum value; Precision farming; RF communication; Water shortages; Weather forecasting,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"GHTC - IEEE Glob.

For these achievement of clustering techniques, optimization technique particle swarm optimization is used for data transmission through base station. If the base station is inaccessible region from the cluster-head, energy consumption will be augmented and it can shrink the lifetime of wireless sensor network. To conquer these, multi-hop gateway node is implemented with both protocol to achieve maximum lifetime and energy efficiency of wireless sensor network.

As, it can enhance lifetime of the sensor network by distributing load among the sensors. In some delay-critical applications, a mobile sink is allowed to move along a predefined path. However, due to the predefined path and relatively slower speed of mobile sink, data gathering from sensors may delayed. Thus, time-sensitive data collection in a constrained path environment using mobile sink has increased attention in the research community. Our proposed paper focuses on finding a sub-path on a given path in the network such that the mobile sink can collect maximum data from the network within given time.

The routing path to the sink is established using Grid Heads. Grid Heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternatively. So, not all Grid Heads take part in the routing process at a time.

In a given sensing field, sensor nodes can often be grouped into non overlapping subsets called clusters. Gaussian distribution is preferably used for realistic applications and can provide a reduction in energy hole problem and enhance intrusion detection capability. In this research paper, we proposed the cluster size optimization for the Gaussian distributed sensor nodes, while, Base Station (BS) follows a Tunable Multilevel Sensing Model (TMSM). Using this model, we obtained an expression to find optimal clusters. Herein, the communication between Cluster Heads (CH) and Base Station (BS) is considered to be of single-hop mode. Subsequently, it has illustrated the effectiveness of proposed model in comparison with two contemporary models (a) Gaussian distribution of sensor nodes, where a BS follows a simple (classical) sensing model (GSS) (b) Uniform distribution of sensor nodes, where a BS follows the simple (classical) sensing model (USS).

Secured and reliable routing in the WSN is the most arduous task which needs to be performed with more concern for the stable output. In the existing work clustering based symbiotic organism search method is used to share the data with assured reliability and packet delivery ratio. However, this approach lacks performance due to the intruder, and it is resolved in the proposed method by introducing the novel method namely hybridized pareto-glowworm swarm optimization and authenticated data communication. In this paper, cluster head selection is made by considering multiple quality of service parameters such mobility and energy whereas in the previous research only energy is considered. To select the optimal cluster head with multiple objectives, a pareto optimal method is hybridized with the GSO algorithm for the multi-objective fitness evaluation. Here formation of clusters is purely based on the selected cluster Head. After clustering, data is gathered from the multiple sensor nodes which are aggregated to reduce the bandwidth utilization and forwarded to the base station. To ensure the security level in this work authentication between the cluster head and the base station is done and then data is transmitted.

Due to this energy constraint, efficient routing protocol comes into picture. A sensor node senses the environment and generated the data. It sends the data to the sink with the help of nodes which are closer to the sink. Probability of depleting the energy of nodes near the sink increases and hence decreases the network lifetime. Mobile sink somehow solves this problem. In the proposed protocol, sensor nodes first get the updated position of the sink and then the data are directly sent to the sink. This protocol is rendezvous based routing protocol in which a rendezvous region is constructed in the middle of the network. This rendezvous region partitions the whole network area and distribute the network load among the sensor nodes which increases the network lifetime. Nodes inside this rendezvous region are divided into different clusters. Each cluster have one cluster head(CH) which is responsible for communication among different clusters. Sink sends its updated location information inside this rendezvous region, and when the sensor node wants to send the data it retrieves the sink's current location information from this rendezvous area and directly sends the data to the sink. © 2017 IEEE.",Area-Based Routing; Rendezvous area; Routing Protocol; Wireless sensor network,Internet protocols; Military applications; Network routing; Routing protocols; Temperature sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Area-based; Efficient routing; Energy constraint; Location information; Randomly distributed; Real-time application; Rendezvous area; Temperature sensing; Sensor nodes,,Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In multi-hop clustering, sensor nodes closer to the Base Station (BS) deplete their energy faster as compared to far away nodes. Transmission of own data as well as other nodes data by the nearer nodes is the prime cause for this uneven energy consumption. Hence, the nodes closer to the BS die quickly and network gets disconnected, though most of the nodes have adequate energy to communicate. This type of problem is known as hot spot problem in WSN. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop intra-cluster technique in uneven clustering, to minimizing the hot spot and intra-cluster communication problems. The BS divides the whole network into three types of unequal fixed square shaped Grids (clusters). In each cluster, the BS selects a Cluster Head (CH) based on number of hop or neighbour nodes and residual energy of the sensor nodes. Our proposed scheme uses both (centralized and distributed) methods for efficient routing in the network. Formation of all clusters and CH selection are performed centrally, whereas intra and inter-cluster communications are handled in a distributed manner. Here, uneven clusters help to minimize the hot spot problem in WSNs. In order to reduce the intra-cluster routing, we limit the forwarding packets maximum up to two hop in medium size and three hop in large size clusters. The BS checks residual energy of CH and its one hop child nodes after completion of every round. If either CH or one hop neighbours' residual energy is less than or equal to p fraction energy of the total energy, the BS station starts new CH selection process. By keeping intra-cluster communication distance minimum and avoiding rotation of CH in every round, this scheme saves significant amount of energy in WSN. The result obtained through simulation proves the superiority of our protocol in terms of residual energy, number of active nodes and network lifetime as compared to the existing protocols. Though, our protocol sustains upto more than 1000 rounds, proved that it has less hot spot as compared to other existing protocols. © 2017 IEEE.",Cluster head; hot spot; intra-cluster communication; Unequal cluster; Wireless sensor Network,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster head; Clustering techniques; Energy efficient routing; Hot spot; Intercluster communication; Intra-cluster communication; Unequal cluster; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044229391

Target coverage problem is nothing but each target should be in the coverage range of at least one sensor node. A sensor cover is a set of sensors that covers all the targets. Target coverage is achieved by proper deployment of sensor nodes and network lifetime is increases by scheduling activities of cover sets. So in this paper, performance of heuristic and artificial bee colony deployment algorithms are compared on the basis of upper bound of network lifetime. Then two scheduling techniques, heuristic and ant colony are analyzed for providing calculated upper bound for particular deployment technique.

These devices are generally called as 'nodes' of the network. In wireless ad-hoc networks, nodes do not depend on any pre-existing infrastructure. In these communications depends on the capability of the nodes to make a multi-hop radio network. Security is a major concern in every communication system. Every node in the network must be authenticated for reliable communication. There are many authentication mechanism like attribute based signature, identity based signature etc. Most of these mechanisms are either insecure or complex. We have proposed a distributed mechanism for authentication of nodes in wireless sensor networks. Tokens are used for authentication of nodes. The sensor nodes are logically arranged in the form of binary tree with base station forming the root node. A token is generated by the parent node for its child node. Then this token is used further by the child nodes for mutual authentication of the sensor nodes. The proposed protocol is simple and secure.

In many situations, each node of the WSN has to know its location in the real world. Several cost effective localization techniques can be used to locate each sensor. Among various techniques, the range based techniques are known for their accurate prediction of sensor location. The traditional gradient descent method like Gauss Newton updates the required parameters using derivative information. This kind of strategy works only if the derivative of the cost function exists. In addition to that, though the gradient techniques converge fast, they may be trapped by local minima. In such a case, Optimization Techniques (OTs) can be better alternatives. Among various OTs, the Differential Evolutionary Algorithm (DEA) is a popular one because it can find exact solution irrespective of initial parameters, fast convergence and consists of limited control parameters.

One of the main challenges for designing an object tracking technique is energy conservation. Prediction based strategies are used to save energy. We consider an application where a WSN is installed in a forest for tracking the movement of animals (objects). Since, animals move in certain paths rather moving entirely randomly, we attempt to use this property. The movement patterns of the objects are extracted using a data mining technique. This information is used to predict the object movement with the aim to reduce the energy consumption in tracking. In situations where the prediction is erroneous, we propose a systematic recovery mechanism. The recovery mechanism has three levels. The number of additional nodes woken up progressively increases with the increase in the recovery level. If an object has been detected at a lower level, normal operations are resumed. It is observed that there are significant energy savings due to this systematic recovery mechanism. The proposed technique, called DESPOT, is fully distributed and energy efficient. We have carried out extensive simulation of DESPOT and have compared its performance with an existing technique, called PTSP. Simulation results show that DESPOT conserves significant energy and it has a better tracking efficiency than PTSP. © 2017 IEEE.",data mining; distributed; prediciton; tracking; wireless sensor networks,Animals; Computer system recovery; Data mining; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Object detection; Recovery; Surface discharges; Tracking (position); distributed; Energy efficient; Extensive simulations; Normal operations; Prediciton; Prediction-based; Recovery mechanisms; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Thus energy must be used in optimized manner during the network operation. Most of routing algorithm use minimum hop distance and minimum transmission energy model. In such case same path is used many times which leads to drainage to energy of sensor nodes falling in routing path. Some time energy of nodes exhausted result in network partition. In this paper effort has made to develop energy optimized routing algorithm for WSN using genetic algorithm and further we tried to develop elitist genetic algorithm for routing.

They include many applications such as military and security applications, elementary monitoring, seismic monitoring, industrialized automation, wellness and robust monitoring etc. Due to its distributed nature and interconnected network approach, they are considered common target among attackers. WSNs are unprotected due to many attacks like illegal access, malicious node attack, wormhole attack, jamming attack, insider attack, cloning attack, routing attack and node capturing attack etc. Node capturing attack leads to node replication attack which is considered dangerous because after capturing node, attacker may extract all the encrypted information and further introduce many insider attacks. In node replication attack, attacker tries to capture the sensor node and if he becomes successful then he generates the replica which appears to be genuine.

Unlike common networks the WSNs have the capability of reconfiguration, whenever any defect occurs in the network. However, while routing in these network the loss of data is occurring due to its security lack. Hence many researchers have presented their research for providing secure routing in WSNs. The security is still an issue in routing of WSNs. In this paper, we have developed a novel protocol for the secure routing of WSNs, and named as Trust-Distrust Protocol (TDP). The proposed protocol has four stages, initial stage is topology management, where an improved k-means algorithm is applied. Then the second stage is Link Quality Appraisal, which means fitness evaluation of every nodes in the network. The third stage is Grading, in which based on the fitness value a grade point is allotted to every node. In the last stage the secure path for the routing is determined based on grade point. The proposed TDP is tested in NS2 and the performance is compared with the existing LEACH protocol. Ultimately the proposed protocol outperform the performance of the existing routing protocol. © 2017 IEEE.",Energy aware routing; Improved k-means algorithm; Routing protocol; Secure routing; Wireless Sensor Network,Grading; Internet protocols; Network routing; Network security; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Common networks; Energy-aware routing; Fitness evaluations; Improved K-Means algorithm; Leach protocols; Secure routing; Topology management; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Power management (telecommunication),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Owing to the cost constraints, only a limited amount of nodes in the network can know their locations by a variety of positioning mechanisms such as GPS or manual setup mechanism. These nodes are commonly called as anchor nodes, where as other nodes with unknown location information are called non-anchor nodes or static sensor nodes. Anchor nodes are positioned by employing RSS measurements in this proposed method. It plays a major role in the intermediate processing so as to get accurate position of the static sensor nodes. Hence the signals from anchors, used for computation should be accurate as well. Just because RSS is concerned, the deployment of the anchors is a vital issue.

Existing security protocols exploit various cryptographic tools to strengthen their security. Not many works focus on constraints faced by an adversary. One such constraint being practical difficulties to trace a particular frequency band from a large range of unknown frequencies, specially in unharmonious geographical locations. Our research capitalizes on this weakness encountered by an adversary and preassigns nodes with multiple frequency bands from a wide range of frequencies allocated to the network. Deployed nodes can discover these bands during set network setup phase by a simple trick. Nodes are to internally switch their frequency bands depending on parametric variation that are caused by an (external) impulse. Experiments conducted using magneto optic sensors confirm that any variation of their parameter affects frequencies of emergent waves. Similar behavior is expected from application specific sensors. Frequency regulation (FR) concept is applied to combinatorial key predistribution schemes (KPS) having (regular) degree r. Depending on r and each node's capability to switch internal frequencies, nodes are preallocated with n frequency bands. This naturally partitions the (distributed) network and results in improved resilience. Combining our FR concept to a KPS where the number of shared key between a pair of nodes is at most one (? ? 1) may yield best case scenario of an ideally resilient key predistribution. Our analysis of systems that combines FR idea with KPS where ? > 1 leads to an optimized key-band distribution argument and drastic resilience improvements. Results of simulations conducted assuming real-life scenario ascertain our analysis and establishes superior performance of our protocols as compared to prominent ones.

Both the nodes in the network and the jammer are capable of switching frequencies. Existing literature mostly thrive on mechanisms with a mutually pre-decided hopping-sequence or on random frequency-hopping techniques. However, these mechanisms often fall short in the context of energy-constrained WSNs. We propose a frequency-hopping strategy based on the optimal decision rule. The proposed solution takes into account the individual decision profiles of all the concerned nodes, and finally, makes the decision for the welfare of the overall network. The objective is to find an optimal frequency hopping rule to obtain the maximum throughput. We observe that the packet delivery ratio of the network improves by approximately 30% after the application of the optimal decision rule for frequency-hopping.

With increase in population and usage of RTS, safety measures are concerned to be most notable factor in the world. Moreover, during emergency cases internal wired safety setups of any RTS does not prevents drastic disaster and allows negative impact for on-demand reliable changes. As an alternative to other expensive technologies, wireless sensor network (WSN) system provides fast communicative and compact applications to RTS. Inorder to reduce causalities, designing such a network application to RTS always poses challenging problems in terms of fault tolerance and time bounded packet delivery. Integrated fuzzy-logic based synchronized data transmission (IFSDT) algorithm has been designed to optimize those challenges, especially in RTS. IFSDT is a synchronized energy aware algorithm that prevents the occurrence of potential faults during unexpected emergencies in the coaches of RTS and ensures the fast transmission of critical broadcast signal and response in a limited time span.

However, due to path restriction, a constant speed is assigned with mobile sink and this has limited the time for communication to collect the sensor data in randomly deployed sensor networks. Further, the collection of sensor data increases the consumption of power in such network. Hence to improve this cluster based block wise compressed path constrained sensing is introduced in clustered sensor networks. Here, two techniques are deployed to reduce the consumption of power in sensor network. To limit the communication time in collecting the sensor data, the shortest path tree computation is used. Also, to reduce the inherent data sparsity block wise compression over spatially correlated data is used. The collection of data is done by the cluster heads and forwarded to the base stations (BSs) using shortest path tree computation. This is formulated as a mixed linear integer programming problem, which is solved using adaptive amoeba algorithm. The block wise compression method uses compressed sensing (CS) in clustered WSN and the measurement is done through block diagonal matrix. The forwarding of CS measurements is done through shortest path algorithm and this relays the measurements to the BSs. The validation is carried out in terms of total consumed power due to the effect of sparsity and transferring the CS measurements to BS. The performance is evaluated based on optimal clustering for attaining reduced power consumption. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher throughput with increased energy efficiency than the other conventional methods. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Adaptive amoeba algorithm; Block diagonal matrix; Compressed sensing; Shortest path tree,Compressed sensing; Data acquisition; Data reduction; Energy efficiency; Graph theory; Integer programming; Matrix algebra; Protozoa; Trees (mathematics); Block diagonal matrices; Clustered sensor networks; Clustered wireless sensor networks; Conventional methods; Linear integer programming; Reduced power consumption; Shortest path algorithms; Shortest path tree; Wireless sensor networks,"Lakshminarayanan, R.; Anna University, S R S College of Engineering & TechnologyIndia; email: luckilux86@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037615351

In a network node, each sensor has several parts such as transceiver with an internal or connection to an external antenna, micro controller, electronic circuits for interfacing sensors and energy source. The scaling of single node cluster has a limitation of CPU computational powers, maximum memory and number of processes that can run on a single machine. In order to overcome these limitations multi node clusters are needed. To process huge amount of data at the same timeframe, multi node clusters are used. To monitor environment and physical conditions such as temperature, ambient light etc. and to cooperatively pass their data through network to a main location a distributed autonomous sensor called Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are used.

The wireless sensor communication network is one of the major components of the critical infrastructure in all networked systems including networked control systems and CPSs. As these systems support range of time and data sensitive applications, varying from health care to emergency services, to transport, and to environmental monitoring services, core sensor network component faces potential threats due to varying attacks, including wormhole attack that can cause damage to the control system in terms of data leakage, data dropping, and delayed delivery. It is also difficult to detect, as it requires neither nodes in the network to be compromised nor adversaries to acquire valid network identity to instigate such attacks. Many existing solutions in the literature to detect wormholes are based on node's static location information, synchronization of clocks, use of additional hardware, such as antennas and GPS, and neighborhood and traffic information, which may lead to large energy consumption. In this paper, a scalable and distributed scheme which uses sequential probability ratio test is proposed, to avoid single point failures and to handle high mobility, with no additional resource requirements. It is observed that wormholes are detected using few packets and detection is faster with increasing mobility. The system is highly customizable as system parameters can be chosen to balance the speed and accuracy of detection.

This results in high energy dissipation of the devices. Thus, balancing of energy consumption is a major concern in such kind of network. Appropriate cluster head (CH) selection may provide to be an efficient way to reduce the energy dissipation and prolonging the network lifetime in WSN. This paper has adopted the concept of fuzzy if-then rules to choose the cluster head based on certain fuzzy descriptors. To optimise the fuzzy membership functions, particle swarm optimisation has been used to improve their ranges. Moreover, recent study has confirmed that the introduction of a mobile collector in a network which collects data through short-range communications also aids in high energy conservation. In this work, the network is divided into clusters and a mobile collector starts from the static sink or base station and moves through each of these clusters and collect data from the chosen cluster heads in a single-hop fashion. Mobility based on ant-colony optimisation has already proven to be an efficient method which is utilised in this work. Additionally, instead of performing clustering in every round, CH is selected on demand. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with some existing clustering algorithms.

The constant monitoring of critical scenarios has make WSNs an attractive choice for researchers at a large scale. The main objective is to increase the network lifetime for optimal and efficient utilization of resources in WSNs. For optimum functionality, various approaches have been proposed based upon clustering. Network lifetime is related with energy level of sensor nodes deployed in region of interest. As sensor nodes have limited lifetime, so there is a need to develop an algorithm for aggregating the sensors data in WSNs. A novel Dynamic Adaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation (DAHDA) algorithm has been presented for evolving, uniform and non-uniform networks while maintaining the data accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to handle sudden bursts in the underlying data by recording the data in the area of interest for the whole event duration. The experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data shows that the algorithm performs well in terms of extending the lifetime of the network, maintaining the original distribution of the sensors as long as possible and maintaining the accuracy of the sensed data. DAHDA is an adaptive hierarchical aggregation algorithm for WSNs.

The data collected from the WSN is used for making decisions. The condition for making critical decision is to assure the trustworthiness of the data generated from sensor nodes. However, the approaches for scoring the sensed data alone is not enough in WSN since there is an interdependency between node and data item. If the overall trust score of the network is based on one trust component, then the network might be misguided. In this work, we propose the hybrid approach to address the issue by assigning the trust score to data items and sensor nodes based on data quality and communication trust respectively. The proposed hybrid trust management scheme (HTMS) detects the data fault with the help of temporal and spatial correlations. The correlation metric and provenance data are used to score the sensed data. The data trust score is utilized for making decision. The communication trust and provenance data are used to evaluate the trust score of intermediate nodes and source node. If the data item is reliable enough to make critical decisions, a reward is given by means of adding trust score to the intermediate nodes and source node. A punishment is given by reducing the trust score of the source and intermediate nodes, if the data item is not reliable enough to make critical decisions.

Clustering in WSNs significantly reduces the energy consumption in which the nodes are organized in clusters, each having a cluster head (CH). The CHs collect data from their cluster members and transmit it to the base station via a single or multihop communication. The main issue in such mechanism is how to associate the nodes to CHs and how to route the data of CHs so that the overall load on CHs are balanced. Since the sensor nodes operate autonomously, the methods designed for WSNs should be of distributed nature, i.e., each node should run it using its local information only. Considering these issues, we propose a distributed multiobjective-based clustering method to assign a sensor node to appropriate CH so that the load is balanced. We also propose an energy-efficient routing algorithm to balance the relay load among the CHs. In case any CH dies, we propose a recovery strategy for its cluster members. All our proposed methods are completely distributed in nature. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption and hence prolonging the network lifetime.

When a target enters in a monitoring region and moves around it, the deployed WSN is used to collect information about the target and send it to the nearby base station. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy based target tracking algorithm (CTFTT). The algorithm constructs a convoy tree around the target and dynamically moves the tree along with the target by adding new nodes into the tree and removing old nodes from the tree. The expansion, contraction and reconfiguration of the tree is done using a fuzzy based sensing model. Important advantages are (1) convoy tree provides 100% coverage, (2) fuzzy mechanism helps to localize the evevts such as tree expansion, contraction and reconfiguration. This in turn helps to reduce the energy consumption in the network. Localized events also reduce communication overhead. Thus CTFTT is able to support the tracking of even fast moving objects.

However, the significance of small world characteristics in wireless sensor network (WSN) applications has hitherto not been investigated. This work investigates the significance of introducing small world characteristics in a conventional WSN for improving the node localization accuracy. In this context, a novel constrained iterative average path length reduction algorithm is proposed to introduce small world characteristics into a conventional WSN. This method utilizes a novel frequency selective approach for the introduction of small world phenomena. The frequency selective approach utilizes two frequency bands for link addition and pruning to create an optimized small world WSN. Subsequently, a constrained least squares node localization method over the small world WSN is developed using both model-based and model-free signal propagation approaches. The proposed constrained iterative average path length reduction method provides reduced average path length and a high average clustering coefficient when compared to conventional WSN. Constrained least squares node localization over the small world WSN yields improved localization performance when compared to node localization over conventional WSN. Performance analysis in terms of localization error, power consumption, bandwidth and anchors required for node localization is also discussed. Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis for node location parameters is also used to provide insights into the error bounds obtained using the proposed method. The experimental results obtained are motivating enough for the introduction of small world phenomena in conventional WSN for applications like node localization and related applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Constrained iterative average path length reduction; Sensor node localization; Small world network; Wireless sensor network (WSN),Cramer-Rao bounds; Distributed computer systems; Error analysis; Frequency bands; Information dissemination; Iterative methods; Least squares approximations; Sensor nodes; Small-world networks; Average path length; Clustering coefficient; Constrained least squares; Cramer Rao lower bound; Localization errors; Localization performance; Node localization; Performance analysis; Wireless sensor networks,"Hegde, R.M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: rhegde@iitk.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,15708705,,,,English,Ad Hoc Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032475431

A number of range-based and range-free localization algorithms have been proposed in last two decades. Range-based schemes attain higher localization accuracy at the cost of extra ranging hardware whereas; range-free schemes are cost effective but show poor localization accuracy. In order to improve the localization accuracy, we have proposed dynamic range normal bisector (DRNB) algorithm which is a distributed range-free localization approach. In DRNB, connectivity between nodes, dynamic ranges of anchor nodes, and principle of normal bisector are used to determine the location of nodes. Each anchor node transmits beacon packets at two different range levels in the network. Each normal node estimates its location by calculating the centre point of the overlapping region of the communication ranges of neighbouring anchors where it lies. Normal bisector technique is used to find the centre point of this overlapping region. Sometimes estimated location of a node may fall out of this overlapping region. To overcome this problem, correction factor has also been proposed. DRNB is an energy efficient algorithm, as it doesnt require the exchange of information between neighbouring nodes. Analysis and simulation results show that DRNB performs better compared to other existing range-free schemes (e.g. centroid, restricted area based localization and mid-perpendicular algorithm). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Correction factor; Dynamic anchor range; Normal bisector technique; Range-free localization; WSN,Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Location; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Correction factors; Energy efficient algorithms; Exchange of information; Localization algorithm; Normal bisector technique; Range free localization; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,"Sharma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, CVR College of EngineeringIndia; email: ergaurav209@yahoo.co.in",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026800270

For example, WSN can be used to perform data collection in war field. However the qualities of service of WSN depending on various operations like routing and scheduling. Numerous routing protocols are being addressed to solve the scheduling problems in wireless sensor networks. But they suffer with poor QoS values. To address these issues, an energy efficient multi attribute time slot scheduling (MATSS) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is focused to extend the lifetime of sensor nodes with multi part dynamic routing (MPDR) neighbour conditions and previous time slot conditions. Based on both the values the node has been scheduled as sleep/wakeup mode and this will be performed for each time slot. The selection of node is performed according to the condition of neighbour nodes and energy parameter by sharing the information between them. The MPDR routing performs both shortest path routing and energy efficient longer route to maximize the network lifetime. Also it aims to maximize the throughput ratio. In the beginning the nodes are scheduled according to the protocol has been implemented in Network Simulator (NS-2) and It has been evaluated with different number of nodes. The MATSS algorithm schedules the node states based on previous state and neighbour conditions, this improves the throughput by 7.6% and reduces the latency up to 4 ms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Dynamic routing; Energy efficiency; QoS; Time slot scheduling; WSN,Dynamic routing algorithms; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Dynamic routing; Energy parameters; Network lifetime; Rapid deployments; Routing and scheduling; Scheduling problem; Shortest path routing; Time slot scheduling; Wireless sensor networks,"Periasamy, P.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, SNS College of EngineeringIndia; email: prakasamp@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027316227

The wireless sensor nodes in sensor network are powered using rechargeable batteries. However, providing energy to nodes in the remote environment is a major issue in WSN. Hence WSN needs a new energy efficient algorithm to enhance the network lifetime. In a sensor node, the transceiving module consumes more energy when compared to other modules. In this paper, a Battery Recovery based Lifetime Enhancement (BRLE) algorithm is discussed, which considers battery voltage curve for scheduling the transceiving module of the sensor nodes. The Markov model helps in determining the state of the sensor node as CH and CM based on battery recovery process. By scheduling the transceiving module based on the battery terminal voltage, recovery factor and distance between the nodes, the lifetime of the network is enhanced. Experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms the others by 1.38 times increased lifetime and 1.574 times increased throughput.

To make clustering more efficient, fuzzy clusters can be used to ensure faster cluster formation and reliable data delivery. A wireless sensor network such as MANETs can then have an extended lifetime with the workload being distributed evenly. This paper proposes a competent fuzzy approach in cluster formation. The proposed approach has two significant stages, one which helps in the formation of fuzzy clusters and the other introduces a 3-level filtering technique. The former makes MANETs efficient and manageable and the latter helps in identifying trusted nodes for communication. The modified Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is entrusted with the task of assigning membership to each and every data point linked to each singular cluster center used in the formation of clusters, while a special filter scheme is used to distinguish between the trusted nodes and the malicious nodes. This helps is determining the identity and authenticity of the cluster members. Eventually only the trusted nodes will be part of the communication range. The filter based fuzzy clustering approach can be used to determine the perfect nodes, which will reflect in the network performance.

The inherently non centralized nature of wireless sensor networks poses a problem as majority of the learning algorithms are centralized. It is also desirable that single routing algorithm be applicable regardless of whether the sensor network is a dense single-hop network or a sparse multi-hop network. In this paper we present the two phased routing incorporating distributed genetic algorithm and gradient based heuristic (TRIGGER) as an attempt to solve these problems. In the first phase of TRIGGER a distributed (island model) genetic algorithm based clustering is employed to find a spatially optimal cluster assignment.

Security thus becomes a critical requirement for code dissemination protocols in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper proposes a loss and denial of service (DoS) resistant secure code dissemination algorithm that supports multiple authorized tenants, referred in this work as a loss and DoS resistant secure code dissemination (LDSCD) for WSNs. In LDSCD, a social role-based distributed online code dissemination framework is proposed. In the proposed framework, the owner of WSNs is not directly involved in the code dissemination and a conditional proxy re-signature technique is utilized to authorize different tenants. The algorithm also proposes a detailed conditional proxy re-signature scheme for the online code dissemination with a security proof.

The algorithm employed there, modeled the intrusion signal as a linear combination of chirplets. The extracted chirplet-based features were fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification. This resulted in a platform that, under the tested conditions, resulted in high classification accuracy, in excess of 95%. The current paper is aimed at determining the extent to which the classification accuracy could be attributed to the use of the algorithm employed. Fifteen different algorithms for intrusion detection and classification are examined in the current paper, these operate on a database that builds on top of the earlier database. These fifteen algorithms correspond to the different possible pairings obtained by selecting from among 5 feature-vectors and 3 classifiers. The results show that the chirplet-based feature extractor to play a major role in achieving high-accuracy classification, easily beating the performance of the other feature extractors, particularly in terms of the more challenging task of separating intrusion from vegetative clutter. The two principal conclusions that can perhaps be drawn here are that (a) chirplet-decomposition can be a very effective feature-extractor in the case of a PIR signal and (b) it is important to incorporate domain knowledge where possible in designing the most effective classification algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Passive infrared sensor; Pattern classification; Pyroelectric infrared sensor; Wildlife protection; Wireless sensor network,Animals; Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Feature extractor; Linear combinations; Outdoor environment; Passive infrared sensors; Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensor; Wildlife protection; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Energy sustainability can be achieved by developing an energy friendly, context aware wireless sensor network which is overlaid on the existing electrical network. This smart environment is supported by efficient algorithms for dynamic energy management in smart buildings. Generally, the home energy management system has different functions. These include a) controlling the energy consumption at peak times, b) updating consumers about the real time power consumption inside the home area network, and c) helping the consumer to schedule the operation of appliances based on the real time pricing from the utility company. Also it is very important to analyze how the users can minimize electricity bills while achieving electrical energy conservation with a reasonable level of consumer comfort. The proposed availability based management algorithm (AMA) enhances the existing home energy management system by helping the consumers to supervise and control their monthly electricity tariff payment. The AMA performs an advance initial distribution of energy for upcoming days which helps to keep the power consumption of the residence within a stipulated limit. This research explains and demonstrates, using real data collected from an office building case example, how the AMA works in different scenarios. The results show that the AMA offers effective management of monthly tariff and energy consumption in variable use cases. From the experimentation result, the proposed system achieves 65.08% deduction in energy consumption with the energy unaware system and 30.16% deduction in energy consumption with pattern based energy management system. © 2017 IEEE.",Availability based management algorithm; Energy management; Smart building; User behavior,Behavioral research; Buildings; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Energy utilization; Home networks; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Sustainable development; Wireless sensor networks; Dynamic energy managements; Effective management; Electrical networks; Energy management schemes; Energy sustainability; Home energy management systems; Renewable energies; User behaviors; Energy management systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In many scenarios, the coverage area of the WSN will be very large and a multi-hop adhoc network needs to be maintained for the connectivity and data transfer among the nodes. The major part of the energy consumption of each node is used for data transfer among nodes. This paper proposes a energy efficient routing scheme. The scenario which is considered is a wireless sensor network which is a collection of clusters and data transfer happens with the help of cluster head (CH) rather than the collective effort of every node in the network. In such a cluster based WSN, it is advantageous to have a routing protocol which uses the information about clusters to decide upon route formation. This paper proposes a novel Cluster Based Routing Protocol for a WSN which optimizes the energy consumption on data transfer and thus increasing the lifetime of the WSN network. To conclude the advantages of the proposed scheme, comparison is carried out between the performance of AODV and CBRP protocols. © 2017 IEEE.",Cluster Based WSN; Data Aggregation; Data Transmission; Energy Efficiency; On Demand Routing; Routing Protocols; Wireless Sensor Networks,Data communication systems; Data transfer; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Patient monitoring; Power management (telecommunication); Remote patient monitoring; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Structural health monitoring; Virtual reality; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster-based; Data aggregation; Disaster management; Energy efficient routing; On demand routing protocols; On-demand routing; Search and rescue operations; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Every node is able to observe the substantial surroundings and send it to the sink either in single hop or multihop fashion. In the network, the nodes which is nearer to the sink will lose their liveliness soon. Clustering is a key method for reducing the power utilization and also the life time of the network is increased at the same time. In this method, entire network is separated as a set of clusters. Each cluster consists of one cluster head (CH) and non cluster member nodes from each cluster will transfer the sensed data to the CH. This will take care of forwarding the information to the end user.

These low power sensor nodes consume energy for data routing to destination i.e., sink. Sensor node dies once it all energy is exhausted. This creates an unstable network. Hence, it is a key challenging task to increase the stability period of the network i.e., the time interval before the first node is dead. To address this key problem, in this paper a novel evolutionary based routing algorithm named Green Stable Evolutionary Routing Algorithm (GSERA) is proposed. This algorithm aims at prolonging the stability period. This in response improves the energy efficiency and reliability of the WSNs. The simulations of GSERA over 45 WSNs is found and compared with the state-of-the-art evolutionary based Evolutionary Routing Protocol (ERP).

As the sensors are deployed randomly, initial placements of sensors may not guarantee coverage of all targets. In this paper, we consider the problem of covering all the targets in the surveillance region by relocating a subset of the sensors with the objective of minimizing the sum of the distance moved by the sensors. We have proposed an algorithm for the problem which runs in two phases. In the first phase a subset of sensors are relocated to new positions to ensure coverage of all the targets. The sensors which cover one or more targets after the first phase are called assigned sensors. In the second phase some of the unassigned sensors are relocated to ensure connectivity i.e. a path should exist from each assigned sensor to the base station (BS). The general case of the problem, where it is possible to cover multiple targets by a single sensor, finding the optimal placement of sensors is NP complete. We have designed a heuristic for relocating the sensors which runs in polynomial time and ensures coverage and connectivity. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. The cost of our solution is very close to the optimal for the first phase of the algorithm.

However, active outsider adversary model in which as adversary is allowed to compromise the legitimate sensor of the group is a strong model. In this work, we show that the key management schemes for wireless sensor networks based on bivariate polynomials, exclusive basis systems, key tree etc are not secure against active outsider model. In particular, we show that an outside adversary by compromising the legitimate sensor could obtain access not only to the current session group key but also the past group keys. Adversary can get the past keys despite the fact that the sensor nodes have erased the past group keys. To secure them against active adversary all the keys should be updated for every rekeying event which incurs additional cost of computation and communication for managing keys.

Sensor networks are battery powered, therefore become dead after a certain period of time. Thus, improving the data dissipation in energy efficient way becomes more challenging problem, in order to improve the lifetime for sensor devices. The clustering and tree based data aggregation for sensor networks, can enhance the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Hybrid Ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based energy,, efficient clustering and tree based routing protocol is proposed. Initially, clusters are formed on the basis of remaining energy, then, hybrid ACOPSO based data aggregation will come in action to improve the inter-cluster data aggregation further.

However, there is an impact of the path selection for the mobile sink on the data delivery delay. Hence selection of optimal number of halting positions called rendezvous points (RPs) and their locations are challenging in WSNs. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to select RPs for construction of path for the mobile sink in WSNs. We first propose a technique for generating a set of potential positions which act as the possible positions for the RPs. Next, we propose a greedy algorithm for selecting the minimum number of potential positions as RPs. These RPs used to construct the path for the mobile sink. We simulate the proposed algorithm with some existing algorithms and compare the results using various performance metrics such as number of RPs, average waiting time and path length etc. to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",Data delivery latency; Mobile sink; Path selection; Rendezvous points; Wireless sensor networks,Computer programming; Computer science; Average waiting-time; Data delivery; Data delivery delays; Mobile sinks; Path selection; Performance metrics; Rendezvous point; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Performing outlier detection to detect faulty sensors from such a large amount of data becomes a challenging task. Most of the existing techniques for outlier detection in wireless sensor networks concentrate only on contents of the data source without considering correlation among different data attributes. Moreover, these methods are not scalable to big data. To address these 2 limitations, this paper proposes an outlier detection approach based on correlation and dynamic SMO (sequential minimal optimization) regression that is scalable to big data. Initially, correlation is used to find out strongly correlated attributes and then the point anomalous nodes are detected using dynamic SMO regression. For fast processing of big data, Hadoop MapReduce framework is used. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach efficiently detects the point and contextual anomalies and reduces the number of false alarms. For experiments, real data of sensors used in body sensor networks are taken from Physionet database.

Sink mobility enhances the lifetime of the sensor network by distributing data traffic load among the sensors. In certain applications, a mobile sink is passed on a fixed path. However, due to the constrained path (fixed path) and relatively slower speed of mobile sink, data delivery is delayed. In practice, some data-intensive applications have strict delay requirements to collect sensors data. Thus, data collection with a strict time deadline in a constrained path environment using mobile sink has increased attention among the researchers. In this article, our focus is to find a sub-path on a given path for the mobile sink to collect the maximum amount of data from the sensors in the network within a given time deadline, referred as maximum data gathering sub-path finding problem (MDSP).

It reduces the data gathering tour length. Mobile sinks collect data from the sensors directly in single hop to prolong sensors lifetime. Our proposed algorithm is more suitable for the network which is clustered into multiple connected components. A mobile sink is a vehicle equipped with a transceiver to collect data from sensors. It collects data from sensors while moving in the sensory field. A novel component based single hop data gathering algorithm (CBSHDG) is proposed to minimize the tour length of the network. It ensures that all sensors are reachable to the mobile sink within single hop. A single hop data gathering collects data directly from the sensors without using relay node and prolonged the network lifetime. Our proposed algorithm first finds an ordering among the components so that total tour length is less. Thereafter, a component based polling point selection algorithm (CBPPSA) is introduced to find a set of polling points within each component. It ensures that every sensor is reachable from one of the polling points. Our proposed algorithm is simulated in MATLAB to demonstrate its performance. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Component based data gathering; Mobile sink; Network coverage; Sensor networks,Radio transceivers; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Component based; Connected component; Data gathering; Mobile sinks; Network coverage; Network lifetime; Novel component; Point selection; Data acquisition,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Due to the use of random deployment strategy in such areas, the load must be balanced equally among the sensor nodes for efficient utilization of energy and extending the network life time. Hence, an efficient load balancing algorithm is proposed for grid-based clustering where merging and splitting of clusters is devised for sparse and dense clusters respectively and cross clustering is applied for averagely dense clusters. We have used multi-hop communication among the Cluster Heads (CHs) which reduces the energy consumption as well. The decision of cluster members to join adjoining cluster depends on its distance from both its current CH and adjoining CH. Thus communication of data, that requires the highest amount of energy, will be done for a short distance. Hence, the amount of energy spent by cluster members in communicating is also reduced. The overhead comparison with an existing algorithm depicts that the proposed algorithm being centralized in nature generates asymptotically the same amount of control packets as a distributed approach does. Our algorithm can perform better in terms of energy consumption and load balancing which eventually increases the network lifetime and minimizes creation of energy holes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cluster; Cluster Head; Energy Efficient; Grid; Load Balance; Wireless Sensor Network,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Cluster head; Energy efficient; Grid; Load balance; Clustering algorithms,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Applicability of the field in almost all domains support the claim, reasons being the ability of these networks to work efficiently even in harsh environments. Instead of all nodes participating in the sensing process, a better approach is data aggregation with clustering as its direct application. Selection of cluster representatives/heads is a crucial task mainly because the performance of any clustering protocol mainly depends on this criterion. Recently, a fuzzy logic based selection criterion was proposed. However, the round-by-round approach of the authors added to the complexity in the network in terms of the number of messages exchanged between the nodes per round.

As the application areas of the WSN are increasing at the same rate the security threats are also increasing. Intruders are applying various mechanisms to access the sensible and confidential data from sensors. Hence, strong security measures are much needed to immune WSNs from various attacks. Authentication is a security mechanism that protects WSNs from wide range of security attacks. In this paper, an authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is based on tokens. Any node when deployed in WSN is embedded with base station's public key and through the corresponding cluster head; it requests and acquires its token for authentication from the base station. The generated token is light in weight and reduces much of computational, communicational and storage overheads. The proposed protocol is verified for its security both formally and automatically.

This paper is mainly focused on TESDA protocol against the compromised nodes that attempt to inject fake data into the data aggregation process. To optimize the data aggregation process in the existence of compromised nodes, the TESDA integrates an energy efficient clustering approach and a trust-based security mechanism. The trust-based security mechanism of TESDA allows the sink and cluster head to estimate a deviation based trust and it diminishes the impact of the compromised sensor node contribution in aggregation performance. By considering the current trust values of sensor nodes in the cluster head election process, the TESDA optimizes the cluster head election performance and also enhances the routing performance By electing a CH based on residual energy, the clustering mechanism of TESDA attains fair energy consumption among nodes within the cluster. Thus, it prolongs the overall network. © 2017 IEEE.",BS; CH; LEACH; SDAF; TESDA; WSN,Blind source separation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Leaching; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-head elections; Clustering mechanism; Compromised nodes; Energy Efficient clustering; Routing performance; SDAF; TESDA; Trust-based security; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

The recorded data will be passed through the network from a sensor to a main location. Sensors life time is based on the battery power. Lower the battery power leads to decrease in lifetime for a sensor. It is important to increase the lifespan of sensors and also to distribute the power over WSN. Energy can be efficiently used up to some level in one of the hierarchy routing protocol that is Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). This paper compares the performance of LEACH, Genetic-LEACH and Inter cluster Communication in LEACH. Here, first analyzed the basic operations involved in LEACH and then it is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to extend the life time of WSN. Finally these results are compared with LEACH which uses inter cluster communication to reach sink instead of direct communication.

The distributed nature of this network has several QoS issues and these are addressed by the clustered QoS routing protocol. Due to the dynamic nature of the wireless sensor network the nodes may move from one position to another position. If the moved node is a header node and it is not in the communication range of its neighbor header, then there will be link breakage between two header nodes. Once such link failure occurs, then single network will be partitioned into two different networks. They cannot communicate each other and it leads to packet dropping. Existing methods addresses link failure by rerouting protocols. But it will take time to construct rerouting. To address this issue, a Header to base station and base station to header (H2B2H) protocol is proposed. When there is a link failure between two header nodes, that is, between predecessor CH and successor CH, the proposed protocol will be automatically invoked. According to the proposed H2B2H protocol, the predecessor will send the data to the base station. The base station has information about all the nodes. So the base station will take the responsibility to forward the data to the destination group cluster head. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm increases throughput, packet delivery rate, network life time and decreases the packet dropping rate, end to end delay, energy consumption of header nodes and routing overheads. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",H2B2H protocol; Link breakage; Network partition; Packet dropping; Predecessor CH; QoS; Successor CH,Base stations; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Packet loss; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Telecommunication links; Wireless sensor networks; Link breakages; Network partitions; Packet dropping; Predecessor CH; Successor CH; Sensor nodes,"Krishnan, R.; Deprtment of Infornation Technology, PSNA College of Engineering&TechnologyIndia; email: rajkumardgl@psnacet.edu.in",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034116004

The current paper explores the use of an optical camera as a complementary sensing modality in an outdoor WSN deployment to reliably handle such situations. A combination of backgroundsubtraction and the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow algorithms is used to classify between human and animal in an outdoor environment based on video data.,The algorithms were developed keeping in mind the need for the camera to act when called upon, as a substitute for the PIR sensor by turning in comparable classification accuracies. All algorithms are implemented on a mote in the case of the PIR sensor array and on an Odroid single-board computer in the case of the optical camera. Three sets of experimental results are presented. The first set shows the optical-camera platform to turn in under supervised learning, high accuracy classification (in excess of 95%) comparable to that of the PIR sensor array. The second set of results correspond to an outdoor WSN deployment over a period of 7 days where similar accuracies are achieved. The final set also corresponds to a single-day outdoor WSN deployment and shows that the optical camera can act as a stand-in for the PIR sensor array when the ambient temperature conditions cause the PIR sensor to perform poorly. © 2017 IEEE.",background-subtraction; intrusion detection; Lucas-Kanade; optical camera; passive infrared sensor; pyroelectric infrared sensor; wildlife protection; Wireless sensor network,Animals; Cameras; Computer networks; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Background subtraction; Lucas-kanade; Optical camera; Passive infrared sensors; Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensor; Wildlife protection; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Conf.

The proposed receiver divides each data symbol frame duration into smaller multiple time windows. In each time window, peak of received signal is detected independently using threshold comparison. The transmitted signal is detected in a frame by employing decisions on all multiple time windows. From simulation, it is observed that the proposed receiver outperforms existing non-coherent receivers.

In our proposed work, energy efficient concentric circular clustering protocol(EECCCP), the energy heterogeneity normal and the super nodes having flat topology while the advance nodes having clustering topology, are deployed in different zones of concentric circular network field. A hybrid communication with energy heterogeneity increases the network lifetime. The protocol considers the average energy of the network and residual energy of the nodes to select the cluster-heads. Since the network field is circular with the base station at the center and the nodes with same energy are deployed at equal distance from the base station, this topology increases the network life time and stability of the network.

With the evolvement of latest global web technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), Device-to-Device and Machine-to-Machine communication has opened new doors for Wireless Sensor Network applications. Heterogeneity in terms of energy in the devices independent or embedded is an inherent property of WSNs for internet-of-things. Dissimilar energy consumption of sensor nodes has become a crucial factor for the designing and development of clustering protocols. Stability period and network lifetime are the basic parameters for the realization of network from energy balancing point of view. Scalability in the network with variant number of nodes as well as different values of energies has allowed analysis of stability period, network lifetime and also sub-periods of lifetime for better connectivity, coverage and efficient communication in the above mentioned web applications. Periodic assessment of sub periods of lifetime for event based dynamic monitoring of the objects in internet-of-things will prove advantageous in the coming decades. A protocol based on broad and crossover transmission distance for heterogeneous wireless sensor network system is proposed here. This approach of Heterogeneous Broad Transmission Distance Protocol (HT-BTDP) with scalability is put forward for field-specific as well as event based applications of WSNs in IoT.

We allow for imperfect communication links, where information packets may be lost due to noise and collisions. The packets that are received correctly are used to estimate the objects' trajectories by employing an extended Kalman Filter, where provisions are made to accommodate a randomly changing number of obseravtions in each iteration. An adaptive rate control scheme is additionally applied to instruct the sensor nodes on how to adjust their transmission rate so as to improve the location estimation accuracy and the energy efficiency of the system. By focusing explicitly on the objects' locations, rather than working with a pre-specified grid of potential locations, we resolve the spatial quantization issues associated with sparse identification methods. Finally, we extend the method to address the possibility of objects entering and departing the observation area, thus improving the scalability of the system and relaxing the requirement for accurate knowledge of the objects' initial locations. Performance is analyzed in terms of the mean-squared localization error and the trade-offs imposed by the limited communication bandwidth. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Adaptive rate control; Kalman Filter; Object tracking; Wireless sensor network,Adaptive control systems; Bandpass filters; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Extended Kalman filters; Iterative methods; Location; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Underwater acoustics; Wireless sensor networks; Adaptive rate control; Identification method; Limited communication; Localization errors; Location estimation; Object Tracking; Spatial quantization; Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Kalman filters,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,"Proc.

For saving resources as well as energy, data should be collated for reducing quantity of traffic in the network. Data aggregation is to be carried out with the assistance of a clustering strategy. Cluster-based routing in WSNs is an effective solution for enhancing energy efficacy of nodes as well as resourceful data aggregation. Several studies on network life time as well as data aggregation are suggested with low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) scheme which permits the part of the cluster head (CH) to be rotated amongst the sensor nodes and focuses on the distribution of energy use throughout all nodes. Life time of WSNs are impacted by the choosing of CHs; this is due to the fact that CH consumed more energy than other member nodes. In the current work, an energy effective CH election in mobile WSNs is suggested, analysed as well as evaluated based on residual energy as well as randomized election of nodes that were not designated as CHs in earlier rounds. The study proposes random competition based clustering (RCC) strategy which is more stable than the traditional clustering strategies like Lower ID (LID). IWO or Invasive Weed Optimization is a metaheuristic that has been developed recently to mimic the behaviour of the weeds. But the spatial dispersal operators and reproduction in the IWO that was originally used can make the seeds stay around the weed that is considered best that can result in convergence prematurely. In order to overcome this, EIWO or Enhanced IWO algorithm has been developed using TS or Tabu Search. Furthermore, the suggested method reveals considerable improvement in contrast to IWO LID as well as IWO-TS LID with regard to average end to end delays of sensor nodes, average packet delivery ratio of sensor nodes as well as improved network life time at the time of transmitting information. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Cluster heads (CH) election; Lower ID (LID); Mobility; Random competition based clustering (RCC); Wireless sensor network (WSN),Carrier mobility; Cluster analysis; Low power electronics; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Tabu search; Average end-to-end delays; Based clustering; Cluster head; Invasive weed optimization; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Lower ID (LID); Resource-constrained network; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Narendran, M.; Anna UniversityIndia; email: narendran.m.2016@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033451950

Due to multiple node failures, network topology may change or partition into many disconnected segments causing data/query path breakage. Early detection and recovery of faults is desirable in most scenarios. Also, due to limited battery life of a node, the solution must consume minimum possible energy for prolonged network operation. Hence in this paper, we propose a Fault Detection and Recovery scheme which is an energy efficient fault detection and recovery strategy that achieves minimum data loss by efficiently replacing faulty node on the present route or by finding full or partial alternate paths. Topology is managed by constructing a virtual grid over the entire network which helps in managing dynamically changing network topology easily and makes failure detection and recovery effective. It also helps to create energy efficient path between a source and a sink by finding shortest possible path. Further, nodes cooperation is exploited to create certain zones on the data/query path which provides alternate nodes or possible alternate paths if required on some node failures. Thus, scheme achieves fault tolerance and at the same time achieves energy efficiency by always selecting shortest path for data delivery between source and sink.

The most widely accepted method to preserve energy of sensor nodes is clustering. In cluster based networks, energy consumption is higher in the nodes which are closer to the sink as compared to the nodes which are located farther away from base station (BS). Various unequal clustering algorithms were proposed in the past to correct this issue. The major drawbacks in the findings are that the nodes, which join a specific cluster head, cause overburdening of the cluster head. In this paper, we present an algorithm namely energy efficient unequal sector clustering (EUSC) using multi-sector and unequal clustering approaches which improve the networks energy efficiency. EUSC divides the network into multiple sectors based on nodes distances from BS. Selection of cluster heads in each sector is based on nodes distances to BS, residual energy and neighbor nodes proximities in that sector. Selection of a relay cluster head for data transmission is also based on residual energy, nodes distances to BS and queue length of nodes. In this paper, we have carried out some theoretical analysis of the nodes energy consumption in each sector and derived an expression for optimal number of clusters in each sector to minimize nodes energy consumption. Various simulations were carried out with MATLAB package to differentiate the competency of the proposed EUSC algorithm with that of the existing protocols ECHA and PSO based protocol. Simulation results in different network scenarios indicate that EUSC has given much improved performance than ECHA and PSO based protocol in terms of number of clusters formed during each round, network lifetime and energy efficiency. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Energy consumption; Sector; Unequal clusters; Wireless sensor networks,Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based networks; Energy efficient; Energy minimization; Number of clusters; Sector; Unequal clustering; Unequal clusters; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,"Sundaran, K.; School of Computing, SRM UniversityIndia; email: karthika.su@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032939072

Recent technological advances in wireless networking, IC fabrication and sensor technology have lead to the emergence of millimetre scale devices that collectively form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and are radically changing the way in which we sense, process and transport signals of interest. They are increasingly become viable solutions to many challenging problems and will successively be deployed in many areas in the future such as in environmental monitoring, business, and military applications. However, deploying new technology, without security in mind has often proved to be unreasonably dangerous. This also applies to WSNs, especially those used in applications that monitor sensitive information (e.g., health care applications). There have been significant contributions to overcome many weaknesses in sensor networks like coverage problems, lack in power and making best use of limited network bandwidth, however; work in sensor network security is still in its infancy stage. Security in WSNs presents several well-known challenges stemming from all kinds of resource constraints of individual sensors. The problem of securing these networks emerges more and more as a hot topic. Symmetric key cryptography is commonly seen as infeasible and public key cryptography has its own key distribution problem. In contrast to this prejudice, this paper presents a new symmetric encryption standard algorithm which is an extension of the previous work of the authors i.e. UES version-II and III. Roy et al recently developed few efficient encryption methods such as UES version-I, Modified UES-I, UES version-II, UES version-III. The algorithm is named as Ultra Encryption Standard version - IV algorithm. It is a Symmetric key Cryptosystem which includes multiple encryption, bit-wise reshuffling method and bit-wise columnar transposition method. In the present work the authors have performed the encryption process at the bit-level to achieve greater strength of encryption. The proposed method i.e. UES-IV can be used to encrypt short message, password or any confidential key. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptography; Energy Efficient; Sensor networks,Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Health care; Military applications; Public key cryptography; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Environmental Monitoring; Health care application; Security in wireless sensor networks; Sensitive informations; Symmetric key cryptography; Symmetric-key cryptosystem; Technological advances; Network security,"Praveena, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jansons Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: praveenasngp@gmail.com",Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,IEEE Int.

The factors like multipath fading, path loss, Doppler spread, limited battery power, and high mobility void region cause UWSNs to become spatially variable. In this paper, the idea of Geography-based Opportunistic Routing (GOR) is applied to advance the packet towards the destination and to handle the void problem. The proposed design is termed as Void Handling using Geo-Opportunistic Routing (VHGOR). In executing so, a heuristic algorithm comprising two metrics, namely OREPP and NCD for optimal forwarder selection is proposed. Additionally, a void handling mechanism is also proposed that handles void in two ways. Quick hull algorithm that makes a convex hull assists to identify whether the void is convex or concave. When the node approaches a convex void, reconstruction of convex hull helps to determine an alternative way to resume the greedy forwarding if the node has neighbors within its proximity. Failure of convex void handling during communication void makes VHGOR switch to concave void handling (or) recovery mode to recover the packet from local maximum node and to route the packet to the destination. At the end of simulation, the proposed VHGOR results considerably improve the network performance when compared with the existing solutions, both in sparse and very dense networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Convex hull; Geography Opportunistic Routing; Local maximum; Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks; Void handling,Computational geometry; Heuristic algorithms; Network routing; Underwater acoustics; Wireless sensor networks; Convex hull; Local maximum; Opportunistic routing; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Void handling; Sensor nodes,"Kanthimathi, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: kanthimathi.phd@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,457906,,CPEEB,,English,Comput Electr Eng,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027506588

In order to establish a dynamic session secret amongst a group of sensor nodes in a WSN, group-key broadcast is found to be a workable solution. However, when a node misses one or more group-key broadcast messages, rebroadcasting results in additional energy consumption at node end and increased network traffic as well. Self-healing mechanism is, therefore, used to recover the lost broadcasts using a future session broadcast. A node, that has missed multiple consecutive broadcasts and does not want to wait for a future broadcast, can obtain the session key through mutual-healing with the help of a neighbor node. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient mutual-healing protocol that uses Chinese remainder theorem(CRT) based secret sharing for group key broadcast. During mutual-healing, mutual authentication and key confirmation are provided. The probability of an unauthorized member retrieving a past session key through self-healing or responding to a mutual-healing request as a neighbor node is shown negligible.

The mobile sink moves throughout the network and collects data in a single-hop fashion resulting in less energy consumption of the sensor nodes. Despite the advantage of this scheme, data forwarding to the mobile sink during an emergency situation is a major issue that should be dealt with. For efficient data delivery within the stipulated deadline, the sensor node which has sensed a delay-intolerant data needs to forward the data towards the mobile sink. In this paper, a Moore curve based trajectory of the mobile sink has been considered for efficient sink based data collection. This work is also motivated by anycast forwarding of delay sensitive data to the mobile sink before the sensed data lose its relevance, where the node follows a strict sleep-wake pattern. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory based data collection scheme by simulation using MATLAB. The delay-intolerant data routing scheme (DRS) shows that the data reaches the mobile sink within the given deadline while restricting the energy dissipation of the sensor nodes to a minimum.

Enumeration search method cannot find optimal clusters within polynomial bounded time for large scale networks since the computational complexity of problem grows exponentially with the dimension of networks. Optimal cluster configuration in sensor networks is known to be Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP)-hard optimization problem and for that reason we have applied polynomial time metaheuristic algorithms to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. In this paper, we present clustering algorithms based on Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find optimal set of cluster heads in the network. The optimization problem consists of finding optimal configuration of clusters such that the communication distance per cluster is not only minimized but the cluster balance and energy efficiency is also maintained in the network. The SA and PSO toolboxes are developed in C++ and integrated with OMNeT++ simulation environment to implement the proposed clustering algorithms.

Using sets of virtual points together with actual locations of the moving anchor, it computes a convex hull. The points lying on the convex hull are used to construct an optimized circle whose center and radius is used to compute the location of the sensor iteratively. We have shown that the proposed scheme converges to the actual location of an unlocalized sensor. We observe that the localization error for the proposed scheme decreases with an increase in the number of iterations.

One of the core challenges of WSN is to increase the network life time, meaning that the efficiency of power utilisation should be the maximum. The major reasons for high power consumption are drawn out transmission path to reach sink, work load add-ons on nodes closer to storage medium, and the energy necessary for storage. This study proposes a novel method of data storage and retrieval for WSN environment to improve the network lifetime by minimising the energy consumption. The proposed method accomplishes this milestone using four novel algorithms, namely weighted optimum storage-node placement(SNP), efficient and energetic wireless recharging, efficient rule-based node rotation and critical-state-data passing. The areas of influence of this proposed method are SNP, wireless recharging, node rotation and cooperative multi-input-multi-output clustering/routing.

In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a sensor node collects all the data and forwarded to a sink node. The position of the sink node has a huge impact on the energy consumption and lifetime of WSNs. The collected data is transmitted through multihop communication to the sink. Data aggregation is a well-known approach in WSN and it is a process of collecting and aggregating the data from multiple sensors to provide combined information to the base station. This process repeats for many rounds in collecting these data efficiently that is to reduce the energy cost of data transmission. Traditionally tree-based structured approach is a basic operation for periodically sensing and collecting reports from all sensors nodes and sends it to the sink. It can find the shortest path between the leaf nodes and sink for transmitting the data in more efficient way in order to reduce the energy utilization. It is been known that this paper proposes algorithms such as Angular Query Region Division Routing Algorithm In Angular algorithm data aggregation protocol are used for sensing and collecting the data.

On the other hand multi-hop communication significantly reduces the energy required for communication and multi-path communication helps in distributing the relay load and it also increases reliability of the network. The proposed methodology in this paper is a combination of these three features. In addition to that, we have used fuzzy logic in cluster head (CH) selection to blend different parameters to select the set of best possible CHs and to handle the uncertainties in parametric quantities. There are five main aspects of the proposed algorithm (a) on demand based clustering (b) fuzzy logic based CH selection (c) dynamic unequal cluster range for CHs (d) a cost function based multi-hop relay selections (e) Fibonacci sequence based relay load distribution. The proposed approach creates more balanced cluster by means of fuzzy logic and inequality in cluster range. It saves energy by conducting CH selection on demand basis. Finally, the cost function based multi-hop relay selections along with Fibonacci sequence based relay load distribution create an optimal structure for relaying data.The proposed approach is implemented and compared with the well known approaches like LEACH, ECPF, CHEF and UCR.

DFS is used to provide robustness to the network and also reduces the power utilization. This TTH scheduler is more advantageous than TTC scheduler in distributed system, since long task problem can be overcome by means of this algorithm. The model is simulated using the TORSCHE toolbox of the MATLAB. Some of the applications of this scheduling are data acquisition and sampling in wireless sensor networks, control system engineering, patient monitoring using wireless sensor networking and so on. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Co-operative; Deadline; Efficiency; Fault tolerance; Frequency scaling; Hybrid; Pre-emption; Reliable; Scheduler; Time triggered; Token,Dynamic frequency scaling; Efficiency; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Interactive computer systems; Network protocols; Patient monitoring; Scheduling; Wireless sensor networks; Deadline; Frequency-scaling; Hybrid; Pre-emption; Reliable; Scheduler; Time triggered; Token; Real time systems,"Hemalatha, V.; SRM UniversityIndia; email: hemalatha955@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021758958

In such monitoring systems, the sensor nodes at the network boundary require remaining vigilant to detect events like objects entering and leaving the area under surveillance. Nodes performing surveillance of target area can be classified as boundary node and others as an interior node. Due to continuous vigilance, boundary node suffers from quicker energy exhaustion (compare to internal nodes) which results to a shorter life span of the node. None of the reported works on boundary detection algorithms have considered the problem of maximizing the lifetime of boundary nodes. The problem of maximizing the lifetime of boundary nodes collectively addresses the problem of an optimal number of boundary nodes detection and maximization of boundary node's lifetime. In this work, we formulate the problem of the maximum lifetime of the boundary as the problem of partitioning the boundary region of the network into disjoint dominating sets of a boundary region with the aim of maximizing the number of disjoint dominating sets of a boundary region in the network. This is the problem of the domatic partition of boundary region in graph theory, where each partition is dominating the set of boundary region (i.e., not the dominating set of entire network). Rotating the disjoint dominating sets of boundary region in the network resulting into maximizing the lifetimes of boundary nodes. We found that our disjoint dominating sets of boundary region algorithm have an approximation ratio ((4.8+ln5)opt+1.2), where opt is the minimum size dominating set which has the same approximation ratio as the minimum dominating set problem. The time complexity of boundary detection algorithm is O(mn2) where m=|Euk?1|, n=|Nuk?1| and k is the radius of graph. Simulation results reveal that using our proposed domatic partition of boundary region algorithm, the boundary node saves 35.71% energy lesser as compared to without domatic partition based boundary detection algorithm. To support our claim, we extended our work one step further and performed the experimental analysis of our proposed algorithm on telosb motes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Distributed sensor networks; Pervasive computing; Surveillance,Approximation algorithms; Complex networks; Distributed computer systems; Graph theory; Monitoring; Object detection; Sensor nodes; Signal detection; Space surveillance; Ubiquitous computing; Approximation ratios; Boundary detection algorithms; Disjoint dominating sets; Distributed sensor networks; Experimental analysis; Minimum dominating set; Monitoring system; Network boundaries; Wireless sensor networks,"Shukla, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jaypee University of Information TechnologyIndia; email: shailendra.shukla@juit.ac.in",,Academic Press Inc.,7437315,,JPDCE,,English,J.

Ensuring optimal lifetime of a sensor network has always been a research question from the past decade with evidences of various ranges of solutions to mitigate them. However, till now such energy preservation solutions were not found to be effective. Another unique pattern observed from literatures is that majority of such techniques are cluster based which causes latency in data fusion mechanism. Therefore, this paper has discussed a tree-based data fusion technique using an extra module termed as core fusion node, which ensures energy aware and non-redundant data to be fused by the fusion node and then transmit to the base station using multiple-hops.

There is a variant of coverage problem called ?-coverage, where a fraction of targets allowed to be left uncovered to provide partial coverage. This variant of coverage is presented by Maximum Network ?-Lifetime Problem (?-MLP) that is the special case of classical MLP. During ?-coverage, there has been no choice over targets which are going to be left uncovered, instead, a random set of targets are left uncovered. If we can wisely select the set of targets which are going to be left uncovered, then, the network lifetime can be prolonged further. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient heuristic to solve ?-MLP. Our heuristic not only supports partial coverage, but, it also put a valuable observation on the targets which are left uncovered.

The first method uses RFID for unique node identification and the second method detects replica by identifying its locality based on received signal strength (RSSI) and Triangulation method.

Normally, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network gets fragmented. To mitigate this issue, we propose a three phase energy balanced zone based routing protocol. Specifically, in the first phase the region is physically divided into equi-sized zones. In the second phase, a node with minimum traffic and minimum distance from other nodes inside each zone is selected as the zone leader. This leader is responsible for delivering data generated by any node in that zone and for routing and forwarding the data received from other zone leaders of the neighbor zones. In the third phase, zones are categorized as non-congested, medium-congested and congested zones and route path is established in inter and intra zones. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the zone congestion levels along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed both at inter and intra zone levels in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 10.5% enhancement in the network throughput, 19.5% energy saving when compared with grid-based multi-path GMCAR with congestion avoidance and 23.03% energy saving when compared with priority-based application-specific congestion control clustering protocol PASCC. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Congestion control; Energy efficient; Gradient value; Wireless Sensor Networks; Zone based routing,Congestion control (communication); Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Application specific; Clustering protocol; Congestion avoidance; Congestion control mechanism; Energy efficient; Experimental evaluation; Performance degradation; Zone-based; Wireless sensor networks,"Sunitha, G.P.; Dept. of ISE, Jawaharlal Nehru National College Of EngineeringIndia; email: sunithagp17@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023172078

This distributed architecture gives rise to issues concerning resilience, node mobility, link failure, routing overhead and drop rate. To avoid these issues and satisfy QoS requirements, a new routing protocol known as clustered QoS routing protocol (CQRP) is proposed. This routing protocol creates a cluster with a grouping of nodes and assigns a cluster head. This cluster head is used to assign an available link for the wireless node to avoid issues with resilience and link failure. Cluster members communicate with data packets through the cluster head. Through the use of this cluster head, quality of service requirements for a distributed network can be met.

However, recent advances in multimedia technology have led to the availability of a wide range of sensors with widely varying capabilities. The introduction of multimedia sensors has presented additional challenges such as requirement of application-specific quality of service (QoS), high bandwidth and low delay. This paper presents an enhanced ant-based QoS-aware routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (EAQHSeN). It is a differentiated service-based QoS routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with multimedia and scalar nodes. We have used bio-inspired routing heuristics, and the key feature of the protocol is its ability to meet diverse QoS requirements claimed by heterogeneous traffic generated by the nodes. The routing decision is taken independently for control traffic, scalar traffic and multimedia traffic, thus maximizing the network performance and utilization. Simulation results show that the proposed EAQHSeN protocol performs better than the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol and energy-efficient ant-based routing (EEABR) protocol. The average percentage improvement in minimum residual energy by EAQHSeN over EEABR is approximately 4 % which is an indication of extended lifetime. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Ant routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor network; Heuristic function; Multimedia packets; QoS routing; Scalar packets,Energy efficiency; Heuristic algorithms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routers; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Ant routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Heuristic functions; Multimedia packets; QoS routing; Scalar packets; Sensor nodes,"Woungang, I.; Department of Computer Science, Ryerson UniversityCanada; email: iwoungan@scs.ryerson.ca",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987608817

To achieve this, we propose a variant of the DCP technique with autonomous constellation selection at the different SNs. In the first stage of the two-stage time division duplexed cophasing scheme, the SNs obtain estimates of the channels to the FC using pilot symbols transmitted by the latter. Following this, the SNs simultaneously transmit their data symbols prerotated according to the estimated channel phases to combine coherently at the FC. The symbols transmitted by different SNs are drawn from possibly different constellations selected based on the estimated instantaneous channel gains. We show that this scheme is equivalent to transmitting symbols from hierarchical constellations. Based on the properties of hierarchical constellations, we develop recursive expressions for the BER of the proposed system. Following this, we use the properties of the effective channel coefficients to show that it is possible to recover the transmitted data bits from the signal received at the FC blindly, without requiring explicit pilot symbols to be sent by the power-starved SNs. We develop three blind channel estimation and data detection schemes for the presented system model. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed blind channel estimation algorithm achieves a probability of error performance close to that with genie aided perfect channel state information (CSI) at the FC, while using only a moderate number of unknown data symbols for channel estimation. © 1991-2012 IEEE.",adaptive Modulation; blind channel estimation; data fusion; Distributed co-phasing; hierarchical constellations; wireless sensor networks,Adaptive modulation; Blind equalization; Data fusion; Data integration; Error correction; Errors; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Personnel training; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Testbeds; Wireless sensor networks; Blind channel estimation; Blind equalizer; Co-phasing; Constellation diagrams; Error correction codes; Hierarchical constellation; Channel estimation,"Chopra, R.; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: ribhu@outlook.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1053587X,,ITPRE,,English,IEEE Trans Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028997097

One fundamental application of WSNs is event detection in a Region of Interest (RoI). A set of sensors are deployed to monitor any events inside RoI. In such monitoring applications, both the quality of detection as well as resource requirement in terms of sensors must be optimized while satisfying a certain level of detection guaranty. Therefore, carrying out an optimal sensor deployment is a challenging task for achieving a certain coverage quality with minimum energy consumption and network cost. This paper proposes analytical models for critically analyzing the performance of different deployment techniques to provide insight on the design parameters and system behaviors. Mathematical formulations have been derived to measure the quality of coverage, energy consumption and network cost of geometrical deployment patterns in terms of different metrics; namely, size of RoI, number of sensors and their sensing range. The deployment patterns are modeled by using different shapes of mathematical geometry such square, tri-tilling-hexagon and hexagon. Simulations are carried out using MATLAB considering realistic parameter setting and results are comparatively analyzed for deployment techniques. Analysis of results attests the superiority of Tri Hexagon Tiling (THT) deployment in terms of 2-coverage, energy consumption and network cost to the square and hexagon deployments. In terms of 3-coverage and 4-coverage, hexagon deployment is better as compared to THT and square deployments. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Analytical models; Deployment analysis; Energy consumption; Network cost; Sensor deployment; Wireless sensor networks,Analytical models; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy utilization; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Deployment analysis; Mathematical formulation; Minimum energy consumption; Monitoring applications; Network costs; Resource requirements; Sensor deployment; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Kumar, S.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: skdohare@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020751051

Session key establishment between the sensor node and the user is also required for secure communication. In this paper, we perform the security analysis of A.K.Das's user authentication scheme (given in 2015), Choi et al.'s scheme (given in 2016), and Park et al.'s scheme (given in 2016). The security analysis shows that their schemes are vulnerable to various attacks like user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack and attacks based on legitimate users. Based on the cryptanalysis of these existing protocols, we propose a secure and efficient authenticated session key establishment protocol which ensures various security features and overcomes the drawbacks of existing protocols. The formal and informal security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol withstands the various security vulnerabilities involved in WSNs. The automated validation using AVISPA and Scyther tool ensures the absence of security attacks in our scheme. The logical verification using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic confirms the correctness of the proposed protocol. Finally, the comparative analysis based on computational overhead and security features of other existing protocol indicate that the proposed user authentication system is secure and efficient. In future, we intend to implement the proposed protocol in real-world applications of WSNs and IoT. © 2017 by the authors.",Fuzzy extractor; Hash function; Internet of Things (IoT); Session key; Smart card; User authentication; Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs),Authentication; Computation theory; Cryptography; Hash functions; Internet of things; Quality of service; Security systems; Sensor nodes; Smart cards; Wireless sensor networks; Fuzzy extractors; Internet of Things (IOT); Session key; User authentication; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security,"Maurya, A.K.; Center for Mobile Banking, Institute for Development and Research in Banking TechnologyIndia; email: anupmaurya88@gmail.com",,MDPI AG,20782489,,,,English,Information,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033673462

Advances made in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the merging of advanced electronic and wireless technologies.

This research work introduces a new model, IBE-ECC that administers the energy of sensor nodes with faster authentication process. Signature verification model is deployed to achieve faster authentication process. Nevertheless, the public key-based strategies eliminate the security process but their verification process takes larger time. Therefore, authentication speed is a major constraint of our research endeavor. The proposed scheme is design to achieve high security and fast authentication with energy efficiency. It uses identity-based encryption on elliptic curve cryptography and a user authentication with an energy efficient key management. Further, to improve the speed of the authentication, it reduces the signature size so that it would accelerate signature verification faster. Hence, the proposed scheme will provide a secure key management, energy efficiency, fast authentication and additionally, computation overhead and communication costs are minimized.

Clustering is either classified as static and dynamic or as equal and unequal. In cluster based routing protocols that employ multi-hop communication, imbalanced energy consumption among the nodes results in hot-spots. Unequal clustering overcomes hot-spots but requires a high overhead and is prone to connectivity issues. To offer guaranteed connectivity and alleviate the hot-spot problem, a zone divisional hierarchical routing protocol has been proposed in this paper. The network is divided into equal sized static rectangular clusters which are assigned to two zones namely near zone and far zone. The zone facing the base station is known as the near zone and rest of the network space makes up the far zone which is further divided into sub-zones. Dual cluster heads approach for sharing the reception, aggregation and forwarding tasks is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol against the existing protocols reveals that the method offers energy-efficient multi-hop communication support, uses negligible overhead, prevents creation of hot-spots, avoids early death of nodes, uses balanced energy consumption across the network and maximizes the network lifetime. © 2016 IEEE.",clustering; hot-spots; multi-hop; network lifetime,Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Balanced energy consumption; Cluster based routing protocols; clustering; Communication bandwidth; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hot spot; Multihop; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks,,Tomar G.S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The efficiency of the WSN depends on the numerous performance parameter of the network. A lifetime of network and energy consumption is the most important parameters in the design of a WSN.

WSN consists of small nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. In WSN, clustering is used as an effective technique to achieve scalability, self-organization, power saving, channel access, routing etc. Lifetime of sensor nodes determines the lifetime of the network and is crucial for the sensing capability. Clustering is the key technique used to extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In this proposed method, the node next to the present cluster head is selected as the new cluster head if its energy is greater than the threshold energy. Moreover all the nodes used in this method are mobile nodes. Mobile nodes increases the scope of gathering updated information. Mobile nodes also have a chance of entering remote area where cluster head cannot reach them. In this case the nodes die. In the proposed method this problem is solved, whenever the nodes tends to move out of the cluster, the nodes generates a random angle to which it is redirected. This approach will increase the network lifetime and will provide high throughput. © 2017 IEEE.",Clustering; Mobile Nodes; Network; Routing; Scalability; Wireless Communication,Network routing; Networks (circuits); Routing protocols; Scalability; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clustering; Mobile nodes; Mobile sensor networks; Routing; Self organizations; Updated informations; Wireless communication capabilities; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks,,Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Ind.

Coverage holes are the fundamental issue which affects the quality of the WSNs. Only if the coverage holes are detected, they are patched using sensor nodes known as healing. It is not possible to find the coverage holes manually. Therefore the coverage hole, detecting and healing have become a major challenges in order to achieve the best coverage of the WSNs. For this purpose, we proposed the algorithm named as a Delaunay Triangulation merged with the virtual edge based method; it helps to detect the coverage holes in WSNs.

In the UWB literature, non-coherent energy detector (ED) receiver is proposed to reduce receiver implementation complexity by avoiding the complex channel estimation process and relaxing the precise synchronization requirement. However, the ED receiver performance is sensitive to the integration interval, and too large or small value of integration interval degrades the UWB receiver performance. In this paper, we propose a non-coherent UWB receiver by exploiting the cluster-sparsity of the received UWB signal. The proposed receiver structure enhances the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver output as compared to the ED by barring inter-clusters noise accumulation. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed non-coherent receiver for time-hopping binary pulse position modulation UWB system is analyzed using IEEE 802.15.4a channel.

With the wireless interfaces, these will communicate with one another just in case of cooperative communication in single or multiple hops. Multiple nodes are required for co-operative communication where the Stable Enable Protocol (SEP) and SEP-Vector Quantization (SEP-V) is used for cluster and active cluster head (CH) formation. Further Dijkstra Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the active cluster heads (CHs) and high energy utilization respectively. The main issue of inter-cluster communication is carried out in earlier work using SEP and SEP-V protocols. The proposed work illustrates the SEP-Vector Quantization Dijkstra (SEP-VD) protocol, for shortest path active cluster head (CH) communication on a Cooperative communication network. From the applications point of view, SEP-VD determines the lowest energy path. SEP-V provides the intra-cluster communication between the cluster head and nodes.

Sensors nodes are energy constraints devices. For the sustainability of sensor networks energy optimization is the prime challenge for researchers which can be achieved by efficient design of clustering routing protocols. LEACH is one of the most renowned hierarchical routing protocols which prepare the fields for many other routing protocols for WSN. An enhanced version of LEACH is the EEEAC protocol which is an adaptive clustering based on residual energy of each node and generated uniform cluster heads over the network. Unlike EEEAC which considers unique identification of subarea code, for locating the nodes position in this paper we use the threshold level of mean link quality of sensor node for sub-area division. This process reduces the cost complexity and size of sensor nodes and non-functioning of GPS within indoor environment for area division. The significant contribution of this work lies in the real test bed implementation of both LEACH and our proposed model under SENSEnuts.

In order to control this air pollution a number of measures are being taken by the government authorities. A number of inspection systems and programs are introduced by the government in which the vehicle has to undergo various amounts of tests and processes in order to examine the vehicle emission responsible for creating vehicle pollution. This air pollution proves to be harmful for the human beings as well as animal and bird species, therefore, creating an ecological imbalance. It is difficult for the government authorities to constantly ask the vehicle owners for checking out their vehicles on a regular basis so as to keep a track of the emission caused due to their vehicles. The government also finds it cumbersome to keep enforcing the vehicle owners on a regular basis for their vehicle test. Moreover, these tests consume very much time and are cost ineffective. And, the vehicle owner finds it a very much hectic as well as a time consuming task to go and check their vehicle engine a number of times for its vehicle emission. Also, the vehicle engine many a times gets over heated and can be responsible for the vehicle failure. There are very few measures taken to alert the owner of the vehicle for overheating of the engine of the vehicle. Thus, this proposed system helps to alert the vehicle owner for his vehicle emission of CO2, LPG gas leakage if the vehicle is being operated on gas and engine temperature of the vehicle so as to avoid vehicle failure due to overheating of the vehicle engine. The setup consists of a RF smart card, sensors such as MQ6, LM35 to measure vehicle emission of CO2, LPG leakage, and measurement of engine temperature.

DISS-X is similar to DISSense with the fact that it provides both the data accumulation and data dissemination services. The qualities of DISSENSE like adaptable active cycle period for reducing the overall duty cycle and reliable data delivery to the sink have been maintained.

Hence there is a demand of water management system for agriculture which will maximize the crop yield. In this paper a novel approach is made to design and fabricate a closed-loop control system for soil-moisture monitoring and controlling. It is achieved through deployment of proposed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) model in agriculture field. Since the end users are farmers, the cost of the product holds great importance. In market there are many WSN motes available but they are not application specific. The costs of these motes are much higher and beyond the reach of farmers. Due to this reason we have designed new sensor nodes with the help of Arduino Platform and Raspberry Pi module to minimize the cost of entire product. Selection of hardware component, firmware development, integration and field implementation, testing and optimization are the processes that have been followed to develop the product.

In this paper, we have compared mainly the accuracy and time consumed by various prediction schemes using some activation functions. From our analysis, we found that the Rprop-algorithm using logistic activation function is suitable as it provides nearly 97.2 percentage accuracy within an admissible delay of 13 seconds. Our proposed sensor cloud model integrates Rprop-prediction scheme using the logistic activation function in cloud system which predicts future sensor data, such that users request are replied at cloud level which saves energy as number of transmissions are reduced in the sensor network. © 2017 IEEE.",Data prediction; Sensor Cloud; Wireless Sensor Network,Activation analysis; Chemical activation; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Internet of things; Activation functions; Cloud computing environments; Cloud environments; Data prediction; Emerging technologies; Energy efficient; Prediction schemes; RProp algorithms; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

MWSNs are much more versatile than the static sensor networks as they can be deployed in any scenario and the sensor nodes are mobile. The sensor nodes have limited computation capability, limited energy and small memory size. In this paper, an Enhanced Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (EEECA) is designed to select the Cluster Head (CH) thereby minimizing the energy consumption.

Efficient data collection is difficult and it depends on routing, power supply and remote location of node. To overcome the routing problem a new Bio-Inspired mechanism Ant Star Fuzzy (ASF) is proposed. ASF is a reliable and dynamic protocol, capable to provide energy efficient, data collecting routing structure in WSN. Network traffic and fast draining of energy of individual node is avoided. So this will increase the life of the network. ASF optimizes the routing paths even in the case of node drop of failure. It provides effective multi-path data transmission and reliable communication. The main objective is to increase the life span of network, during effective data communication in an efficient manner. This paper defines implementation of WSN and comparison of its performance with AODV, ACOAODV routing protocol based on ASF algorithm is done in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput and energy level.

It connects objects such as smart phones, sensors, Light Emitting Diodes (LED) displays, vehicles through the internet allowing them to interact and exchange information among themselves. In today's times IoT has found its application in practically every walk of life and supply chain management is no exception. At present, supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, where suppliers and customers stretch between various countries and continents. The biggest problem faced by manufacturers is to optimize supply chain performance and reduce operational costs over such large geographical stretches. IoT acts as a solution to this problem as it facilitates the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in order to interconnect all the various actors in a supply chain. This humongous network of interconnected devices generate massive amounts of data which is difficult to store and process. Cloud computing here plays a role of a facilitator and provides great help in addressing challenges related to storage and processing capabilities.

One such attack is Node Replication attack, where the attacker creates multiple clones /replicas of the legitimate node and deploys them at various paths in the network. As these replicas behave exactly like legitimate node, it is very difficult to detect them in the network. The presence of replicas mainly aims at disrupting the services of the network, thereby decreasing the performance of the same. Many research works have been carried out to detect the replicas in the network, but still each of the mechanisms have some push-backs. This paper mainly analyses the use of a Zone based routing protocol(ZRP) for Clone detection and how effectively routing can be done even in the presence of a clone in the network. Also it discusses how the performance of the network can be maintained even in the presence of the clone in the network. © 2017 IEEE.",Clone; Node Replication attack; Wireless Sensor Network; ZRP,Cloning; Data communication systems; Embedded systems; Internet protocols; Network routing; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Clone detection; Low costs; Node Replication attack; Zone-based; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In WSN, effective use of energy resource is one of the challenging research issues as the battery limits the lifetime of sensor node. The Rumor Routing has advantages in energy saving by making full use of two features: clustering structure and next-hop scheme. This rumor routing algorithm in WSN allows query source to distribute query to identify source which helps to get timely query message but the energy efficiency is made better using hierarchical method by clustering formation, where the appropriate selection of cluster head reduces energy conservation. So we have fuzzy logic as the proposed method which is based on three features : Centrality, Energy, Distance. The mobile co-ordinator is used in this method to increase the network efficiency. Thus fuzzy logic can effectively avoid the problems that occur in RR and can provide more energy-efficient routing paths. The performance between fuzzy logic using mobile co-ordinator and RR are evaluated by simulations. This simulation results indicate that compared with RR, the fuzzy logic can save energy consumption, provide better path, and increases delivery rate. © 2017 IEEE.",fuzzy logic; Mobile coordinator; RR; WSN,Computer circuits; Data communication systems; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Energy efficient routing; Hierarchical method; Mobile coordinator; Network efficiency; Query message; Real-time application; Research issues; Energy efficiency,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Since most of the energy is consumed for transmitting and receiving data, the energy saving mechanisms plays a vital role in WSNs. One important mechanism to reduce energy consumption in the network is data aggregation. In-network data aggregation removes redundancy as well as unnecessary data forwarding, and hence cuts on the energy used in communications. However such accumulation is known to be profoundly powerless against compromising assaults. Since sensor nodes are typically unattended and without alter safe equipment, they are exceptionally helpless to such assaults.

As Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) eliminates collisions, it is a preferred channel access mechanism. Often multiple sinks are deployed in WSNs. Use of multiple sinks provides fault tolerance and load balancing. In tree based networks, every sink becomes root of exactly one tree. When node deployment is not uniform across the region, some trees become very dense and others are sparse. When scheduling is done, dense tree results in higher schedule length than the sparse one. For aggregated convergecast, schedule length minimization is an important objective. In this work, we have proposed an algorithm which allows every node to decide which sink (i.e. tree) to join such that schedule lengths of trees remain balanced.

This is based on the assumption that one can find overlapping cliques spanning the network. That is, for each sensor, one can identify geometric neighbors for which all inter-sensor ranges are known. Such cliques can be efficiently localized using multidimensional scaling. However, since each clique is localized in some local coordinate system, we are required to register them in a global coordinate system. In other words, our approach is based on transforming the localization problem into a problem of registration. In this context, the main contributions are as follows. First, we describe an efficient method for partitioning the network into overlapping cliques. Second, we study the problem of registering the localized cliques, and formulate a necessary rigidity condition for uniquely recovering the global sensor coordinates. In particular, we present a method for efficiently testing rigidity, and a proposal for augmenting the partitioned network to enforce rigidity. A recently proposed semidefinite relaxation of global registration is used for registering the cliques.

The routing protocol for wireless sensor networks mainly aims in the energy-efficiency of the network. Due to restricted energy, memory, transmission range, power and high traffic load, the nodes which act as a sink get depleted quickly. Because of these so many approaches proposed over past years to reduce energy consumption and to prolong network lifetime. Energy consumption of the network can be reduced by means of using the mobile sink and it also reduces the hotspot problem. Hence Virtual Grid based Data Gathering technique using mobile agent (VGDG-MA) for WSN with mobile sink is proposed. Mobile agent is the one which is used to collect the data by flexibly planning its route. In this paper, virtual grid based data gathering technique using mobile agent is presented that mainly aims to reduce the route construction path frequently in a grid structure. Mobile agent is placed in a multihop environment which automatically clones and migrates based on the environmental changes. Instead of mobile sink, these mobile agents migrate in the environment and collect data, clone when it leaves the particular node results in energy consumption and also reduce the construction cost of the network. Based on residual energy of the node, sink relocates its position and avoids network failure. Proposed method shows that mobile agent can powerfully transfer data from sink to source and source to which results in energy consumption, good packet delivery ratio. Simulation results shows that the proposed VGDG-MA increases the network lifetime and gives better results in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and throughput when compared with other protocols.

The effective packet transmission through wireless senor networks is a quite challenging task as the malicious nodes might often lead to packet loss or corruption which should be avoided by the reliable method of packet transmission. Hence the present research focuses on employing a novel method for secured transmission of data packets. By proposing the communication and threshold based cryptographic mechanism (CTCM), the insider attackers present in the cluster nodes can be considered for enhancing the security of the wireless sensor network. The behavior of malicious node is first located by keeping some monitoring nodes in the communication environment. The monitoring nodes will communicate the information on malicious node to as much nodes as possible for secured data transmission. The secret keys are also shared to other set of sensor nodes. This ensures that the data can be accessed by the node only when it possesses the specific shares unless which the nodes are refrained from sharing their secret key as it is considered malicious. The evaluation of the experimental results are performed in MATLAB simulation environment and compared with the existing approaches in terms of various performance metrics.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithms to determine rendezvous point (RP) based dynamic path for mobile sink called delay aware energy density based trajectory (DAEDT). The DAEDT designs an energy efficient delay bound path for the mobile sink. In order to balance energy consumption among the sensor nodes, the proposed algorithm selects RPs based on the energy density of the sensor nodes. The DAEDT is also presented with a detour criteria following some threshold. The algorithm is extensively simulated and the results of DAEDT are compared with some existing schemes to show its effectiveness over various performance metrics. The simulation results are further validated through hypothesis testing using ANOVA. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany",,Energy utilization; Hole mobility; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Balance energies; Energy efficient; Energy-hole problems; Hypothesis testing; Multi hop communication; Novel algorithm; Performance metrics; Rendezvous point; Energy efficiency,"Nitesh, K.; NIIT UniversityIndia; email: kumarnitesh.ism@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,9467076,,,,English,Microsyst Technol,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031408093

Hierarchical routing protocols are best known for energy efficiency. PDCH is a routing protocol with double cluster head. It elects its cluster head based on the distance from base station. In MBC the cluster head is selected based on the residual energy and mobility. A non-cluster head has to transmit data before its transmission power is finised to the cluater head so with in the TDMA schedule data should be send. Here simulation were conducted in NS2 Software. The QoS parameters that were compared were Delay, Throughput, Packet drop ratio and Energy consumed. From the simulation it was clear that PDCH outperformed MBC by 15.13%, 4.87%, 14.29% and 23.19% for the above parameters. © 2017 IEEE.",Hierarchical routing; LEACH; MBC; mobility; PDCH; PEGASIS; TDMA; WSN,Carrier mobility; Computer network performance evaluation; Computer software; Energy efficiency; Leaching; Optical communication; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hierarchical routings; Packet drop ratios; PDCH; PEGASIS; QoS parameters; Residual energy; Transmission power; Time division multiple access,,,IEEE Computer Society,21517681,9781467392778; 9781509048847,,,English,"IFIP Int.

With the wireless interfaces, these will communicate with one another just in case of cooperative communication in a very single or multiple networks. As multiple nodes are required for cooperative communication, the stable election protocol (SEP) is used for cluster formation. Further Vector Quantization (VQ) is used for analysis of low energy path for the nodes and clusters respectively. The main issue of inter cluster node communication is carried out in earlier work using SEP protocol. The proposed technique illustrates the SEP-Vector Quantization (SEP-V) protocol, for intra-cluster communication in a cooperative communication network.

Precisely WSNs are well-known in real time applications using homogeneous sensor nodes. As sensor nodes are battery powered, it will become dead after consumption of the battery which decides the lifetime of WSNs. The battery of sensor nodes is neither replaced nor recharged. Hence it is essential to introduce the techniques to prolong the lifetime of the WSNs. Heterogeneous nodes in wireless sensor network is an effective way to increase network lifetime. This involves the need for energy efficiency in heterogeneous WSNs. Limitation on energy is a major concern, and hence it can be managed efficiently using clustering. In homogeneous clustering, each sensor node has equal initial energy but in heterogeneous clustering. There are two or more types of sensor nodes that have different initial energy. This paper describes the various heterogeneous WSN protocols that carry out a survey of the recent clustering protocols for heterogeneous WSNs.

Nowadays, the congestion becomes major cumbersome to degrade the network performance. Due to congestion, some of the significant packets are lost to mitigate the quality. To surmount this congestion issue, the Epsilon constraint-based Adaptive Cuckoo Search Rate Optimization algorithm is proposed. Initially, the occurrence of congestion is detected by incoming packets (traffic) of sensor nodes. Then, the congestion level is determined by virtual queue length. If congestion occurs, then it is fed into the proposed optimization algorithm. In order to find out the optimal value, the fitness function is newly formulated with the aid of Epsilon parameter. Then, the proposed algorithm exploits the new fitness in which the new solution is generated by adjusting the step size adaptively. Finally, the proposed algorithm obtains the best solution where the data is transmitted without congestion. The experimental results and performance is analysed using MATLAB implementation by throughput and sending rate. The performance outcome of proposed algorithm attains 0.99 high throughput value and 0.1 sending rates to enhance the transmission efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.",Adaptive Cuckoo Search; congestion level; Epsilon constraint; Sending rate; WSN network,Adaptive control systems; Internet of things; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Congestion avoidance; Congestion level; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Epsilon constraint; Optimization algorithms; Sending rate; Transmission efficiency; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Since the sensors are constrained by battery power, so lifetime of the network and the energy efficiency becomes a challenging for WSN. To solve this problem many clusters-based routing protocols are proposed like LEACH, TEEN, SEP. This paper deals with Threshold Sensitive Energy Efficient Network Protocol (TEEN) which is a reactive cluster based protocol. It is specially designed for critical application of time. As multiple nodes are required for cooperative communication, TEEN Protocol is used for cluster formation. Further Vector Quantization (VQ) is used for analysis of low energy path for the nodes and clusters respectively. The main issue of inter cluster node communication is carried out in earlier work using TEEN protocol. The proposed technique illustrates the TEEN-Vector Quantization (TEEN-V) protocol, for intra-cluster communication in a cooperative communication network. As per the application point of view, TEEN-V performs the lowest energy path for intra cluster communication. TEEN provides the optimum cluster size and their cluster head and using VQ, the minimum distance is calculated using Euclidean distance between the multiple cluster heads which creates the shortest path results in energy efficient technique. Further the spectral distortion of the proposed technique has been analysed for practical implementation. © 2017 IEEE.",cooperative communication; Energy efficient; TEEN; Vector Quantization; Wireless Sensor Network,Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Vector quantization; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based protocol; Energy efficient; Energy efficient networks; Energy-efficient techniques; Intra-cluster communication; Multiple cluster-heads; Research applications; TEEN; Cooperative communication,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The two important steps in clustering are Cluster formation and Cluster Head (CH) selection. The novel and efficient clustering called Clustering using Eigen Values (CEV) is proposed in this paper with the increased lifetime of the sensor nodes using the spectral graph theory. This work uses the Laplacian matrix of spectral theory for clustering. The Eigen values of Laplacian Matrix and its corresponding eigenvector are used to group the nodes of WSN. CH is selected using fuzzy logic and constraints on energy and distance. This work is evaluated and compared with LEACH and HEED for performance comparison. The results obtained in this work show that the proposed work yields better performance when compared to other existing cluster based techniques based on the parameters such as network lifetime and energy consumption. © 2017 IEEE.,Cluster Formation; Clustering; Eigen values; Eigenvectors; Fuzzy Inference System; Fuzzy Logic; Laplacian Matrix,Computation theory; Computational methods; Computer circuits; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Laplace transforms; Matrix algebra; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster formations; Clustering; Eigen-value; Fuzzy inference systems; Laplacian matrices; Graph theory,,Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Most of the existing systems use the routing techniques which consume lot of energy during data communication. Hence, the energy of sensor nodes depletes and results in decrease its lifetime. To overcome the above limitation in this paper we propose a new routing technique called agent based fuzzy swarm optimization (FSO) routing technique which provides dynamic clustering and effective optimized routing. Because of this technique the energy of sensor nodes has been conserved and used effectively which ultimately increases the lifetime of the network. The proposed system has been implemented by using MATLAB and for correctness purpose the results are taken after repeated measurement. © 2017 IEEE.",Dynamic Clustering; Efficient Routing; Fuzzy Swarm Optimization; Intelligent Agent; Particle Swarm Optimization; Wireless Sensor Network,Computation theory; Computational methods; Data communication systems; Intelligent agents; Network routing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Data-communication; Dynamic clustering; Efficient routing; Multi hop communication; Optimized routing; Repeated measurements; Routing techniques; Swarm optimization; Wireless sensor networks,,Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

To facilitate ease of deployment and keeping the cost to a minimum we focus on devising a target tracking system based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We adopt a model based approach in which the targets are assumed to evolve in time according to a certain maneuver model and the deployed sensors record RSSI measurements governed by an appropriate observation model. To devise an accurate target tracking algorithm, that would account for the radio environment, we use mixed maximum likelihood (ML)-Bayesian framework. Under this framework the radio environment is estimated using the ML approach and the target tracking is accomplished using a Bayesian filtering technique namely, particle filtering. Next to create a distributed tracking algorithm which warrants that every sensor node has access to RSSI measurements of all the other sensor nodes we introduce a dissemination mechanism for the same based on the technique of random linear network coding (RLNC). In this technique every sensor node encodes RSSI measurements that it has received from other nodes (including its own) to create a network coded packet, which in turn is transmitted using the carrier-sense multiple access based access mechanism. Our simulation results demonstrate that the root mean square tracking error (RMSE) obtained by using RLNC is strictly lower than what was achieved with a competing scheme based on localized aggregation. This can be attributed to the rapid dissemination capability of the RLNC technique. Further, the growth of RMSE in a strongly connected network with noise variance was found to be much slower than in the case of a weakly connected network. This points to the potential of RLNC in improving tracking performance, especially in strongly connected networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Bayesian filtering and EM algorithm; Network coding; Wireless sensor networks,Bayesian networks; Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Clutter (information theory); Codes (symbols); Linear networks; Maximum likelihood; Sensor nodes; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Distributed tracking; EM algorithms; Random Linear Network Coding; Received signal strength indicators; Root mean square tracking error; Target tracking algorithm; Target tracking systems; Weakly connected networks; Network coding,"Pillutla, L.S.; Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Post Bag 4, Near Indroda Circle, India; email: laxminarayana_pillutla@daiict.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014290894

However, in a hierarchical cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving and aggregating the data from their member sensor nodes and transmitting the aggregated data to the base station. Therefore, the proper selection of CHs plays vital role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient cluster head selection algorithm which is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) called PSO-ECHS. The algorithm is developed with an efficient scheme of particle encoding and fitness function. For the energy efficiency of the proposed PSO approach, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. We also present cluster formation in which non-cluster head sensor nodes join their CHs based on derived weight function. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs, varying number of sensor nodes and the CHs. The results are compared with some existing algorithms to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",CH-selection; Energy consumption; NP-hard; Particle swarm optimization; Wireless sensor networks,Algorithms; Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; CH-selection; Cluster formations; Cluster-head selections; Efficient schemes; Fitness functions; Hierarchical clusters; NP-hard; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Rao, P.C.S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: vasu.piit@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964318544

The frequent faults and failures sometime create large holes causing loss of sensing and connectivity coverage in the network. In present work, a zone based failure detection and recovery scheme is presented to reliably handle such node failures. We first propose a consensus and agreement based approach to elect a suitable monitor node called as zone monitor (ZM). ZM is responsible for coordinating failure recovery activities and maintaining desired coverage within a zone. In order to overcome failure overhead due to false failure detection, a consensus is carried out amongst neighboring nodes of a suspicious node to confirm the correct status with high accuracy. On confirmation of a node failure, the impact of resulting hole on coverage is analyzed and if impact exceeds beyond a particular threshold, a recovery process is initiated. The recovery process utilizes backup nodes having overlapping sensing coverage with failed node and may also relocate some nodes. Firstly a backup node is probed and activated if available. If no backup node is found, the solution strives to recover coverage jointly by recursively relocating some mobile nodes and probing backup nodes. The proposed scheme is analyzed and validated through NS-2 based simulation experiments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Connectivity; Coverage; Failure diagnosis; Failure recovery; Wireless sensor network,Computer system recovery; Distributed computer systems; Recovery; Sensor nodes; Connectivity; Connectivity coverages; Coverage; Failure detection; Failure detection and recoveries; Failure Diagnosis; Failure recovery; Neighboring nodes; Wireless sensor networks,"Sharma, K.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kpsharma17vce@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968638573

Energy efficiency and bit error rate (BER) performance are the basic criteria to be taken into account while designing an optimal error correction scheme for WSNs. In this paper, a novel energy efficient error control scheme is proposed which minimizes the energy overheads of a typical error control scheme such as additional bits transmit energy and encoding/decoding energy, while achieving a better BER performance compared to the standard schemes. The redundant bits transmit energy is saved by incorporating compression and coding energy is minimized by employing simpler operations compared to other schemes. Further,the proposed scheme is validated in the context of mica2 motes. The BER performance and energy consumption of the presented scheme are studied and compared with standard error control schemes,such as, Hamming (7, 4) and RS (31, 29).

Designing energy-aware routing protocol can significantly reduce energy consumption in WSNs. Grouping of sensor nodes into clusters is a proficient routing technique for reducing the energy depletion of the nodes in the WSN. In this work, a novel multi-branch tree based clustering approach is proposed to extend the lifetime of the WSNs. A number of branches and selection of cluster heads are performed based on the independent neighbour set properties of nodes. For this, a maximum of five branches constructed by the algorithm and these branches are grown to different direction using the nature of INS. In this approach, inter-cluster communication distance is drastically minimized and evenly distributed the energy consumption of nodes over the network. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the traditional existing methods in terms of cluster structure, nodes energy distribution and network lifetime through the extensive simulations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Energy Efficient routing; Load distribution; Multi-branch clustering; Wireless sensor networks,Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Ion beams; Network routing; Power management; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Unattended sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Energy aware routing protocols; Energy efficient routing; Extensive simulations; Intercluster communication; Load distributions; Multi-branch clustering; Reduce energy consumption; Unattended wireless sensor networks; Power management (telecommunication),"Alphonse, P.J.A.; Department of Computer Applications, National Institute of Technology (NIT)India; email: alphonse@nitt.edu",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019660545

In almost all applications of Wireless Sensor Networks, event detection information is required along with the location of the event. Thus, to find the location of event, node localization plays an important role. Many researchers have put tremendous efforts in designing localization algorithms. In the literature, it is confirmed that DV-Hop algorithm and its variants are the most suitable range-free based algorithms for node localization, due to its cost effectiveness, simplicity and feasibility for medium to large scale networks, but these algorithms consume very high energy. The DV-Hop algorithm works in three phases. The first phase allows all the nodes to get their distance from few localized nodes called anchors in terms of hop. The hop is the count of neighboring nodes between two nodes. Then in second phase, the anchor nodes find out their approximate distances from every node. The third phase computes the location of node using the information obtained from first two phases and by applying trilateration method. The high energy is consumed due to transmission of large number of packets in the first two phases by anchor nodes. In order to reduce communication overhead of the first two phase of DV-Hop, an improved DV-Hop is proposed that considers only k-hop transmission of the anchor packet which reduces the communication overheads to the large extent. Simulation experiments and results prove that the proposed method reduces the energy consumption by approximately 50% compare to the traditional DV-Hop algorithm.",DV-hop; Localization; Threshold; Wireless sensor networks,,,,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,21801843,,,,English,J.

Due to recent advancement, various applications are being upgraded using sensor networks. Generally, traffic consists of delay sensitive and delay tolerant applications. Handling such traffic simultaneously is a critical challenge in IEEE 802.15.4 sensor network. However, the standard CSMA/CA does not focus on traffic-based data delivery. Therefore, this paper presents a solution for priority-based traffic over no-priority i.e. regular traffic using CSMA/CA IEEE 802.15.4 MAC sublayer. The VSRS scheduler uses a queuing model for scheduling incoming traffic at an actor node using a dual queue. The scheduler updates priority of each incoming packet dynamically using network priority weight metric. The VSRS scheduler scans queues and picks the highest network priority packet. A packet weight is updated after selection from the respective queue. This core operation of an actor node offers good packet delivery ratio, throughput, and less delay experience of long distance traveled packets against no priority traffic. The work is validated using theoretical analysis and computer generated network simulators; proves that the priority based approach using weight factor works better over the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) mechanism.",Deadline; Priority; Reliability; Reliable data transmission; Scheduling; Transport; Wireless sensor networks,,,,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,21801843,,,,English,J.

The most important need for WSNs is energy efficient routing protocol that consumes optimal energy. It provides extension to the networks life period. Nowadays a number of energy efficient routing protocols are proposed by various researchers in WSNs. However, security and energy efficiency in data collection and transmission in WSNs should be simultaneously considered for security challenges and to overcome limitation of WSNs. In this paper, we propose a new and effective routing protocol named, Intelligent Energy Aware Secured Algorithm for Routing (IEASAR) which is secure by using a Trust based approach and is Energy efficient at the same time. For this purpose, a new energy efficient protocol using Fuzzy C-means has been proposed in this paper. Moreover, a modified minimum spanning tree approach is applied here to identify the minimum distance path between the sender node and the destination node and hence an optimal and secured routing path is selected.

In this standpoint, we propose two perspectives for diagnosing and alleviating anomalies. The first view depicts input space partitioning by subtractive clustering method with robust density measure.

Hence, the network consumes more energy which is the main and challenging issue in WSNs. Since the sensor is operating under battery, recharging is impossible and hence the lifetime of each sensor is an important issue. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new and efficient techniques to extend the network lifetime. In this paper, a new delay constrained energy efficient routing technique is proposed for performing effective routing in WSNs. This approach introduces a delay constraint based reliable routing approach which reduces the energy consumption by constructing efficient clusters without increasing the end-to-end delay. Moreover, the proposed technique called the rule based clustering for routing model provides better performance in terms of network lifetime than the other existing techniques since they consume more energy during the formation of clusters and finding the shortest path. Moreover, additional overhead on the cluster head selection is tackled also using rules in this proposed model in an efficient manner by building balanced clusters. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it extends the lifetime of the network and increases the throughput, energy efficiency, link quality and scalability. The experimental verification of this technique has been carried out using MATLAB simulations and proved that this model increases the packet delivery rate, network performance and reduces the delay and energy consumption. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Cluster head; Data gathering; Depth First Search routing; Energy efficiency; TED based clustering; Wireless sensor network,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Based clustering; Cluster head; Cluster-head selections; Constrained energy; Data gathering; Depth first search; Experimental verification; Matlab simulations; Wireless sensor networks,"Velvizhy, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University, CEG Campus, India; email: velvizhy@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029789284

There are various key predistribution schemes (KPS in short) for wireless sensor network proposed earlier. Closest Pair KPS (CPKS) is such a scheme, which was first proposed by D. Liu and P. Ning and is used when sensor node location is known prior to deployment. In their scheme, they assign pairwise keys with a set of sensor nodes whose expected position are closest to the expected position of the sensor node. Here in this paper, we propose an improvement over traditional CPKS by neighbour node connectivity prediction technique to enhance probability of key share among nodes.

The development of aeronautical single channel and multichannel ultrasonic data communication system is discussed in this paper. Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) followed by Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is implemented successfully. Single channel of bandwidth 1 KHz were used allowing 8 bits of data packet transferred from the transmitter to the receiver concurrently. The rate of data transfer achieved was up to 1 kb/s. A model was designed during the work which could anticipate ultrasonic signals. The carrier frequency of data transmission was 40 KHz. The BitError Rate(BER) of the system was analyzed for different distances. The maximum distance of communication was 1 meter. Through the model designed we have transmitted image data, audio data and text data and received successfully. Further the source point was replaced with multipoint for application of Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) and show that multipoint point communication is possible with a rate of 327 b/s.

But like other wireless networks WSN is also prone to adversary interventions. So the researchers are addressing this issue to make routing protocols secure for communication. But due to the severe resource constraints on sensor nodes like limited battery life and limited storage capacity prevents the traditional complex security mechanisms to be employed on the sensor nodes. In this paper we propose a new routing algorithm called Secure Energy Aware Multipath Routing with Key Management (SEAM-KM) in Wireless Sensor Network. This protocol focuses on using a base station as the central control block for all kinds of computation like shortest path selection, routing table generation, Updating the routing table and distribution of pair wise keys among the sensor nodes and the base station. Leaving the energy consuming computations to be performed by the base station, the lifetime of the sensor nodes can be prolonged. Moreover distribution of pair wise keys among sensor nodes provides security among sensor nodes and also increases the resilience of the network. This protocol is resistive to some of the specific attacks which rely on forming attractive routes to lure the sensor nodes to communicate through the already compromised nodes. © 2017 IEEE.",Dijkstra's algorithm; Energy efficiency; Key Management; Multipath routing; Security,Base stations; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Network security; Power management; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; Critical environment; Dijkstra's algorithms; Key management; Multi path routing; Resource Constraint; Security; Security mechanism; Power management (telecommunication),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Medical and healthcare systems find a variety of applications with the tremendous growth of WSNs. The wireless body area network (WBAN) is the emerging technology which has high impact on the society and also in the field of medical as well as non-medical sector. This WBAN is a network with a special purpose that has been designed for operating in an autonomous manner and connect the various medical sensors as well as the appliances that are located inside and also outside the human body. The network also enables physicians for monitoring remotely as well as monitoring the vital signs of the patients also provide some real time feedback for the consultations and diagnosis. This WBAN system will offer two other significant advantages which are patient mobility owing to the use of some portable monitoring devices and also a location independent facility of monitoring. By having appealing dimensions this can bring about a set of challenges that will not be normally taken into consideration. It may need a scalable network that will have some heterogeneous traffic of data with a low power consumption in that of the sensor nodes with the integration either in or around the body of networking.

Hybrid energy-efficient distributed (HEED) protocol is one of the prominent clustering protocol in WSNs. However, it has few shortcomings, i.e., cluster heads (CHs) variation in consecutive rounds, more work load on CHs, uneven energy dissipation by sensor nodes, and formation of hot spots in network. By resolving these issues, one can enhance HEED capabilities to a greater extent. We have designed variants of Optimized HEED (OHEED) protocols named as HEED-1 Tier chaining (HEED1TC), HEED-2 Tier chaining (HEED2TC), ICHB-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICOH1TC), ICHB-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICOH2TC), ICHB-FL-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICFLOH1TC), and ICHB-FL-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICFLOH2TC) protocols. In HEED1TC and HEED2TC protocols, we have used chain-based intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication in HEED, respectively, for even load balancing among sensor nodes and to avoid more work load on CHs. Furthermore, for appropriate cluster formation, minimizing CHs variation in consecutive rounds and reducing complex uncertainties, we have used bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA)-inspired proposed intelligent CH selection based on BFOA (ICHB) algorithm for CH selection in ICOH1TC and ICOH2TC protocols. Likewise, in ICFLOH1TC and ICFLOH2TC protocols, we have used novel fuzzy set of rules additionally for CH selection to resolve the hot spots problem, proper CH selection covering whole network, and maximizing the network lifetime to a great extent.

Variety of computational intelligence techniques including evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, artificial immune systems and recently, artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic have been applied for efficient clustering in WSNs. Due to ease of use and adaptive nature, ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs. However, its search equation contributes to its insufficiency due to comparably poor exploitation cycle and requirement of certain control parameters. Thus, we propose an improved artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve exploitation capabilities of existing metaheuristic. Further, to enhance the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Students t-distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store and therefore increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements; moreover, the use of first-of-its-kind compact Students t-distribution makes it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Additionally, an energy-efficient clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is presented, which inherits the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads along with an optimal base station location to improve energy efficiency in WSNs.

With the popularity of the Internet of Things in recent years, source privacy protection has attracted a lot of attentions. In order to mitigate this threat, many proposals show their merits. However, they fail to get the tradeoff between multi-path transmission and transmission cost. In this paper, we propose a constrained random routing mechanism, which can constantly change routing next-hop instead of a relative fixed route so that attackers cannot analyze routing and trace back to source nodes. First, we design a specific selection domain which is located around the sending node according to the dangerous distance and the wireless communication range. Then sending nodes calculate the selected weights of the candidate nodes according to their offset angles in this domain. Finally, the selected weights help to decide which node will become the next hop. In this way, attackers would be confused by the constantly changing paths.

The number of trees has reduced drastically from the forest that creates an unhealthy environment for animals to survive in the forest.

GATA combined Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [1] and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies to solve the above mentioned problem. Wild animals straying out of wildlife sanctuaries and natural parks have been tracked by auto generative location tracking and movement patterns. Automatic location and movement tracking has been implemented using GPS with the accelerometer and the WiFi shield. In the event of straying of a wild animal out of the predefined zone of sanctuary or natural reserve, an alert is sounded on a fixed base station (BS). As a prototype, we have tested this hardware on the cows, which shows that the proposed approach is very efficient in terms of flexibility and cost.

One of the methods to solve this problem is to activate only a few sensors which satisfy the coverage constraints. This can be done by partitioning a set of all sensors into many subsets or sensor covers such that each sensor cover satisfies the coverage constraints and activating them subsequently which leads to increase the network lifetime. A memetic algorithm is proposed in this paper for the Q-Coverage problem where each target can be covered by one or more sensors. The cardinal objective of the proposed algorithm is to maximize the lifespan of the network while satisfying the coverage constraints. The proposed algorithm avoids redundancy and utilizes the available resources to maximize the network lifetime.

A topology control scheme is proposed, in which the sink node, which acts as the leader, identifies the set of jamming affected nodes. On the other hand, the sensor nodes, which act as followers, need to decide an optimum transmission power level, while ensuring an optimal set of neighbor nodes covered. A scheme, named TC-JAM, for ensuring packet delivery ratio, while avoiding jammers and increasing network lifetime in wireless sensor networks, is proposed. In existing literatures, the sensor nodes are envisioned to be equipped with multiple interfaces, while having access for multiple channels. However, in TC-JAM, the sensor nodes have simple hardware with single interface for communication, ie, the sensor nodes have single channel for communication. Additionally, in the proposed scheme, TC-JAM, each sensor node has a provision to vary its transmission power according to the chosen strategies. Using TC-JAM, the energy consumption of the overall network reduces by up to 62%, and the network lifetime increases by 56% to 73%.

In clustered WSNs, network is partitioned into set of clusters, each having a coordinator called cluster head (CH), which collects data from its cluster members and forwards it to the base station (BS) via other CHs. Clustered WSNs often suffer from the hot spot problem where CHs closer to the BS die much early because of high energy consumption contributed by the data forwarding load. Such death of nodes results coverage holes in the network very early. In most applications of WSNs, coverage preservation of the target area is a primary measure of quality of service. Considering the energy limitation of sensors, most of the clustering algorithms designed for WSNs focus on energy efficiency while ignoring the coverage requirement. In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm that uses fuzzy logic to establish a trade-off between the energy efficiency and coverage requirement. This algorithm considers both energy and coverage parameters during cluster formation to maximize the coverage preservation of target area. Further, to deal with hot spot problem, it forms unequal sized clusters such that more CHs are available closer to BS to share the high data forwarding load. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is compared with some of the well-known existing algorithms under different network scenarios. The simulation results validate the superiority of our algorithm in network lifetime, coverage preservation, and energy efficiency.

Rendezvous points are the locations in the network where the mobile sink halts and collects data from the nearby sensor nodes. However, the selection of RPs for the design of path has a significant impact on timely data collection from the network.

The nodes in the network are resource constrained in nature and faces several challenges for producing the data from the unfriendly environment. Large amount of data is generated from WSN and suffers from data fault, inaccuracy and inconsistency. To increase the reliability of application, several data trust management schemes are introduced to ensure the trustworthiness of data in decision making process. Apart from these schemes, in the absence of ground truth, sensor data models are used to find the trustiness of the sensor data. The data generated from the simulation of data model is used as a metric to evaluate the degree of trustiness of sensor data. The existing sensor data models suffer from high energy consumption for data trustiness detection and it becomes inaccurate when the data fault rate is high. In this paper, we are proposing an energy efficient sensor data model for evaluating the sensor data trustworthiness and reconstruct the sensor data in case of any data loss and data fault.

In order to maintain these metrics, the issue of finding and healing of coverage hole is closely related to these two facts and plays a vital role in the performance improvement of the network. Many works in the past explored for 2D-WSNs, but now the time has come to investigate this matter for 3D-WSNs to reach the new heights of research and technology. In this paper, different scenarios with respect to the deployment of sensor nodes or network topology with the presence of different shaped coverage holes are discussed. Not only this, to heal these perceived holes introduction of sensor nodes having sensing radius different from initial deployed sensors has been suggested which in turn outlines the development of heterogeneous sensor networks, a keen issue with respect to technology development. This deployment of sensors to constitute heterogeneous sensor networks also influences the overall network cost in terms of cost reduction with an optimum coverage level. A mathematical analysis to give a relationship between the radii of former and later deployed sensor nodes is presented in the form of theorem.

Further in this paper, we have re-defined the medium access protocol for cluster heads. The proposed medium access protocol is dependent upon the data traffic at the Cluster heads. Cluster heads with high traffic are given preference to access the channel and cluster head(s) having low traffic are made to wait for comparatively higher back-off time. By giving more time to cluster heads with lower initial data to collect more data, energy efficiency of the system is increased and contention losses are decreased due to reduction in number of transmissions between cluster heads and sink.

Since the wired network and wireless network use the different technologies, there is a necessity of developing new protocols or redesigning of existing protocols. Transmission Control Protocol is redesigned to achieve the reliable and effective communication in the heterogeneous wired-wireless network. The basic assumption made in Transmission Control Protocol is that the packet losses are caused by the network congestion but in case of wireless network, the packet losses may be due to temporary link failure, high Bit-Error-Rate etc. Hence the congestion avoidance algorithm of Transmission Control Protocol needs to be redesigned to cope with heterogeneous wired-wireless network. Therefore in this paper, we propose a congestion avoidance algorithm which differentiates the cause of packet losses. The essential components of proposed algorithm are round-trip-time estimation, backlogged packet estimation, channel status notification, loss differentiation algorithm and congestion window control. A round-trip-time estimation using ARIMA(2,1,1) model is proposed in this paper which estimates the sudden changes in the round trip time. It helps us to estimate the backlogged packet and thereby differentiating the congestive packet loss from non-congestive packet loss. In addition, we use the received signal strength of wireless receiver to differentiate the packet losses.

A compromised sensor node can be used to send fake sensing reports to the sink. If undetected these reports can raise false alarms. To deal with the problem of fake report generation, a number of en-route filtering schemes have been proposed. Each of these schemes uses different cryptographic methods to check the authenticity of reports while they are being forwarded hop by hop toward base station. However, majority of these techniques can handle only limited compromised nodes or they either need node localization or statically configured routes for sending reports.

Invariably, in all these WSN architectures, devising suitable algorithms for the efficient network resources utilization has been a challenging task. In certain events driven scenarios, random arrival pattern of queries generation; their geographical distribution (spatial aspect) and generation rate (temporal aspect) are hard to predict precisely. However, these phenomenons could be appropriately modelled using probabilistic framework while yielding adequate accuracy. Usually, in adopted probabilistic models, the associated control parameters are treated as crisp numbers, which fail to encompass uncertainties that are inevitably associated with the modeled parameters. To include impact of such uncertainties, we propose a modified Poisson PMF expressions in that dependency on spatial and temporal aspects is incorporated based on interval concepts.

The paper presents planar localised Delaunay triangulation (PLDT) based algorithm for self-deployment of sensor nodes for PoI coverage and optimise the data forwarding from PoI to sink. The deployment algorithm used to cover a PoI maintains connectivity all along the deployment. PLDT provides connectivity as well as path robustness compared to relative neighbourhood graphs (RNG) based straight line deployment strategy. But PLDT based path from PoI to sink has more number of hops as against RNG based path. To minimize the number of hops a cross-layer opportunistic robust routing protocol (CORRP) is designed and been used. CORRP uses request-to-sendclear-to-send (RTSCTS) handshaking mechanism to select a forwarder amongst the contending nodes with minimal overheads. Performance of scheme is evaluated for PoI coverage with respect to time and distance.It is observed that the scheme adequately covers the PoI in finite time. The upper and lower bound on number of hops under zero loss and network failure conditions are estimated. Compared to RNG-based straight line deployment, simulation results show that PLDT deployment with CORRP exhibits better performance in the range of 4010% for energy consumption and 12% for packet reception approximately for increasing value of node sleeping probability. Also the energy consumption under lossy links is less by 40% compared to RNG-based straight line deployment. Thus PLDT based deployment and forwarding with CORRP exhibits improvement for energy consumption, packet reception and ensures robustness. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Mobile wireless sensor networks; Point of interest; Robust opportunistic routing,Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Delau-nay triangulations; Deployment algorithms; Deployment strategy; Mobile wireless sensor network; Neighbourhood graphs; Opportunistic routing; Point of interest; Upper and lower bounds; Wireless sensor networks,"Karyakarte, M.S.; Vishwakarma Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: karyakarte.ms@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020080950

However, they suffer from the requirement of larger silicon area, inductors with high quality factor, large number of off-chip decoupling capacitors, high input power, voltage stress handling capability and efficiency degradation due to finite on-resistance and surplus capacitance of switching transistors. In order to overcome these limitations and to enhance the power added efficiency, two novel two-stage class-E power amplifiers denoted as PA1 and PA2 are proposed in this paper. Both the amplifiers use a driver amplifier with capacitive feedback and pi-matching at the input. PA1 uses a main amplifier with negative-capacitance cascode topology. PA2 uses a diode connected NMOS auxiliary transistor with RC source degeneration in the driver amplifier, negative-capacitance cascode configuration with a parallel LC-tuning circuit in the main amplifier. To evaluate the efficacy of these circuits, the proposed power amplifiers are implemented in UMC 0.18-µm standard RFCMOS process with the supply voltage of 3.0 V and the operating frequency of 2.45 GHz and studied through post-layout simulation using Cadence Virtuoso (IC616) Analog Design Environment. From this study, it is found that the proposed power amplifiers have the power added efficiency of (45.02 %, 54.87 %), the saturated output power at 1-dB compression point (P1-dB) of (21.52 dBm, 23.17 dBm), the power gain of (27.29 dB, 28.74 dB) and the output referred intercept point (OIP3) of (19.41 dBm, 22.67 dBm), respectively.

From a cost perspective, it is often important to ensure the desired coverage ratio for the FoI within a maximum allowable response (MAR) time, by using a minimum number of sensors in MSNs. The literature on determining the minimum number of sensors for the desired coverage ratio assumes that the FoI is unbounded to overcome the border effects. Since the entire sensing sphere of the sensors near the boundary may not be useful for the coverage, the number of sensors estimated without the border effects is lower than the actual value. In this paper, we estimate the minimum number of sensors required to achieve a desired coverage ratio in a given MAR time for a 3D FoI. We term this problem ? V,T)-coverage problem, where ?, V, and T are the desired coverage ratio, average speed of sensors, and MAR time, respectively. We assume straight line mobility model for the sensors and consider the border effects while deriving the expected sensing volume of a sensor useful in coverage. We also consider the restriction of sampling rate of the sensors in this analysis. We discuss the application of our analysis for a non-hyper-rectangle shaped FoI, random walk, and waypoint mobility models, and also the impact of neglecting the border effects. Our numerical and simulation results demonstrate the significance of border effects on the number of sensors and also the relationship between the coverage ratio, MAR time, sampling period, and the sensing range. © 2017 IEEE.",3D wireless sensor networks; border effects; coverage; coverage; mobility model,Embedded systems; Low power electronics; 3d wireless sensor networks; Border effects; coverage; Low power embedded systems; Mobile sensor networks; Mobile wireless sensor network; Mobility model; Threedimensional (3-d); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15361233,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Localization system is required to provide position information to the nodes. Traditional localization method involves utilizing global positioning system (GPS) in all the nodes. It gives high precision, but is suitable only for outdoor environment. The energy consumption is also high. Recently, localization of each node was done using range-based and range-free techniques. Use of movable beacons to assist the nodes of a WSN in estimating their positions, has been proposed. A beacon is a node that is aware of its position (with GPS) and it will move in and around the sensor field. This beacon can be a robot. This paper gives an overview of the different localization techniques in WSN and an obstacle avoidance path planning localization algorithms, based on V Curve. This algorithm avoids the use of GPS in all sensor nodes except for the mobile beacon. And also in real-time environments, if a beacon is moving, it will be highly influenced by the obstacles. To avoid this obstacle, back-tracking technique is used. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Localization; Mobile anchor; Obstacle avoidance; Path planning; Wireless sensor network,Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global positioning system; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Localization; Localization algorithm; Localization method; Localization technique; Mobile anchors; Outdoor environment; Position information; Real-time environment; Wireless sensor networks,"Magadevi, N.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Anna UniversityIndia; email: magadevin5@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028587669

These sensor nodes sense the changes in physical parameters from the sensing range and forward the information to the sink nodes or the base station. Since sensor nodes are driven with limited power batteries, prolonging the network lifetime is difficult and very expensive, especially for hostile locations. Therefore, routing protocols for WSN must strategically distribute the dissipation of energy, so as to increase the overall lifetime of the system. Current research trends from areas, such as from Internet of Things and fog computing use sensors as the source of data. Therefore, energy-efficient data routing in WSN is still a challenging task for real-Time applications. Hierarchical grid-based routing is an energy-efficient method for routing of data packets. This method divides the sensing area into grids and is advantageous in wireless sensor networks to enhance network lifetime. The network is partitioned into virtual equal-sized grids. The proposed mode-switched grid-based routing protocol for WSN selects one node per grid as the grid head. The routing path to the sink is established using grid heads. Grid heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternately. Therefore, not all grid heads take part in the routing process at the same time. This saves energy in grid heads and improves the network lifetime. The proposed method builds a routing path using each active grid head which leads to the sink. For handling the mobile sink movement, the routing path changes only for some grid head nodes which are nearer to the grid, in which the mobile sink is currently positioned. Data packets generated at any source node are routed directly through the data disseminating grid head nodes on the routing path to the sink. © 2013 IEEE.",energy efficiency; grid head; grid-based routing; mobile sink; Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Grid Head; Grid-based routing; Hierarchical Grid; Internet of Things (IOT); Mobile sinks; Network lifetime; Physical parameters; Real-time application; Wireless sensor networks,"Puthal, D.; Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology SydneyAustralia; email: deepak.puthal@uts.edu.au",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028722885

In hierarchical structure of WSN, it is very difficult to deploy the sensor node in accurate position. In previous schemes, there are several methods which were proposed to achieve location accuracy. However, it suffered from excessive overhead during localization process. In this research work, an adaptive signal strength based localization approach (ASSLA) is proposed for increasing location accuracy with node update method. In this approach, the stable paths are found with the determination of bit error rate, signal strength and packet delivery ratio. Once the paths are found, a cluster is formed with minimal hop count value. Node location update value is estimated using revised vector concept and trilateration method. From the extensive simulation results and analysis using network simulation tool (NS 2.34), the proposed approach ASSLA outperforms than existing schemes in terms of delay, location accuracy, overhead, delivery ratio, location detection efficiency. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Cluster routing; Delivery ratio; Localization scheme; Node location update value; Overall delay and location detection efficiency of sensor nodes; Stable path determination; WSN,Bit error rate; Efficiency; Location; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster routing; Delivery ratio; Localization schemes; Location detection; Node location; Stable path determination; Sensor nodes,"Kiruthiga, G.; Karpagam UniversityIndia; email: kiruthiga_g532@rediffmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027530304

Underwater Smart things are deployed to facilitate the discovery of unexplored regions of ocean. Unique characteristics of underwater wireless sensor networks pose many constraints in transmission of data packets and energy efficient routing is one of them. Motivated by the significance of less costly energy efficient routing protocol, we propose energy efficient chain based routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks (E-CBCCP). While keeping in view the complex features of underwater dynamics, dynamic network topology and node mobility, energy of the cluster heads (CHs), relay nodes (RNs) and cluster coordinators (CCOs) has been considered during the transmission of data and role of the CHs, CCOs and RNs is changed after some time duration to maintain the load on the nodes. Distance based communication is based on the location aware nodes and can be used in monitoring domains during steady state but in dynamic state, location free communication is required therefore RN communication is based on hop to hop. Confidence level of the sensor nodes is computed to select the optimal RN and to improve the reliability. New prototype has shown the improvement over CARP a routing protocol in terms of data packets transmission and energy. Simulations in MATLAB validate our methodology which has decreased the communication cost of sensor nodes and hence prolonged the network lifetime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chain Based routing protocol; Energy efficient communication; Relay node election algorithm; UWSNs,Chains; Complex networks; Data transfer; Internet protocols; MATLAB; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Dynamic network topology; Election algorithms; Energy efficient communications; Energy efficient routing; Energy efficient routing protocol; Internet of underwater things; Underwater wireless sensor networks; UWSNs; Energy efficiency,"Rani, S.; Research Scholar, Department of Computer Applications, IKG Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: shalli@ssdwit.org",,Academic Press,10848045,,,,English,J Network Comput Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011031849

Node capture is one of the prominent attack in such networks. Whenever, a node is captured, its keys have to be revoked from the network by means of rekeying. We aim to optimize the problem of key revocation and rekeying by reducing the communication and computation overhead. An attack algorithm is presented from an adversarial view point, compromising of capturing cost and traveling cost. It is used to compute the destructive rank of each node which ultimately finds the set of vulnerable nodes of the network. Each communicating node determine a backup key for future node revocation and automatically switches to it, to avoid the reconfiguration of the shared key. The keys of vulnerable nodes are bypassed during the generation of the backup link keys. It is shown that proposed scheme has high level of security as well as reduced communication overhead during rekeying process. The proposed attack is also compared with random attack and found that it is improved in terms of route compromise ratio and energy cost. © 2017 IEEE.",Node capture attack; Node revocation; Random key predistribution; Rekeying,Cost reduction; Costs; Wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Computation overheads; Key revocation; Node capture attack; Node revocation; Random key distribution; Random key predistribution; Re-keying; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Due to the wide variety of WSN applications, there is a need for protocol solutions optimized for specific application classes. JRAM is proposed for WSNs deployed for monitoring multiple events in the same geographic region which require prompt detection and response. In existing contention-based synchronous MAC protocols designed for this, a node gets only one chance to succeed in data transmission scheduling per cycle, and a sink can also only receive data packets from at most one node in a cycle. Therefore, end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD) and packet delivery ratio (PDR) of these protocols drastically degrade with the increase in event occurrence rate (EOR). In contrast, JRAM proposes a novel approach to provide {k (k >1) chances to a node to succeed in data transmission scheduling in a cycle, and also allows a sink to receive data packets from k nodes in the same cycle. This is done, in JRAM, by partitioning the network nodes into k disjoint sets and then using a novel cycle structure. We evaluate JRAM through extensive NS-2.35 simulations and compare its performance with existing pipelined data collection (PDC), adaptive data collection (ADC), and CROPMAC protocols, for different types of traffic loads and traffic patterns. Results suggest that in case of high EOR, JRAM outperforms PDC, ADC and CROPMAC both in terms of the E2ETD and the PDR. © 2014 IEEE.",Energy-efficiency; medium access control (MAC) protocols; routing protocols; transmission delay; wireless sensor networks (WSNs),Access control; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Network routing; Oil well flooding; Routing protocols; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Data transmission scheduling; End-to-end transmission; Many-to-one communications; Medium access control protocols; Packet delivery ratio; Transmission delays; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wsn applications; Wireless sensor networks,"Singh, R.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: s.ripudaman@iitg.ernet.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23274662,,,,English,IEEE Internet Things J.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023196570

Development of energy efficient data collection protocols became the major concern in WSN. Clustering is one of the suitable techniques for energy efficiency. However, in clustering, the cluster are formed with uneven size. This unbalances the energy consumption among clusters which in turn reduce the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in order to balance the energy among clusters, a multi-hop concept is introduced for both intra and inter cluster communication. Firstly, the RFDMRP: River Formation Dynamics based Multi-hop Routing Protocol has been proposed. Later, this protocol is integrated with clustering and a new hybrid technique, named as hybrid clustering communication algorithm using RFDMRP (HCCRFD) is introduced. HCCRFD improves energy conservation by reducing overall packet transmission distance of intra and inter cluster communication, which results in increased network lifetime. Energy consumption of proposed algorithm has been analyzed mathematically. Also, the algorithms were simulated using MATLAB and outputs observed. The observed outputs were compared with existing protocols such as LEACH, DEEC, ERA, and ACH2 in three different scenarios namely homogenous, heterogeneous environment, and node density. The comparison reveals that the proposed algorithm perform better than the existing protocols with respect to energy conservation and network lifetime. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cluster; Data collection; Multi-hop routing; Network lifetime; River formation dynamics; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks,Data acquisition; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Data collection; Formation dynamics; Multi-hop routing; Network lifetime; Clustering algorithms,"Guravaiah, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kguravaiah@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011568175

Realization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is possible by configuring IEEE 802.15.4 in peer-to-peer topology as it fits the requirements of WSNs. Underlying protocols should take care of energy consumption as most of the nodes are battery operated and inaccessible after deployment. Focus should also be given to delay introduced due to channel sensing. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance in IEEE 802.15.4 ensures reduced probability of collision with the use of sporadic backoff delay before channel assessment. Channel assessment is performed by either one Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) or two consecutive CCAs. In this paper efforts have been made to reduce energy consumption and to reduce average delay by reducing the number of backoff periods taken before channel sensing. Method mentioned in this paper also reduces the number of backoffs as well as channel access failures. Proposed method also reduces the number of collisions. To achieve these goals, proposed method takes two, three or four consecutive CCAs to decide upon current channel status.

As energy becomes a quite challenging issue in these networks, clustering protocols are employed to deal with this problem. One of the main research areas in cluster-based routing protocols is fair distribution and balancing the overall energy consumption in the WSN, by selecting the most suitable cluster heads (CHs). In order to reduce the energy consumption and enhancing the CHs selection process a new routing protocol based on fuzzy logic has been proposed. There exist several algorithms based of fuzzy logic to select the most proper CHs for the network. But these algorithms do not consider all the important parameters and information of the sensor nodes in order to guarantee the optimal selection of the CHs. In The proposed algorithm, a two-step fuzzy logic system is used to select the appropriate CHs. The selection of CHs is based on six descriptors; residual energy, density, distance to base station, vulnerability index, centrality and distance between CHs. The result of the simulation indicates that, the proposed algorithm performs better comparing with some other similar approaches in case of fair distribution and balancing of the overall energy consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cluster heads selection; Clustering protocols; Energy; Fuzzy logic; WSNs,Algorithms; Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Reconfigurable hardware; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster head; Clustering protocol; Energy; Resource restrictions; Vulnerability index; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Fuzzy logic,"Tamandani, Y.K.; Department of Computer Science, Aligarh Muslim UniversityIndia; email: Yahya.kord@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964008632

In WSNs, geographic adaptive fidelity (GAF) is one of the most energy efficient location based protocol which extends the network lifetime by identifying equivalence between sensors using geographic location information and then keeping unnecessary sensors in sleep state, while maintaining application fidelity. Still traditional GAF cannot reach to the optimum energy usage since it needs more hop count to transmit data packets to the base station called sink. As a result, it leads to higher energy usage and packet delay due to participation of more sensors. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based topology management protocol named FTGAF-HEX, which bases on GAF is proposed to achieve minimum packet delay with higher energy conservation. Furthermore, we propose to use a generalized version of GAF based on honeycomb virtual grid architecture called Hexagonal GAF (GAF-HEX) to replace the square grid with hexagonal one. Analysis and simulation results show significant improvement of the proposed work compared to traditional GAF in the aspect of various performance metrics i.e., total hop count, energy consumption and distance covered by the data packet before reaching the sink. As a result, compared to traditional GAF-HEX, it needs 3744% less hop count and consumes 1724% less energy to prolong the network lifetime. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Internet protocols; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Geographic adaptive fidelities; Geographic location; Geographic routing protocols; Location-based protocols; Performance metrics; Topology management; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Power management (telecommunication),"Soni, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology MesraIndia; email: vaibsoni@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,9467076,,,,English,Microsyst Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010723247

In MWSN, nodes move in and out of the network randomly. Hence, a path formed between two distant nodes is highly susceptible to changes due to unpredictable node movement. Also, due to the limited resources in WSN, the paths used for data transmission must be tested for the link quality and time consumed for data forwarding. In order to solve these issues, in this paper, an ant-based routing protocol with QoS-effective data collection mechanism is proposed. In this protocol, the link quality and link delay are estimated for each pair of nodes. Link quality is estimated in terms of packet reception rate, received signal strength indicator, and link quality index. A reliable path is chosen from the source to the destination based on the paths traversed by forward ants and backward ants. Then, if the link is found to be defective during data transmission, a link reinforcement technique is used to deliver the data packet at the destination successfully. The mobile robots collect the information with high data utility. In addition, each mobile robot is equipped with multiple antennas, and space division multiple access technique is then applied for effective data collection from multiple mobile robots.

These restrictions make the sensor network prone to failures because most of the energy is spent on data transmission, sensing, and computing. Many applications such as habitat monitoring, military surveillance and forest fire detection expect the sensor nodes to last for a long time because they operate human unattended. Therefore, the major challenges in designing a wireless sensor network (WSN) are energy conservation, reducing data transmission delay and improving the network lifetime. In this context, data aggregation is an intelligent technique used in WSN, wherein the data from disparate sources are accumulated at intermediate nodes, thereby reducing the number of packets to be sent to the sink. Literature study shows that various routing algorithms are used to perform data aggregation based on the network topology. In order to provide an improved performance amongst the existing, a routing algorithm called cluster-chain mobile agent routing (CCMAR) is proposed in this work. It makes full use of the advantages of both low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (PEGASIS). CCMAR divides the WSN into a few clusters and runs in two phases.The proposed system is simulated and evaluated for the performance metrics such as energy consumption, transmission delay and network lifetime.

In WSNs, energy management and network lifetime optimization are major issues in the designing of routing protocols. Clustering is an efficient data gathering technique that effectively reduces the energy consumption by organizing nodes into groups. However, in clustering protocols, cluster heads (CHs) bear additional load for coordinating various activities within the cluster. Improper selection of CHs causes increased energy consumption and also degrades the performance of WSN. Therefore, proper CH selection and their load balancing using efficient routing protocol is a critical aspect for the long run operation of WSN. Clustering a network with proper load balancing is an NP-hard problem. To solve such problems having vast search area, optimization algorithm is the preeminent possible solution. In this paper, differential evolution based clustering algorithm for WSNs named threshold-sensitive energy-efficient delay-aware routing protocol (TEDRP), is proposed to prolong network lifetime. Dual-hop communication between CHs and BS is utilized to achieve load balancing of distant CHs and energy minimization. The paper also considers stability-aware model of TEDRP named stable TEDRP (STEDRP) with an intend to extend the stability period of the network. In STEDRP, energy aware heuristics is applied for CH selection in order to improve the stability period. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocols significantly outperform existing protocols in terms of energy consumption, system lifetime and stability period. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Boolean DE; DE; Network lifetime; Stability period; WSN,Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet protocols; Network routing; Optimization; Power management; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Boolean DE; Clustering protocol; Differential Evolution; Distributed nodes; Energy minimization; Network lifetime; Optimization algorithms; Stable clustering; Power management (telecommunication),"Mittal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh UniversityIndia; email: mittal.nitin84@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010735716

Based on the application scenario, the reliability of the nodes deployed has become more important for trust management evaluation. At the same time, trust management system should not be power killing, complex in terms of computation and processing capability. To convey a noticeable framework, we propose Collaborative Trust based Secure Routing protocol (CTSR) for observing direct and indirect trust values. Here we utilize two-way acknowledgement-based trust framework (2-ACKT) which requires lesser memory resources and minimizes the communication overhead. Our simulation setup for Mobile Adhoc Networks with 2-ACKT framework calculates trust value with both direct and indirect observations based on Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of uncertain reasoning approach respectively. Since the inception of DST for indirect observation in wireless networks trust values are effectively derived with data packets and control packets. The capability of DST to solve the problems with different reliability has flaws in certain areas where the nodes were subjected to disclose critical information like residual energy level and available bandwidth. And also common results derived from DST may lead to uncertain decisions. Considering all these factors we make few notable modifications in DST to enhance the security feature in 2-ACT. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2-ACKT; Dempster-Shafer theory; Mobile Ad-hoc networks; Throughput,Ad hoc networks; Bandwidth; Bayesian networks; Computation theory; Formal logic; Inference engines; Military applications; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Probabilistic logics; Sensor nodes; Throughput; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; 2-ACKT; Communication overheads; Dempster-Shafer theory; Design and Development; Indirect trust values; Trust management systems; Trust-based Secure Routing; Wireless communications; Mobile ad hoc networks,"Sargunavathi, S.; St Josephs College of Engineering, Sholinganallur, India; email: rndsargunavathi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,1383469X,,,,English,Mobile Networks Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015618888

Initially, the proposed work forms various clusters within the network and thereafter, the coalitions are formed using the proposed algorithm based on the game theory. The proposed algorithm considers the extent of spatially correlated sensed data that are generated by neighbouring nodes in order to form a coalition within a cluster. The proposed coalition scheme reduces the number of transmissions across the network. It is compared with the competing clustering protocols. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves the increased network lifetime under the specified quality of service specification (QSS). The results of the proposed work are compared with that obtained through the existing low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and the deterministic stable election protocols (D-SEP). The overall improvement gain achieved by the proposed work is 31% and 10% at specified QSS, when compared with the LEACH and the D-SEP protocols respectively.

Information gathering is a typical but an important operation in many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It is necessary to operate the sensor network for longer period of time in an energy efficient manner for gathering information. One of the popular WSN protocol, named low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and its variants, aim to prolong the network lifetime using energy efficient clustering approach. These protocols increase the network lifetime at the expense of reduced stability period (the time span before the first node dies). The reduction in stability period is because of the high energy variance of nodes. Stability period is an essential aspect to preserve coverage properties of the network. Higher is the stability period, more reliable is the network. Higher energy variance of nodes leads to load unbalancing among nodes and therefore lowers the stability period. Hence, it is perpetually attractive to design clustering algorithms that provides higher stability, lower energy variance and are energy efficient. In this paper to overcome the shortcomings of existing clustering protocols, a protocol named stable energy efficient clustering protocol is proposed. It balances the load among nodes using energy-aware heuristics and hence ensures higher stability period. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms LEACH and its variants in terms of energy variance and stability period. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Clustering; DRESEP; Network lifetime; Residual energy; SEECP; WSNs,Clustering algorithms; Leaching; Low power electronics; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; DRESEP; Network lifetime; Residual energy; SEECP; WSNs; Energy efficiency,"Mittal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh UniversityIndia; email: mittal.nitin84@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961588974

This analysis put forward two different algorithms; mixed hierarchical cluster oriented routing program and hybrid hierarchical secure algorithm. A mixed hierarchal cluster based algorithm has been suggested for generating CNH and CN, for identifying the harmful node and packet is securely delivered. The source node transmits details about packet to the CN and then it chooses the pathway which is the shortest, depending upon the trust value among intermediate node and sensor node. The behavior activities of all the nodes are analyzed by the CNH, if anyone of the nodes behavior found to be incorrect, the organizer who finds the harmful node and CNH will drop those particular node behaviors.

Outlier is referred to as deviated behavior from normal pattern of the network elements caused by noise, events or attacks. Outlier detection is crucial for normal functioning of the network and forms the first step towards security management. By taking suitable actions or by thwarting the erroneous behavior outliers can be managed. Events occur when there is a change in the state of the networks and is expected behavior in the network, whereas attacks are unexpected behavior in network causing difficult situation in the network. Event detection and attack detection are many a times mistook as same.

Hence, resource mapping is required in a WMSN, which is based on user linguistic quality of service (QoS) requirements and available resources to offer better communication services. This paper proposes an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based resource mapping for video communications in WMSNs. Each sensor node is equipped with ANFIS, which employs three inputs (user QoS request, available node energy, and available node bandwidth) to predict the quality of the video output in terms of varying number of frames/second with either fixed or varying resolution. The sensor nodes periodically measure the available node energy and also the bandwidth. The spatial query processing in the proposed resource mapping works as follows. (i) The sink node receives the user query for some event. (ii) The sink node sends the query through an intermediate sensor node(s) and cluster head(s) in the path to an event node. A cluster head-based tree routing algorithm is used for routing. (iii) The query passes through ANFIS of intermediate sensor nodes and cluster heads, where each node predicts the quality of the video output. (iv) The event node chooses the minimum quality among all cluster heads and intermediate nodes in the path and transmits the video output. The work is simulated in different network scenarios to test the performance in terms of predicted frames/second and frame format. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed resource mapping is the first work in the area of sensor networks. The trained ANFIS predicts the output video quality in terms of number of frames/second (or H.264 video format) accurately for the given input. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",ANFIS; fuzzy inference system; query processing; resource management; resource mapping; Wireless multimedia sensor networks,Bandwidth; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Mapping; Multimedia systems; Quality of service; Query languages; Query processing; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; ANFIS; Fuzzy inference systems; Resource management; Resource mapping; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Sensor nodes,"Shivappa, N.; JSS Academy of Technical Education, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Uttarahalli-kengeri Main Road, India; email: nageshashiva@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023161893

They are suited for operation in coarse radio environments and in isolated locations. In Zigbee based wireless networks, various routing protocols such as reactive routing protocols and Zigbee Tree Routing (ZTR) protocol were initially proposed. Among them, ZTR is widely used, since it neither makes use of routing table nor requires route discovery overhead and it can be used among devices that are limited in their resources. But it suffers from a serious limitation, (i.e) in ZTR the packets are routed through fundamental tree topology. Therefore, ZTR do not provide optimal routing paths. In order to surpass the limitation of ZTR, Shortcut Tree Routing (STR) protocols were proposed. These protocols find the optimal next hop node that has the smallest remaining hop counts to the destination. Hence, this paper presents a survey on various STR protocols and also compares the performance of network using STR under two cases. The first case is the one in which the nodes are static and the second is the one in which the nodes are mobile. The simulations are done using ns2 and the performance of STR is evaluated and analyzed using metrics such as average residual energy and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). © 2016 IEEE.",Average residual energy; PDR; Routing protocols; STR; Zigbee based wireless networks,Internet protocols; Remote control; Routing protocols; Surveys; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Average residual energy; Optimal routing; Packet delivery ratio; Radio environment; Reactive routing protocol; Route discovery; Sensor applications; Wireless networking standard; Network routing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

IMPR protocol proactively identifies trajectories based on convergent locations. Convergent location is the predominant geographical area where the sink receives the highest response from the sensor nodes.

The main challenge of WSN is the distance, energy and time delay. The power resource of the sensor node is a non-rechargeable battery. Here the greater the distance between the nodes, higher the energy consumption. For having the effective transmission of data with less energy, the cluster-head approach is used. It is well known that the time delay is directly proportional to the distance between the nodes and the base station. The cluster head is selected in such a way that it is spatially closer enough to the base station as well as the sensor nodes. So, the time delay can be substantially reduced. This, in turn, the transmission speed of the data packets can be increased. Firefly algorithm is developed for maximizing the energy efficiency of network and lifetime of nodes by selecting the cluster head optimally. In this paper firefly with cyclic randomization is proposed for selecting the best cluster head. The network performance is increased in this method when compared to the other conventional algorithms. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Cluster head; Firefly with cyclic randomization (FCR); Wireless sensor network,Base stations; Bioluminescence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimization; Random processes; Sensor nodes; Time delay; Cluster head; Cluster-head selections; Conventional algorithms; Effective transmission; Energy efficient; Firefly algorithms; Firefly with cyclic randomization (FCR); Transmission speed; Wireless sensor networks,"Sarkar, A.; Vel Tech Dr RR & Dr SR Technical UniversityIndia; email: sarkar.amit2k@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023781814

Area coverage is one of the issues in WSN that guarantees the selected active nodes among all the deployed nodes should cover each point of the deployed area. The objective of complete area coverage is to find out redundant nodes and deactivate them, so that the remaining active nodes can cover the deployed area. Among the various existing approaches for area coverage in WSN, a grid-based approach has been proposed that provides a better way to select the active nodes or deactivate the redundant nodes from the grid rather than choosing the nodes from the deployed area. The existing approach goes with certain limitations such as how many numbers of grids need to be made in a certain deployed area with a certain number of nodes and how much percentage of nodes need to be selected from each grid. In order to avoid these limitations, in this paper, we propose a randomized grid-based approach that splits the intended area into small grids depending upon the density of nodes in a different location of the deployed area. At the same time, rather than selecting a certain percentage of nodes from each grid, here we select only one node from each grid and repeat the process till selected nodes satisfy the whole area coverage. Matlab simulator is used to study the simulation results of the proposed work, and it is found that the proposed randomized grid-based approach outperforms the existing grid-based approach both with respect to energy as well as throughput. © 2017 IEEE.",Area coverage; Voronoi; Wireless Sensor Network,MATLAB; Wireless sensor networks; Active node; Area coverages; Grid-based approach; Intermediate node; Matlab simulators; Redundant nodes; Voronoi; Sensor nodes,,PadmaSai Y.Garg D.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The localization algorithms or techniques can be categorized into two: range-based and range-free. The range-free scheme uses the connectivity information between nodes. In the range-free scheme, nodes that are aware of their location are called anchors, while others that are not are called normal nodes. Anchors are fixed nodes, while the normal nodes are generally mobile. For estimation of their positions, the normal nodes initially gather the information of the positions of anchors as well as their connection, and then calculates its own positions. When compared with range-based techniques, the range-free techniques are more cost-effective, since no additional devices are required. As a result, this paper focuses on the study of two range-free localisation techniques namely, Approximate Point in Triangulation (APIT) and DV-Hop. Thus, we are interested in the investigation of wireless sensor networks on application of these two techniques under varying conditions and parameters. © 2017 IEEE.",APIT; DV-Hop; Localisation; WSN,Cost effectiveness; Sensor nodes; Surveying; Triangulation; APIT; Comparative analysis; Connectivity information; DV-Hop; Environmental Monitoring; Localisation; Localization algorithm; Localization problems; Wireless sensor networks,,PadmaSai Y.Garg D.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

In WSNs, the network is partitioned into several numbers of clusters of same or different size. In each cluster, a cluster head is selected. Some cluster heads are located nearer to the sink node and some are far away from the sink node. The cluster head distance from the sink node may probably influence the quality of data transmission and consume energy in high rate, which causes earlier death of cluster head. To reduce this problem, an informed search algorithm ModLeach-A is proposed. The algorithm can evade prior death of several cluster head nodes and modify the energy utilization load from cluster-head nodes to the entire sensor network i.e. to extend the life time of the networks and improve the quality of data transmission. © 2016 IEEE.",cost function; ModLeach-A Shortest Path; WSNs,Clustering algorithms; Cost effectiveness; Cost functions; Costs; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy utilization; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Systems analysis; Cluster-head nodes; Informed search; Quality of data; Search Algorithms; Shortest path; Shortest path routing; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

These sensor nodes used to deploy in the hostile or unattended areas to sense and monitor the atmospheric situations such as motion, pressure, sound, temperature and vibration etc. The sensor nodes have low energy and low computing power, any security scheme for wireless sensor network must not be computationally complex and it should be efficient. In this paper we introduced a secure routing protocol for WSNs, which is able to prevent the network from DDoS attack. In our methodology we scan the infected nodes using the proposed algorithm and block that node from any further activities in the network. To protect the network we use intrusion prevention scheme, where specific nodes of the network acts as IPS node. These nodes operate in their radio range for the region of the network and scan the neighbors regularly. When the IPS node find a misbehavior node which is involves in frequent message passing other than UDP and TCP messages, IPS node blocks the infected node and also send the information to all genuine sender nodes to change their routes. All simulation work has been done using NS 2.35. After simulation the proposed scheme gives feasible results to protect the network against DDoS attack. The performance parameters have been improved after applying the security mechanism on an infected network. © 2017 IEEE.",DDoS attack; intrusion; IPS; security Algorithm; sink node; WSNs,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Denial-of-service attack; Low power electronics; Mercury (metal); Message passing; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Uninterruptible power systems; Wireless sensor networks; DDoS Attack; intrusion; Security algorithm; Sink nodes; WSNs; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

To maintain inter-actor connectivity is crucial in real time situations where actors have to quickly take corrective actions to detected events. Failure of actor and sensors partitions the inter-actor network into disjoint segments, and thus disrupt the network connectivity. Various approaches have been proposed to restore the connectivity of the network. This paper proposes the node failure recovery scheme known as hybrid connectivity restoration approach that works in a distributed manner for detecting partitions in a network and restore the connectivity. This approach may involve relocation of multiple sensors and actor nodes on the path and also analyze the energy consumption of each node before selecting them as a backup node. Thus, reducing the message overhead, less data backup energy consumption, and improves network connectivity. The effectiveness of this hybridization is validated through various simulation experiments. © 2016 IEEE.",connectivity restoration; Records-Node failure; Remains Energy; shortest path; Topology change,Energy utilization; Interactive computer systems; Restoration; Wireless sensor networks; Connectivity restorations; Node failure; Remains Energy; Shortest path; Topology changes; Real time systems,"Kaur, H.; SCSE, SMVD UniversityIndia; email: harinder211@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"India Int.

The current state of art in detecting immediate and long term railway track problems involves both inspectors walking the track lines and train cars instrumented with accelerometers and ultrasonic sensors that are capable of detecting wear of the rail and breakages. But still, accidents do occur. Track maintenance is the primary concern for railways to prevent accidents. Human inspections of the track are subjective and consume a lot of time, labour and power whereas train cars instrumented with sensors will provide the local analysis of the inspected track and are prone to missed failures and false alarms. Condition monitoring using Wireless Sensor Network can provide the integrated view of the entire railway asset and thus can reduce human inspection requirements through automated monitoring. This approach can reduce maintenance time by detecting faults before they escalate and thus, provides a more safe and reliable system. However, to build an efficient railway track fault detection technique using Wireless Sensor Network is a challenging task as sensors are power and memory constrained devices. Therefore, this paper presents the survey on cluster based routing techniques that can be used to reduce communication cost, data aggregation techniques to reduce data redundancy and help to transmit useful information and fault detection techniques to identify the faulty nodes in the network. We have also presented the analysis of these surveyed algorithms based on their approach and parameters like energy consumption and network lifetime which can be used to build an efficient track fault detection algorithm that can provide the track fault location in real time and alert the system with less energy consumption. © 2017 IEEE.",Cluster based data aggregation; Cluster based fault detection; Cluster based routing; Condition monitoring; Metro railways; Railway track fault; Wireless Sensor Network (WSN),Accidents; Condition monitoring; Data reduction; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Inspection; Network routing; Partial discharges; Railroad accidents; Railroad tracks; Railroads; Rails; Routers; Surveys; Transportation; Ubiquitous computing; Ultrasonic applications; Urban transportation; Cluster-based; Cluster-based routing; Data aggregation; Metro railways; Railway track; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Energy consumption is the major problem of WSN to overcome this problem there are many solutions introduced, it consists flat, hierarchical and location based routing. The basic hierarchical routing protocol for WSN is Low Energy Adaptive clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). LEACH works in two different phases viz. set-up and steady-state phase.

For load balancing and efficient data collection in the network, clustering is used. Sensors in each cluster send the data to their corresponding cluster heads. The cluster head performs data aggregation and transmission of the aggregated data to the base station. Farther sensor nodes data are aggregated by cluster heads and send to the base station. This leads to a heavy traffic and faster depletion of energy to the nodes that are nearer to the sink. To enhance the energy conservation, for suppressing hot spot problem and for load balance achievement, we propose an algorithm namely as ECUCF (Energy Conserved Unequal Clusters with Fuzzy logic). Based on the distances of the nodes from the base station, the network is divided into three different sectors. For designing unequal clusters in each sector, a fuzzy logic approach is followed. The cluster heads that are nearer to the base station are designed to be of smaller sizes whereas the cluster heads that are situated farther away from the sink to have higher cluster sizes. The proposed algorithm ECUCF is simulated using MATLAB environment. The performances obtained are compared with the performances of other clustering schemes like LEACH (equal clustering algorithm) and FBUC (unequal clustering algorithm). From the simulated results, it is found that the performances of ECUCF are much improved as compared to LEACH and FBUC in maximizing the number of clusters, increasing the number of live nodes in the network and extending the lifetime of nodes on each round of operation. © 2017 IEEE.",Cluster; Competition radius; Fuzzy logic; Prime-CH; Residual energy; Unequal clustering,Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Leaching; MATLAB; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Fuzzy logic approach; MATLAB environment; Number of clusters; Prime-CH; Research challenges; Residual energy; Unequal clustering; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

While making an alert or call, the global position using the latitude and longitudinal coordinates of the user will also be sent to the service provider. All the information about the service provider will be stored pre-definably in the application and it can also be updated or new contacts can be added if required. In this application, we did not use any tool for translating the text into our Tamil language. We are using the BAMINI as a font and is imported for the user interface of the application. The main drawback is to overcome the language complexity. It is in our Tamil language which makes it to be used even by people who doesn't know any foreign language hence making it more user-friendly. © 2017 IEEE.",Android; Bluetooth sensors; Emergency Reporting; GPS; Wireless sensor networks,Global positioning system; User interfaces; Wireless sensor networks; Android; Bluetooth sensors; Emergency Reporting; Emergency situation; Foreign language; High frequency HF; Language complexity; Service provider; Emergency services,,Ramesh P.L.N.Moorthi M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Human beings cannot totally avoid floods but the only thing humans can do is, they can develop suitable systems to predict & subsequent measures to alert the people about its occurrence. There are many technologies available to predict and prevent. There are many natural disasters that lead to floods. Some of them are heavy rains and tropical cyclones. These floods cause materialistic and human damage. The main reason behind development of flood alert system is the intimation of flood well in advance so that human losses can be controlled by evacuation of people to safe places and also protects valuable properties. Despite certain damage occurs due to the drawbacks of the system. This paper explores flood warning systems and issues associated with each of them.

Media portrayal of drowning as a loud, violent struggle have much more in common with distressed unskilled swimmers, Drowning causes the third highest number of unintentional death. Many drowning prevention systems have been proposed however they are not suitable for implementation at sea level. Our target to abide a cryptogram lapse prevents drowning at the beaches. Two sensors namely oxygen sensor and water detector are used. Water detectors are placed in the locket. This is suitable for people who play at the shore; who don't go deep into beaches. If a person gets pulled into the sea by the waves, the water detector in their locket will be submerged completely and if the detector continues to remain submerged then an alarm is triggered through which the coast guards are alerted. Oxygen sensor used for swimmers and is placed in the armbands of the swimmer. Oxygen level in the sea and the oxygen level in the atmosphere vary drastically. If a swimmer is about to drown the oxygen level will constantly be around 80 per cent (which is the normal oxygen residue in the sea); Then the sensor triggers a floating aide and simultaneously alerts the coast guards. An underwater network is deployed with a modem at each network node. The sensors communicate with these nodes. Similarly, sensors are placed on the seabed to indicate sudden increase in depth. When a user is about to cross those sensors the controller alerts the coastguards and the swimmer. © 2017 IEEE.",Drowning; Oxygen sensor; Water detector; Wireless sensor networks,Accidents; Beaches; Locks (fasteners); Oxygen; Oxygen sensors; Sea level; Sensor nodes; Coastguards; Drowning; Network node; Oxygen levels; Prevention systems; Underwater networks; Unintentional deaths; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Due to congestion in the network, the throughput of the network is affected, which imposes the need for congestion control in the network. This article proposes a method, titled NARX Neural network-based Rate Adjustment (NNRA) for avoiding and controlling congestion in the network. Initially, congestion in the network is avoided by dropping packets and the NNRA is used to control congestion in the network when congestion is present. Performance analysis is carried out in terms of throughput, delay, size of the queue, packet loss, and the level of the congestion using two setups. The results of the proposed method are compared with the existing methods to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The proposed protocol works in two phases, the advertisement (ADV) phase and data phase, which run concurrently. During the ADV phase, the nodes having data try to contend the advertisement channel to transmit the ADV packet. The nodes after receiving the acknowledgment from the receiver switch to the available free channel for the communication of the data packet.

People uses wireless technology along with sensor for monitoring home held devices, security alerts, natural disasters alert, building supervision, industrial quality management, etc. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of thousands of economical and feasible disposable sensors, deployed in the environment to sense parameters related to the surroundings such as temperature, moisture level, pressure etc., Number of sensor nodes are connected in these networks for communication. Each nodes are self-organized, having the capacity of sense, process, and aggregate data. Energy utilization in WSN is major issue in networks for improving network lifetime. Conventional clustering schemes are created with static cluster heads that die past than the normal nodes that degrade the network performance in routing. It is very vital area to develop an energy aware clustering protocol in WSN to reduce energy consumption for increasing network life time. In this paper, a Energy Aware Clustering using Neuro-fuzzy approach (EACNF) is proposed to form finest and energy aware clusters. The proposed scheme consists of fuzzy subsystem and neural network system that achieved energy efficiency in forming clusters and cluster heads in WSN. EACNF used neural network that provide effective training set related to energy and density of all nodes to estimate the expected energy for Uncertain cluster heads. Sensor nodes with higher energy are trained with various location of base station to select energy aware cluster heads. Fuzzy ifthen mapping rule is used in fuzzy logic part that inputs to form clusters and cluster heads. EACNF is designed for WSN that handling Trust factor for security to the network. EACNF used three metric such as transmission range, residual energy and Trust factor for improving network life time. The proposed scheme EACNF is compared with related clustering schemes namely Cluster-Head Election Mechanism using Fuzzy Logic and Energy-Aware Fuzzy Unequal Clustering.

The maximum possible number is determined by the most sparsely covered region, called critical region. To identify the critical region, the monitored area is divided into fields. This paper presents a novel two stage grid classification based algorithm to identify fields in a WSN monitored area divided into grids with a sensor membership vector (SMV) created for each grid. The grids having equal length of the SMV are clubbed to form groups. Within a group, the grids having identical SMV are further aggregated to form fields. The execution time of the proposed algorithm is improved by comparing the SMV of a grid with those of the other grids in its respective group only instead of all the grids in the monitored area. As long as the number of grids remains unchanged, the execution time is also less sensitive to change in the number and sensing ranges of the deployed sensors because the SMVs of the grids are compared instead of the grids covered by each sensor. The results of the algorithm are validated by comparing its performance with the conventional algorithms. The effect of variation in the number and sensing ranges of the deployed sensors on the fields formed, the sensors covering the critical field and the lifetime of the WSN have also been analyzed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Coverage; Disjoint sets; Fields; Scheduling; Wireless sensor networks; WSN lifetime,Scheduling; Complete coverages; Conventional algorithms; Coverage; Critical fields; Disjoint sets; Fields; Number of Grids; WSN lifetime; Wireless sensor networks,"Panag, T.S.; Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engineering CollegeIndia; email: panagtripat@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991358627

Since the estimation of collective coverage-area turns out to be computationally complex in the euclidean geometry, we represent each Euclidean circle in ?2 with a digital circle in ?2 for enabling faster computation. Based on the underlying geometric properties of digital circles, we present a novel O(n log n) centralized algorithm and O(d2log d) distributed algorithm for coverage estimation, where d denotes the maximum degree of a node. In order to further expedite the estimation procedure, we approximate each digital circle by the tightest square that encloses it as well as by the largest square inscribed within it. Such approximation allows us to estimate the coverage-area, in a much simpler way, based on the intersection-geometry of a set of axis-parallel rectangles. Our experiments with random deployment of nodes demonstrate that the proposed algorithms estimate the area coverage with a maximum error of only 1.5 percent, while reducing the computational effort significantly compared to earlier work. The technique needs only simple data structures and requires a few primitive integer operations in contrast to classical methods, which need extensive floating-point computations for exact estimation. Furthermore, for an over-deployed network, the estimation provides an almost-exact measure of the covered area. © 2017 IEEE.",Coverage estimation; digital geometry; wireless sensor networks,D region; Digital arithmetic; Geometry; Image resolution; Sensor nodes; Axis parallel rectangles; Centralized algorithms; Computational effort; Coverage estimations; Digital geometry; Estimation procedures; Floating-point computation; Geometric properties; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23327766,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

A sensor is battery-operated, unattended low-cost device with limited computing, communication and storage capabilities. Thus the network lifetime has become the key characteristic for evaluating sensor networks in an application-specific way. There are certain approaches in literature which consider the lifetime maximization problem. However, they suffer from impulsive energy hole, coverage hole and communication hole. In this paper we propose a novel Energy Efficient Connected Coverage (EECC) scheduling to maximize the lifetime of the WSN. The EECC adheres to Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as remaining energy, coverage and connectivity. In EECC the sensor which doesn't contribute to coverage will act as a relay node to reduce the burden of the sensing node. The sensing node senses the target whereas the relaying node communicates the sensory information to the sink. The EECC forms non-disjoint cover sets using remaining energy, coverage and connectivity of every sensor. The proposed EECC outperforms similar scheduling algorithms found in the literature in an energy efficient way with the short execution time. Through simulations the constancy of EECC in extending the lifetime of WSN is confirmed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient connected coverage (EECC); Lifetime maximization; Remaining energy; Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),Energy efficiency; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Lifetime maximization; Remaining energies; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Roselin, J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Regional Office, Anna University Tirunelveli RegionIndia; email: roselin.js@auttvl.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,15708705,,,,English,Ad Hoc Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019650892

Starting from the sink node (e.g., a base station), a ""deployment agent"" walks along the line, stops at equally spaced points (""potential"" relay locations), placing relays at some of these points, until he reaches a location at which the source node (i.e., the sensor) needs to be placed, the objective being to create a multihop wireless relay network between the source and the sink. The deployment agent decides whether to place a relay or not at each of the potential locations, depending upon the link quality measurements to the previously placed relays. In this article, we seek to design efficient deployment algorithms for this class of problems, to achieve the objective of 2-connectivity in the deployed network.We ensure multi-connectivity by allowing each node to communicate with more than one neighbouring node. By proposing a network cost objective that is additive over the deployed relays, we formulate the relay placement problem as a Markov decision process.

However, designing a secure and reliable authentication scheme for WSNs that can be deployed in IoT remains a research and operational challenge. For example, recently in 2016, Amin and Biswas showed that the Turcanovi? et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to smart card loss attack, user impersonation attack, etc. They then proposed a new authentication scheme for WSNs with multi-gateway. In this paper, we revisit the scheme of Amin and Biswas and reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities in the scheme (i.e. sensor capture attack, user forgery attack, gateway forgery attack, sensor forgery attack and off-line guessing attack). In addition, we demonstrate that the user in the scheme can be tracked due to the use of a constant pseudo-identity and previously established session keys can be calculated by the attacker. Rather than attempting to fix a broken scheme, we present a novel authentication scheme for multi-gateway based WSNs. We then demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme using Proverif, as well as evaluating the good performance of the scheme using NS-2 simulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Multi-gateway; Sensor capture attack; Smart card; User anonymity; Wireless sensor network,Authentication; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Network security; Smart cards; Transportation; Authentication scheme; Efficient authentication; Internet of Things (IOT); Operational challenges; Pseudo identities; User anonymity; User impersonation attacks; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Li, X.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: lixiongzhq@163.com",,Academic Press,10848045,,,,English,J Network Comput Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009936481

However, its efficient design and practical implementation has not yet been achieved on mote platforms that are typical in wireless sensor network due to resource constrains. In this paper, we propose StructS-XCorr: cross-correlation via structured sparse representation, a new computing framework for ranging based on ?1 1 -norm minimization [1] and structured sparsity. The key idea is to compress the ranging signal samples on the mote by efficient random projections and transfer them to a central device; where a convex optimization process estimates the range by exploiting the sparse signal structure in the proposed correlation dictionary. Through theoretical validation, extensive empirical studies and experiments on an end-to-end acoustic ranging system implemented on resource limited off-the-shelf sensor nodes, we show that the proposed framework can achieve up to two orders of magnitude better performance compared to other approaches such as working on DCT domain and downsampling. Compared to the standard cross-correlation, it is able to obtain range estimates with a bias of 2-6 cm with 30 percent and approximately 100 cm with 5 percent compressed measurements. Its structured sparsity model is able to improve the ranging accuracy by 40 percent under challenging recovery conditions (such as high compression factor and low signal-to-noise ratio) by overcoming limitations due to dictionary coherence. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",compressed sensing; cross-correlation; location sensing; positioning; Ranging; sparse approximation; structured sparsity; ?1-norm minimization,Compressed sensing; Convex optimization; Range finding; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Tracking (position); 1-norm minimizations; Cross correlations; Location-sensing; positioning; Sparse approximations; Structured sparsities; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15361233,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

End-to-end delay, power consumption, and communication cost are some of the most important metrics in a wireless sensor networks when routing from a source to a destination. Recent approaches using the swarm intelligence (SI) technique proved that the local interaction of several simple agents to meet a global goal has a significant impact on WSNs routing. In this paper, a proposed routing algorithm that has an ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm with an endocrine cooperative particle swarm optimisation algorithm (ECPSOA) is used to improve the various metrics in WSNs routing. The ACO algorithm uses mobile agents as ants to identify the most feasible and best path in a network. Additionally, the ACO algorithm helps to locate paths between two nodes in a network. In the ECPSOA, finds the best solution for a particle's position and velocity, which can enhance the capacity of global search and improve the speed of convergence and accuracy of the algorithm. This routing algorithm has an improved performance when compared with the simple ACO algorithm in terms of delay, power consumption, and communication cost.

We assume that the state of the system is evolving in an independent and non-stationary fashion and the 'common information' available at each node is distributed and delayed. Such stochastic optimization is an integral part of many important problems in wireless networks such as scheduling, routing, resource allocation and crowd sensing. We propose an approximate distributed Drift-Plus-Penalty (DPP) algorithm, and show that it achieves a time average cost (and penalties) that is within > 0 of the optimal cost (and constraints) with high probability. Also, we provide a condition on the convergence time t for this result to hold. In particular, for any delay D ? 0 in the common information, we use a coupling argument to prove that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to the optimal solution.

So, data processing is a challenge in WMSN. Exploring low-overhead data compression technique is a solution towards this problem. In this work we propose an energy saving image compression technique for WMSN using curve fitting technique considering the application of post-disaster situation analysis through image capturing of the affected area. Upon employing the method on the macroblocks of sensory image, curve fitting coefficients are generated and transmitted towards the sink thereby saves energy by transmitting reduced volume of data.

Both the models have been analyzed based on the charge and long term self-discharge responses obtained through experimentation and simulation. The device under test is the Maxwell BCAP0100 P270 T07 supercapacitor. First, it has been charged at 2A constant current to its rated voltage; then, has been left for self-discharge. The terminal voltage has been collected for total charging time as well as self-discharge for 8000 seconds. The data have been acquired using National Instruments (NI) hardware and LabVIEW software.

Therefore, more sophisticated techniques are required to combat with network congestion. Various constrained resources of the WSN are to be taken into account while devising such mechanisms. Different approaches for congestion detection and avoidance have been introduced in the past few years. The traditional flooding and gossiping algorithm can cause loss of data. To tackle some of the issues, this paper presents a novel approach for congestion control based dynamic routing. In the proposed work, whenever the packet traversal experiences the congestion, an alternate path is computed to reroute the packets on the new path. The proposed work has three phases namely congestion detection, alternate path computation and re-routing the packets on new path.

It encompasses arms, ammunition weapons, tools and confidential data. A large number of soldiers are active at the national borders and hostile regions to safeguard the civilian people and enhance the security to them; though, in the case of any emergency, some mechanism based on the modern electronics and technology is essential to alert the military officers active in surveillance areas so that they can make a prompt arrangement to lock the security and tighten the forces. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication which can play an effective role in the monitoring of the remote areas for applications like military surveillance, seismic activity monitoring, earthquake detection and disaster relief operations etc. The nodes are randomly deployed in the sensor field for such applications because of which the density of nodes in some part of the area to be monitored will be more and other areas might be very less. Another problem is the physical access to sensor nodes in these areas is extremely challenging, so the human intervention is not easy. Thus, the replacement of nodes or recharging their batteries is practically impossible. The paper presents a prototype model of the surveillance system for the military application using wireless sensor networks and the work progress accomplished till now has been reported.

The sensor networks can be used for various application areas (e.g., health, military, home). Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the apphcation and network architecture. There is a design trade-off between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. This paper provides method for clustering and cluster head selection to WSN to improve energy efficiency. It presents a comparison between LEACH and R-LEACH on the basis of the network lifetime. In this paper, we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system hfetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. Further, we modify one of the most prominent wireless sensor networks routing protocol LEACH as R-LEACH by introducing efficient cluster head replacement and inter cluster communication. Our R-LEACH, in comparison with LEACH performs better using metrics of cluster head formation, network hfe time.

In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), the sensor nodes collaboratively work to explore and observe the unexplored remote area of sea. In this work, we propose event driven data gathering and routing in UWSN. The proposed work operates in three phases namely (1) event detection, (2) data gathering, and (3) routing. The proposed scheme is as follows. Upon detection of the event in the sea bed, the elliptical structures are created at the sea bed, mid of the sea and on surface layer. The radius of the elliptical structure is directly proportional to the impact of the event. At each elliptical structure, the Elliptical structure Head (EH) are elected for data gathering. EH of respective elliptical structure gathers data locally using horizontal links and sends it to center node of the ellipse. Bottom elliptical structure center node transmits its data to the upper layer (sea mid layer), in-turn it sends to the surface layer center node and in turn center node of the surface layer sends it to the sink node.

Undoubtedly homogeneous activities with network are erased with heterogeneous sensor network. But the network performance may be slowly degraded at the point of boundary of the network. Sensor Network domain issues are raised from the energy of the battery. In this paper, we are addressing the energy consumption by tackling sensors usage. A node which is not transferring the packet is referred as Void. These voids are expected to be at the boundary of the clusters. Here the mobile node which has more energy is moved near to the boundary void node and replace the Relay void node. In the boundary, a node which is near to the base station is highly responsible and loaded with more tasks. The task is aggregating data from different nodes deployed in the network and transfer the messages to the base station. A node which is not transferring the packets to the base station at boundary can be replaced by other mobile node. The replacement is done using the algorithm Mobile Node Movement to Boundary. The intension for mobile relay scheme is to support a complete transfer of messages and lifetime for sensor networks. © 2016 IEEE.",Cluster Head (CH); Mobile node; Mobile Node Movement to Boundary (MNMB); Relay void; Replacement; Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN),Base stations; Energy utilization; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster head; Dynamic sensor; Heterogeneous sensor networks; Mobile nodes; Mobile relays; Relay void; Replacement; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Since, the sensor is a battery operated device the lifetime of each sensor is reduced. Therefore effective cluster formation and routing is needed to prevent the sensor node to die earlier. The existing approach consumes excess energy during routing. This was due to increased overhead on the cluster head that has to perform all the work. The proposed work introduces a technique named as Honey Bee Optimization that aims to reduce the energy consumption by finding an optimal route with low cost. The proposed approach is to extend the lifetime of a network and throughput and it delivers better performance than existing method in terms of the energy efficiency, link quality, and scalability.

The collection of enormous amount of homogenous sensor nodes forms the Wireless Sensor Network. These sensor nodes have restricted battery power and memory and so the limited amount of energy is considered as the major issue. To overcome this issue several mechanisms were proposed, among them clustering is a popular way which minimizes the consumption of energy in the sensor nodes and thus the life span of the Wireless Sensor Network can be increased. Grouping the sensor nodes in an energy efficient and distributed approach is considered as the important issue in clustering. Hotspots problem and energy hole problem are the problems faced by the non-distributed clustering. So in order to triumph over these issues, a Fuzzy Based Dynamic Clustering (FDC) in Wireless Sensor Network is proposed. Also a new fitness function for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed which discovers the possible cluster heads The hotspots problem and energy hole problem is overcome by the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which chooses unique radius for each cluster head thus unequal clustering is formed. A fair comparison is done between this proposed algorithm and some existing algorithms.

Sensor nodes are deployed in region to be observed. They sense quantity of interest. It may be temperature, pressure, humidity, solar radiation and so on. The sensed readings are transferred to a central node known as sink or base station. Often networks are heterogeneous in nature i.e. more than one types of sensors are deployed in given region. In homogeneous networks, only one type of nodes are present. Once nodes are deployed, a tree is formed rooted at sink. It is difficult to achieve perfect aggregation in heterogeneous networks. Unlike homogeneous networks, nodes may have more than one types of packets coming in and going out. To maximize chances of aggregation, node should forward every packet to a parent where it can be aggregated. Thus a node may have to select more than one parents. This means that tree formation process should be done keeping heterogeneity in consideration. We have extended joint distributed scheduling and tree formation proposed in literature for heterogeneous networks.

In this paper we have provided a solution to detect malicious nodes which perform radio transmission power control attack and sinkhole attack in wireless sensor networks. In the proposed approach, data transmission is divided into multiple rounds of equal time duration. Each node chooses the parent node in the beginning of the round for forwarding the packet towards sink. Each node adds its identity in the packet as a routing path marker and encrypts before forwarding to parent. Child node observes the parent, handles acknowledgement from 2-hop distance node and decides the trust on parent based on successful and unsuccessful transactions. Each node sends a trust value report via multiple paths to Sink at the end of the round. Sink identifies the malicious node by comparing trust value report received from each node with number of data packets received. Simulated the algorithm in NS-3 and performance analysis compared with other recently proposed approach. Simulation results show that proposed method detect the malicious nodes efficiently and early. © 2016 IEEE.",Bad mouthing attack; Malicious node; Power control attack; Sinkhole attack; Trust based; WSN,Image coding; Network security; Power control; Radio transmission; Wireless sensor networks; Bad mouthing; Malicious nodes; Open communication; Performance analysis; Security in wireless sensor networks; Sinkhole attack; Transmission power control; Trust based; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In this paper, we present a node revocation and key update protocol in a clustered network setup. The proposed protocol considers that the communication in a clustered network is secured using a common group secret which is distributed by the respective cluster head only to the authorized nodes in the cluster. The protocol uses Chinese remainder theorem based group key broadcast to revoke the victim node and update the group key for remaining valid nodes.

In order to improve the aforementioned parameters the energy consumption must be kept at minimum. The mote and network level energy consumption is evaluated, analyzed for real and emulated Zolertia Z1 motes so as to know the factors on which it depends. The mote level energy consumption is evaluated based on the amount of current drawn and the supply voltage for the time spent by the mote in processing, transmitting and receiving the packets. To ease the evaluation on per mote basis a small scale 6LoWPAN is considered. The network level energy consumption is evaluated based on the routing protocol overhead, the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) overhead, the received signal strength indication (Received Signal Strength Indication), the positions of the motes, the percentage duty cycle and various states of motes like processing, receiving and transmitting. Three major observations are drawn from the experiments and simulations; First, maximum energy is consumed at the mote level in receiving state and found to be higher than that in transmitting and processing states on an average by 10.94 and 27.24 percent respectively. Second, energy consumed at the network level depends on the composite effect of the received signal strength, average overhead bytes in control as well as in data packets, the percentage duty cycle of the motes and activities carried out by the motes in various states.

Most of the routing protocols available in the literature are prone to high control overhead and are less efficient. An elastic routing technique utilizing overhearing feature, is an efficient protocol with less control overhead for routing the data, from a single static source to a mobile sink. But, when there are multiple static sources, the delivery of data to the mobile sink pose huge delay and high traffic. Here we propose an efficient routing algorithm utilizing the feature of overhearing to route the packets from all the source nodes to the mobile sink. We use a modified version of iterative-1 Steiner tree algorithm with elastic routing, for finding the shortest path to the mobile destination, with minimum control packet overhead. Calculation of Steiner points is dynamic in nature, so as to adapt to the topological changes. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is better in-terms of data rate, energy efficiency and control overhead. Test-bed results indicate that the proposed approach can be used effectively in WSN, where topological changes are frequent. © 2016 IEEE.",Dynamic Topology; Elastic Routing; Mobile WSN; Steiner Tree,Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Topology; Trees (mathematics); Control-packet overhead; Dynamic topologies; Efficient protocols; Elastic Routing; Mobile destinations; Mobile WSN; Steiner trees; Topological changes; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In this paper, we present an Asynchronous Algorithm which is Energy Efficient and provides integrated Coverage and Connectivity, called (AAEECC). Our algorithm does not require clock synchronization of nodes at any stage neither does it require exact location information of the nodes. It is low cost, fully distributed and scalable. In the following, we discuss the approach used. First, we build a minimum hopcount graph for connectivity. Second, we propose a scheduling algorithm for providing desired coverage.

One of the mechanism used in WSN for reducing energy consumption is the Transmission Power Control. Transmitting at a constant / highest power level leads to energy wastage and also increases the chances of interference in the network. Hence, by controlling the transmission power, energy can be conserved. In this paper we implement a dynamic transmission power control scheme using PID feedback mechanism.

Among the various wireless domains, Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Networks (WDSN) pose a good support to the dynamics that arise when the nodes are induced with mobility. In the Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Network (WDSN), major consideration is on utilizing the energy efficiently among the mobile nodes. Various techniques are used to attain energy efficiency in Zigbee WDSN. Among them, clustering the nodes is one of the best methods, since they aim at reducing the energy dissipation and increasing the life span of the network. Hence, in this paper, the performance of Zigbee WDSN using clustering scheme is done by considering the nodes with mobility and compared with performance of Zigbee WDSN using non clustering technique. The proposed work is summarized as follows: the network is deployed as clusters and the remaining energy of the node is determined by utilizing clustering protocol. In each cluster, the clustering protocol opts for the node with the maximum remaining energy as the head of that cluster. Then STR algorithm is utilized to route the sensed data from the member nodes to the cluster head. Hence, the clustering technique and STR, route the information through the shortest path paving the way for enhanced average residual energy and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The simulations are done by using ns2 and performance metrics such as average residual energy and PDR are computed and analyzed for non clustered and clustered method. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; residual energy; STR; WDSN; Zigbee,Cluster analysis; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Average residual energy; clustering; Clustering techniques; Dynamic sensor networks; Packet delivery ratio; Performance analysis; Residual energy; WDSN; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The key parameters that play a major role in designing a protocol for WSNs are its energy efficiency and computational feasibility, as sensor nodes are resource constrained. Variation in sensor nodes distance from base station and inter node distances primarily cause unequal energy consumption among the sensor nodes. The energy consumption varies with time and causes degradation of system performance. LEACH is the first ever clustered based routing protocol which provides elegant solutions, suffers from the drawback due to the randomized cluster head (CH) election.

Wireless Sensor Networks works in numerous critical situations like battlefields, forest fire detection, territory monitoring and many more circumstances. WSN have numerous design concerns out of which security is the key factor because it affects the overall performance of the network. In this paper we have evaluate PPS scheme and implement forwarding window technique. In this paper we proposed a time allocation based request forwarding window technique to detect and prevent DoS (Denial of Service) attack. DoS attacks are flooding access amount of packets in the network that consumes the energy of the network. In Profile based Protection Scheme (PPS), the behavior of all the nodes deployed in the network are observed. When the attacker floods the network with Route Request messages, the abnormal behavior of the attacker, is detected at the end. But in the Forwarding window technique the attacker is detected in route request phase and prevention will be done in route reply phase. In proposed technique, if any node floods the route request messages more than the dynamic time then it will detect as attacker. And the node which detected this, will inform the others about the ID of the malicious node. The modified route request for forwarding phase will continue until request reaches destination. The destination node will not choose the path containing the detected nodes. The performance is measured on the basis of performance metrics like total packet sent, remaining energy, throughput etc. In this, simulation results are shows that proposed work successfully detect and prevent DoS attack. © 2016 IEEE.",DoS attack; Forwarding Window Technique; Issues; PPS; Security Goal; Suspicious mechanisms; Wireless sensor network,Computer crime; Deforestation; Denial-of-service attack; Distributed computer systems; Floods; Network security; Polypropylenes; Wireless sensor networks; Dynamic forwarding; Forest fire detection; Issues; Performance metrics; Protection schemes; Remaining energies; Security goals; Window techniques; Sensor nodes,,Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Distributed fault tolerant clustering algorithm (DFCA) for fault tolerance has a drawback as the load on neighbouring CH increase and energy consumption is more. Improved distributed fault tolerant algorithm, IDFCA technique works to reduce the energy consumption by introducing hierarchy formation process of selecting CH and it also overcome the situation of faulty node.

Network layer have ability to swap network service data units between two transport entities above a network connection depending same feature like latency and energy. The network layer deals with directing the information supplied by the transport layer. It is in charge of determining the task of locations and how parcels are sent Routing. Network layer is vulnerable for different types of attacks like a Sinkhole, Wormhole, Sybil, Selective Forwarding, Hello Flood, Black Hole, greyhole and so on. In this paper we survey different attacks on network layer like a black hole and wormhole attack. Black hole attacks attracts network traffic and drop all data packets. One of the most popular and serious attack in wireless sensor network is the wormhole attack. It is an especially severe attack on routing protocols for specially appointed systems in which two or additionally colluding attackers record packets at one location, and tunnel them to another location for a replay at that remote location. When this attack targets routing control packets, the nodes that are near the attackers are guarded from any option route with more than maybe a couple bounces to the remote area.

One of the most important constraints is unpredictable obstacles. Handling obstacles during relay node placement is complicated because of complexity involved to estimate the shape and size of obstacles. This paper presents an Obstacle-resistant relay node placement strategy (ORRNP). The proposed solution not only handles the obstacles but also estimates best locations for relay node placement in the network.

In this type of attack, an adversary intelligently captures the node(s) and extracts the cryptographic information to destroy the privacy, safety and reliability of the network. We propose a novel hybrid approach for constructing the path vulnerability matrix that maximizes the attacking efficiency and lowers the resource expenditure of the adversary. The main strength of the proposed matrix lies in incorporating various criteria such as the type of application running on the nodes, capturing cost, key dominance ranking, articulation point and intersecting shortest path nodes in estimating the vulnerability. The location of the data sink is considered as a major factor in estimating the vulnerability of the nodes in the network. The proposed matrix is compared with existing attacking strategies in terms of the number of attacking rounds, energy cost and fraction of compromised traffic. Although in this paper, we have considered adversarial point of view but the proposed matrix can be extended for the defender application also. The path vulnerability matrix provides vulnerability estimation that can be used to analyze system security weakness and helps to defend against them effectively and efficiently. The performance of proposed approach has been validated with respect to average path compromise ratio, average routing path length and average route successful ratio.

These types of networks have a wide range of applications including habitat monitoring, health monitoring, data acquisition in hazardous environmental conditions and military operations. Sensor nodes are resource constrained having limited communication range, battery and processing power. Sensor nodes are prone to failure and can be also physically captured by an adversary. One of the main concerns in WSNs is to provide security, especially in the cases where they are deployed for military applications and monitoring. Further, WSNs are prone to various attacks such as wormhole, sinkhole and blackhole attacks. A blackhole attack is a kind of denial of service attack, which is very difficult to detect and defend and such blackhole attack, if happens, affects the entire performance of the network. In addition, it causes high end-to-end delay and less throughput with less packet delivery ratio. The situation can be worst if multiple blackhole attacker nodes present in the network. As a result, detection and prevention of the blackhole attack becomes crucial in WSNs. In this paper, we aim to propose a new efficient group-based technique for the detection and prevention of multiple blackhole attacker nodes in WSNs. In our approach, the entire WSN is divided into several clusters and each cluster has a powerful high-end sensor node (called a cluster head), which is responsible for the detection of blackhole attacker nodes, if present, in that cluster. The proposed scheme achieves about 90 % detection rate and 3.75 % false positive rate, which are significantly better than the existing related schemes. Furthermore, our scheme is efficient and thus, it is very appropriate for practical applications in WSNs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Blackhole attacks; Detection and prevention; Hierarchical wireless sensor networks; NS2; Security,Computer crime; Data acquisition; Denial-of-service attack; Military applications; Military operations; Network security; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Blackhole attacks; Environmental conditions; Hierarchical wireless sensor networks; Limited communication range; Packet delivery ratio; Security; Wireless communication technology; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Das, A.K.; Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: iitkgp.akdas@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986316061

The sensor nodes are generally tiny and made of irreplaceable power source and limited capacity for computing, communication, and storage. The power constraint necessitates that the WSN routing protocols conserve energy as critical factor to maximize the network lifetime. Cluster-based approaches are popularly used for its energy efficiency where some nodes designated as Cluster Heads (CHs) organize WSNs for data aggregation and energy saving. The CH is responsible for gathering data from the cluster nodes and conveying it to the base station due to which higher energy drain occurs at CH leading to uneven network degradation. Thus, the selection of CH is critical for improving the WSN performance and lifetime.

Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication aspects of the WSN's, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured.

The most important issue in this type of networks is energy constraints. In this area several researches have been done from which clustering is one of the most effective solutions. The goal of clustering is to divide network into sections each of which has a Cluster Head (CH). The task of cluster heads collection, data aggregation and transmission to the base station is undertaken. Choosing CHs in WSN in a Non-deterministic Polynomial-hard issue because optimum data collection with effective energy conservation is not capable of being resolved in polynomial time. In the current work, novel variations of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are presented which are particularly formulated for excellent functioning in dynamic settings. The primary notion is the extension of single population PSO as well as charged PSO techniques through the construction of interactive multi-swarms. Updating as well as recalculating algorithms for connected dominating set is also proposed for when topologies of ad hoc wireless networks change. Exhaustive simulations reveal that the suggested method performs excellently in comparison to PSO as well as Hybrid Energy-Effective Distributed clustering protocols. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cluster heads (CHs); Dominating sets; Multi swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wireless sensor network (WSN),Data acquisition; Mobile telecommunication systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Polynomial approximation; Sensor nodes; Wireless ad hoc networks; Ad hoc wireless networks; Cluster head; Clustering in wireless sensor networks; Connected Dominating Set; Distributed clustering; Dominating sets; Multi-swarm particle swarm optimizations; Multi-swarms; Wireless sensor networks,"Suganthi, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Sai Ram Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: suganthivasanth81@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981288167

As per consensus theory, apart from the averaging scheme employed by the consensus algorithm, another factor that affects the consensus-based algorithms performance is the topological connectivity of the networks. In topologies of lower degree of connectivity like sparse network, these one-hop consensus synchronization algorithms have exhibited poor performance in terms of convergence speed and synchronization accuracy. This motivates the design of multi-hop consensus time synchronization algorithm for sparse WSNs. In this paper, we have proposed a multi-hop consensus time synchronization algorithm, multi-hop Selective Average Time Synchronization (SATS), for sparse and multi-hop WSNs.

Fast data delivery from source node to sink node is also required for many applications. Sometimes data transmission towards the sink may be interrupted because of failure of nodes in a particular area. The various such requirements of routing data in a WSN are sometimes contradictory and routing algorithms must be designed keeping in mind all these requirements. In this paper three routing algorithms are proposed for multi-sink partitioned network. In these three algorithms, the source nodes or intermediate nodes select a next node to forward the data to the destination or sink. This process repeats until the data reaches the sink. In the first technique, the next node is chosen considering its distance from sink node as a criterion. In the second technique, remaining energy of the neighboring nodes is used as a criterion for selection of the next node. The combination of these two criteria is considered in the third technique and a multiple criteria decision analysis technique is used. A recovery technique from area failure is also proposed and incorporated in the above mentioned algorithms. The algorithms are designed and implemented in multi-sink environment for partitioned wireless sensor networks.

Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty and has tolerance of imprecise data with high power of precision. In this study, fuzzy logic based multi-attribute trust model is suggested. The proposed trust model has message success rate, elapsed time at node, correctness and fairness as trust metrics.

The focus is about clock synchronization, delay measurement in time synchronization and fine grained network time synchronization. The recent advancements in the sensor technology has led to the miniaturization of the sensors and its related components, and similarly reduced the cost to a larger extent. This enabled an active rise in the research of large scale networks of sensors. The synchronization of sensor nodes is critical to its effective operation especially the time synchronization, for the data fusion, duty cycling and so on. Most of the algorithms for synchronization that were proposed recently do the same work. The server periodically sends a piece of information or message that contains the current value of clock to the client. This happens in case of time synchronization of the sensor nodes. The proper definition for sensor networks comes as follows. It is a special type of ad-hoc network, in which the nodes, also referred to ass wireless devices get together and the form a network without any need for underlying infrastructure spontaneously. They can cooperate only by forwarding packets to each other since there are no routers in an environment without any infrastructure. When the environment is distributed in nature, then more complex is the scenario. But time synchronization is an important component of such distributed environments. It aims to provide a common time for the local clocks in their network (Sivrikaya and Yener in IEEE Netw 18(4):4550, 2004). For applications of networking protocols, at any particular instant, there should be a common view of the clock in the network. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Clock time; Evolutionary computing; Quality of Service (QoS); Routing; Soft computing; Time synchronization; Wireless sensor networks (WSN),Ad hoc networks; Clocks; Complex networks; Data fusion; Mechanical clocks; Quality of service; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Soft computing; Synchronization; Telecommunication networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Clock Synchronization; Distributed environments; Evolutionary computing; Network time-synchronization; Networking protocols; Routing; Sensor technologies; Time synchronization; Wireless sensor networks,"Saravanaselvam, N.; Department of CSE, Sri Eshwar College of EngineeringIndia; email: saravanaselvam.n@sece.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974814381

In this paper, we propose a powerful linear statistical model for estimating the state values of the sensor nodes longitudinally, and the estimated state values are used for detecting the anomalous nodes. Our proposed approach is powerful because it considers the effect of the nearest neighbors on the current state values and then detects the anomalous nodes based on the estimated state values. Our method can estimate the missing state values of the sensor nodes, which are kept in sleep mode for energy conservation. We also propose an alternative Bayesian model that is computationally faster for state estimation and anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated through extensive simulation studies, and the usefulness of our algorithm is numerically assessed. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to that of the traditional approaches through simulation studies.

Data accumulation through effective network organizations helps nodes to be split into small sets known as clusters. This grouping of sensor nodes as clusters is known as clustering. All clusters have leaders known as cluster heads (CHs). Clustering networks for minimizing total distance is an NP-hard issue. For a particular network topology, it is hard to discover optimum quantity of cluster-heads as well as their positions. The current article suggests a hybrid differential evolution with multi objective bee swam optimization (MOBSO-DE) for efficient clustering.

Sensor nodes in WSN are deployed in fields with limited power. By nature these nodes are left unattended after deployment. This raises the importance of developing efficient algorithms which are capable of increasing the network lifetime by consuming less energy during the operations. This paper proposes a hybrid clustering energy aware routing protocol (H-CERP) for heterogeneous WSNs. H-CERP is designed to form efficient clusters with less cluster head count than the optimal estimation and uses multihop communication with gateway nodes to communicate with the base station. This novel approach makes our system more advantageous where the network lifetime and coverage of sensors are much vital at no additional cost.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive MAC-frame payload tuning mechanism for wireless body area networks (WBANs) to maximize the probability of successful packet delivery or reliability of the associated sensor nodes based on real-time situation. The enabling algorithm, Adaptively Tuned MAC (AT-MAC), has been proposed to tune the MAC-frame payload of a WBAN sensor node, which is compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. AT-MAC prioritizes sensor nodes based on the seriousness of the health parameters that are being measured by the respective sensor nodes. Further, we consider a Markov chain-based analytical approach that acknowledges the slotted CSMA/CA backoff mechanism with retry limits, as described in the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. We derive expressions for reliability, power consumption, and throughput, which are the key metrics to evaluate the network performance of the proposed protocol, and analyze the impact of MAC parameters on them. Finally, results indicate that the low rate and low power IEEE 802.15.4 can be used effectively in case of WBANs if the payload is tuned properly through the proposed algorithm. The proposed AT-MAC algorithm yields around 70 percent increase in reliability of a critical node in a WBAN. © 2016 IEEE.",adaptive payload tuning; critical sensor node; criticality index; IEEE 802.15.4 standard; Markov chain model; Wireless body area network,Access control; Adaptive control systems; Body sensor networks; Carrier sense multiple access; Chains; Chip scale packages; Markov processes; Medium access control; Quality of service; Reliability; Sensor nodes; Standards; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Analytical approach; Back-off mechanisms; Health parameters; IEEE 802.15.4 standards; Markov chain models; Medium access control(MAC); Reliable communication; Wireless body area network; Wireless local area networks (WLAN),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15361233,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Swarm intelligence (SI) based metaheuristic like Ant colony optimization, Particle swarm optimization and more recently Artificial bee colony (ABC) has shown desirable properties of being adaptive to solve optimization problem of energy efficient clustering in WSNs. ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs due to ease of implementation however, its search equation contributes to its insufficiency due to poor exploitation phase and storage of certain control parameters. Thus, we propose an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved search equation to enhance its exploitation capabilities and in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Students-t distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Students-t distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient bee clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherit the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads and improve energy efficiency in WSNs.

To bring these paradigms to life, self-sustainable wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes capable of seamless and maintenance free operation at remote locations are desired. Recently, radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) circuits capable of harvesting RF power transmitted by base stations, TV towers and other ambient RF sources have been developed. Low power requirements and architectural compatibility between WSN nodes and RFEH circuits make RFEH a promising and feasible solution for WSN nodes. In this paper, a novel multi-stage decision-making policy (DMP) for RFEH enabled WSN nodes has been proposed. It offers an intelligence, via online learning algorithm, for characterization and selection of frequency bands based on their RF potential especially in the dynamic spectrum environment. Furthermore, proposed DMP supports multi-antenna multi-band harvesting capabilities of the RFEH circuits. The final contribution includes tunable RFEH duration that leads to significant improvement in the harvested energy and fewer number of frequency band switchings (FBS). Derived theoretical performance bounds and simulation results validate the superiority of proposed DMP in terms of the harvested RF energy and throughput of the WSN nodes. Furthermore, the fewer number of FBS makes the proposed DMP suitable for resource-constrained WSN nodes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor nodes,Decision making; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Low power electronics; Smart city; Wireless sensor networks; Architectural compatibility; Distributed decision making; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Online learning algorithms; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor node; Sensor nodes,"Darak, S.J.; ECE DepartmentIndia; email: sumit@iiitd.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019889674

On the other hand, the advancements in the areas of cooperative spectrum sharing protocols have enabled efficient use of spectrum band between primary and secondary users. Owing to this fact, in this paper, we consider an energy-constrained secondary user which harvests energy from the primary signal and forwards this latter with the guarantee of spectrum access. A time-splitting cooperative spectrum sharing (TS-CSS) at the amplify-And-forward relay is proposed. Assuming a Nakagami-m fading model, exact closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities of the primary and secondary users are derived. From the obtained results, it is shown that the secondary user can carry its own transmission without adversely effecting the performance of the primary user.

Existing Routing(THVR) [13] is based velocity of Two-Hop Velocity and protocol relates two-hop velocity to delay to select the next forwarding node, that has overhead of exchanging control packets, and depleting the available energy in nodes. We propose a Real-Time Reliable Data delivery based on Virtual Coordinates Routing (RRDVCR) algorithm, based on the number of hops to the destination rather than geographic distance. Selection of forwarding node is based on packet progress offered by two-hops, link quality and available energy at the forwarding nodes. All these metric are co-related by dynamic co-relation factor. The proposed protocol uses selective acknowledgment scheme that results in lower overhead and energy consumption. Simulation results shows that there is about 22% and 9.5% decrease in energy consumption compared to SPEED [8] and THVR [13] respectively, 16% and 38% increase in packet delivery compared to THVR [13] and SPEED [8] respectively, and overhead is reduced by 50%. © 2016 IEEE.",Count [MTX]; Dynamic co-relation factor: f(rt); Link reliability; Maximum transmission; Virtual coordinating routing,Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Available energy; Count [MTX]; End to end delay; Forwarding nodes; Link reliability; Reliable data delivery; Virtual coordinates; Virtual coordinating routing; Power management (telecommunication),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

A wireless sensor network consists of a large number of low-cost, low-power sensor nodes that are deployed in a specific application domain to sense different environmental parameters, suitable for the intended application. Geographic routing mechanism is very much suitable for the highly energy constrained wireless sensor networks due to its less memory and computational overhead. The presence of holes can defeat the advantages of geographic routing mechanism and may even harm the objective of network deployment. This paper conducts a survey on the various types of holes, cause for their occurrence and various techniques to deal with them. The various mechanisms that are used to recover from holes tend to increase energy consumption of sensor nodes and thus affect network lifetime. Thus the survey concentrates on energy efficient mechanisms to handle holes with an aim to improve network connectivity and network lifespan that will extend the applicability of wireless sensor networks. © 2016 IEEE.",Connectivity; Holes; Network Lifetime; Wireless Sensor Networks,Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; MEMS; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Surveys; Computational overheads; Connectivity; Environmental parameter; Holes; Micro electro mechanical system; Mission critical applications; Network connectivity; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

To establish a session key in sensor node communication is a challenging job for WSNs. Key exchange and group key transfer protocols based on trusted key distribution center can be applied for the network infrastructures with fixed topology. But these protocols are impractical for large scale distributed mobile adhoc networks. This is mainly because of the limitation in communication range, limited battery power in sensors and unknown mobile adhoc network's physical toplology prior to deployment. The traditional key pre-distribution solutions are infeasible to practically apply in large scale mobile sensor networks. In this paper, we have presented a key management scheme for large scale distributed mobile sensor nodes based on probabilistic key distribution.

Stream ciphers constitute a popular choice for ensuring security of data communications in such applications. To keep the cost, complexity and energy expenditure in the implementation of such stream cipher algorithms low, the short duration of the wireless communication sessions are often exploited by using a lightweight cryptographic (LWC) algorithm. Such an LWC algorithm will provide the desired security during the short session at the required speed, and a new key will be used for the next session so that an adversary would not have enough time to decipher the key of any session. In this paper, we propose a technique based on generating stream of random keys from streaming twitter data. The sequence of random keys generated by the proposed tweet-based key generation (TBKG) algorithm has been tested by the NIST statistical test suite for randomness. The test results show that TBKG algorithm passes all the fifteen tests for randomness. Also, the period of the key values is quite high, thus making it suitable for use over short sessions involving communication of 350 MB data through the wireless network. The unpredictability of the generated random key values is governed by the unpredictable nature of the tweets from thousands of individuals. The algorithm is very simple to implement with low computational and energy overhead. © 2017 IEEE.",Internet of Things; Key generation; Lightweight cryptography; Mobile transactions; Stream cipher; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks,Cryptography; Random processes; Security of data; Social networking (online); Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Key generation; Light-weight cryptography; Mobile transaction; Stream Ciphers; Wireless communications; Internet of things,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Ace of the adaptive features of context-awareness is contextual reconfiguration. Contextual reconfiguration involves discovering remote service(s) based on context and binding them to the application components to realize new behaviors, which may be needed to satisfy user needs or to enrich user experience. One of the steps in the reconfiguration process involves a remote lookup to discover the service(s) based on context. This remote lookup process provides the largest contribution to reconfiguration time and this is due to fact that the remote calls are much slower than local calls. The use of cross-layer information from lower layers opens the door to developing efficient replication schemes that account of the specific features of WSNs (e.g., contention between the nodes to access the wireless medium and traffic interference). This service program enables those infrastructure nodes to participate in content distribution and act the part of replica servers. Therefore, it affects system performance. The proposed concept is the compounding of two contributions stated as: (i) A new improved routing technique is proposed, whose main destination is to get at the energy consumption balance and prolonging wireless sensor network lifetime. We prove that the public presentation of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to be within a constant divisor of the globally optimal performance, with far more benign worst case ratios than in prior employment, even in asymmetric scenarios, and (ii) Content is typically partitioned into two disjoint sets of inelastic as well as elastic content. Cooperative caching is shown to be capable to reduce content provisioning cost which heavily depends on service and pricing dependencies among various stakeholders, including content providers, network service suppliers, and end consumers. © 2016 IEEE.",Caching; Contextual Reconfiguration; Replication; WSN,Costs; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Sensor nodes; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Wireless networks; Application components; Caching; Contextual Reconfiguration; Energy consumption balances; Pervasive computing applications; Reconfiguration process; Reconfiguration time; Replication; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Therefore, in this work we propose a reactive distributed scheme for detecting faulty nodes. The scheme is able to detect transient and permanent faulty nodes accurately by exchanging fewer messages. In existing fault detection schemes, nodes exchange too many messages after every specific interval to detect suspicious node. However, in the proposed scheme comparatively much less messages are exchanged within a limited geographical area around the suspicious node only and that too when the node suspects its own readings. In the proposed scheme, each node exploits the temporal correlation in its own readings to detect any suspicious behavior. In order to confirm its status, the suspicious node communicates with its immediate neighbors who may be locally good or possible faulty with a certain level of confidence. Thus, the scheme utilizes the strength of both spatial and temporal correlation to find faulty nodes.

In the recent years, the demand for low rate wireless data transmission has been increased drastically in small scale industrial and non-industrial applications. The different traffic flows are increased by incorporating a variety of distinct sensing devices. In particular, injection of different traffic into network makes the communication system unstable and unreliable because of unnecessarily resource utilization, wasting energy for surplus delivery management and violation of time constraints. This paper aims to presents the new priority-based algorithm at actuator node for appropriate classification and categorization of data packets for delay sensitive and delaytolerant applications. A novel real-time priority-based scheduler (RTPS) is proposed to handle heterogeneous data flows simultaneously according to their transmission type. The priority-based data delivery is an essential research topic for low rate multi-event IEEE 802.15.4 sensor networks. A priority metric is designed to dynamically control various types of traffic based flows with considerations of packet type, delay, and buffer processing rate. TestBed results describe significant improvements in data reporting mechanism for delay sensitive and delay-tolerant applications over various topologies.

Although, wireless sensor network is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication, we find very less development of real time applications using the sensor networks. The main reason for this is the design of the motes to be deployed in the sensor field according to the requirement of application is difficult job and expensive in terms of investment of money. Moreover, the replacement of the batteries or repairing of the devices becomes a very challenging task as the human intervention in the deployment areas is next to impossible. Hence assurance of long lived sensor nodes and prolonged network life time can be impacted by inducing adequate amount of sleep scheduling to the nodes. This paper presents a communication protocol based on optimal back-off sleep time to give a right amount of sleeping to the sensing devices in the monitoring area due to which energy efficient coverage can be achieved. The advantage of the design is that based on the unused battery, randomly the sleep duration is calculated and given to the probing node by the active node. Hence, full utilization of the active node till it dies is ensured. The life of an individual node thus increases since the time of activity of it is smartly scheduled. The blacklisting of nodes like to be faulty or fail helps to overcome problem of node failure. The simulation of the protocol, analysis of the results and further scope of the development of the proposed design is discussed. © 2016 IEEE.",Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient performance etc; Optimal backoff sleep time,Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuits; Investments; Power management (telecommunication); Sleep research; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient coverages; Human intervention; Real-time application; Sleep time; Wireless communications; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Several researchers have addressed these issues through their own innovations and discoveries of different schemes, methods, techniques or mathematical models and architectures or applications, using a variety of node designs. This in turn, has lead to multiple different choices of hardware and software options. However, this has not simplified the process of setting up application testbeds considering energy consumption. There is no readily available solution for setting up a WSN with user selected profiles and parameters. Multiple communication protocols, routing protocols, signal calibration and propagation methods, data aggregation schemes, clustering formations with multiple variations have been proposed for different research objectives.

Key management is a major categorisation and includes several important elements namely, key updating, key distribution and most importantly key generation. Most of the physically deployed WSN has been deployed with pre distributed random keys which are seldom updated. This proves a challenge to the underlying encryption algorithm which gets subjected to cryptanalysis and thus loses its viability. The connectivity provided in WSN contradicts the network security principle of resilience and research community has not been able to provide viable alternatives to key updating. To address this problem a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) based random key management scheme is proposed for heterogeneous WSN is proposed. Deployment details are pre-requisitely known and a RSSI-LQI based random key distribution and key updating mechanism is designed.

With more critically important applications being designed for the WSN, security becomes a matter of prime importance. Though a lot of work has been carried out in the field of security for WSN, yet providing a robust security framework remains an open research challenge. One such open research domain is prevention of node replication attack, where the adversary takes control of a node from the network and steals all the security related credentials like node identity, keys, keying mechanism etc. and generates duplicate clones of the compromised node with the same security parameters. Building a defence mechanism against such node replication attacks has become an important research topic. The design principles has given directions to more threatening and different challenges which are more difficult to detect then typical attacks that are application dependent. There are several protocols that have been documented regarding node replication attacks. However, in depth study of this protocols reveal that robust prevention mechanism against such kind of attack is debatable and several vulnerabilities exist. In this paper, we propose a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Link Quality Indicator (LQI) and Packet Sequence Number based protocol that allows the legitimate nodes to detect the presence of any adversary placed clone node, and reporting it back to the base station thereby preventing a node duplication attack. © 2016 IEEE.",Link Quality Indicator; Node Localisation; Node Replication Attack; Received Signal Strength Indicator; Scalability; Set Operations,Cloning; Engineering research; Integrated circuits; Network security; Packet networks; Scalability; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Link quality indicators; Node localisation; Node Replication Attack; Received signal strength indicators; Set operation; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Therefore, in this work we propose a reactive distributed scheme for detecting faulty nodes. The scheme is able to detect transient and permanent faulty nodes accurately by exchanging fewer messages. In existing fault detection schemes, nodes exchange too many messages after every specific interval to detect suspicious node. However, in the proposed scheme comparatively much less messages are exchanged within a limited geographical area around the suspicious node only and that too when the node suspects its own readings. In the proposed scheme, each node exploits the temporal correlation in its own readings to detect any suspicious behavior. In order to confirm its status, the suspicious node communicates with its immediate neighbors who may be locally good or possible faulty with a certain level of confidence. Thus, the scheme utilizes the strength of both spatial and temporal correlation to find faulty nodes. Also, a confidence level is assigned to each correlated neighbor of suspicious node in order to enhance the detection accuracy. The ns-2 based simulation results show that our scheme performs better by reducing communication overhead and by detecting faulty nodes with high accuracy as compared to existing approaches. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Distributed fault detection; Fault diagnosis; Fault tolerance; Transient fault; Wireless sensor networks,Energy utilization; Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Detection approach; Distributed fault detections; Distributed schemes; Fault detection schemes; Spatial and temporal correlation; Temporal correlations; Transient faults; Fault detection,"Sharma, K.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kpsharma17vce@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046232527

Wireless sensor networks are mainly characterized by their limited amount of energy and memory. Constructing a network with this kind of sensor will lead to additional challenges with energy and memory constraints of wireless sensor network. The success of the wireless sensor network is mainly depends on maximum lifetime with high quality of services (QoS). Clustering is one of widely used technique to increase the lifetime of the network by utilizing energy in an efficient manner. In clustering each sensor node reported to it is Cluster Head (CH). Data fusion is an important QoS parameter when forming multi-model based wireless sensor networks. In this network, multi-model sensor nodes sensed different features and formed long message that are sent to CH. In this paper, it is proposed a fuzzy based data fusion method named Efficient Fuzzy Logic based Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks (EFLDF). The primary goal of this paper is to increase the QoS in terms of data accuracy, eliminating data redundancy and increase the networks lifetime. This proposed method has three level fuzzy inference System (FIS) to improve QoS. First and second levels of FIS is performed in each sensor node, that able to collect and fuse the data before it is transmitted to the CH. Third level of FIS is done in CH to avoid data redundancy.

To address these challenges, technique like secure and energy efficient clustering scheme with data aggregation has been developed. The comparison between LEACH, M-LEACH and the proposed scheme with result analysis is presented in this paper. In this paper, we implement energy efficient clustering scheme [1][2][4][12][15][17][19] with aggregation of information to save the bandwidth requirement, which prolongs the lifetime of a network [8]. The proposed algorithm operates in two-phases. In the first phase clustering is done, in which sensor nodes compute potential score which is based on mobility pattern, density [5] and remaining energy [5] [8] in disseminated manner, then each node decides to become a cluster head(CH), by employing potential score. In second phase, every node chooses its CH [5] which has higher potential score. All cluster members will transmits the data to cluster heads for aggregation and encryption, which is then forwarded to the base station. The results proved that the proposed algorithm has better throughput, packet delivery ratio with reduced packet drop, lesser energy consumption and ensures data security compared with LEACH. © 2016 IEEE.",Clustering; Data aggregation; LEACH; MDC; Security; WSN,Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Leaching; Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; Data aggregation; Energy Efficient clustering; Mobile wireless sensor network; Packet delivery ratio; Secure data aggregations; Security; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Reducing energy consumption of nodes is one of the major objectives in the design of wireless sensor networks, as sensors have low power batteries. As data collection is the primary objective of WSNs and it consumes more energy, energy-efficient routing is a prominent solution to reduce the sensors energy consumption. This paper proposes an Energy-efficient and Load Distributed Clustering Algorithm (ELDCA) for routing in dense wireless sensor networks to reduce and distribute the sensors' energy consumption. The network is divided into number of virtual congruent square grids of defined sizes. The algorithm constructs optimal and load balanced clusters at every inner crossing point of grid cells using defined cluster fitness value. As early energy depletion is a major design issue in clustering protocols, the proposed algorithm provides a local substitution for energy suffering clusterheads (CHs).

Recently, mobile sink, trajectory based forwarding and energy supply based node selection have been suggested in literature for optimizing residual energy of nodes. In the most of these approaches, energy consumption has been minimized focusing on the optimization of one particular parameter. The consideration of impact of more than one parameters on energy consumption is lacking in literature. In this context, this paper proposes Huffman coding and Ant Colony Optimization based Lifetime Maximization (HA-LM) technique for randomly distributed WSNs. In particular, ACO based multiple paths exploration and Huffman based optimal path selection consider the impact of two network parameters on energy consumption. The parameters include path length in terms of hop count and residual energy in terms of load of nodes of the path and the least energy node. The construction of multiple paths from source to the sink is mathematically derived based on the concept of two types of ants; namely, Advancing Ant (A-ANT) and Regressive Ant (R-ANT) in ACO. The optimal path is identified from the available multiple paths using Huffman coding. Analytical and simulation results of HA-LM are comparatively evaluated with the state-of-the-art techniques considering four performance metrics; namely, average residual energy, energy consumption, number of alive sensors and standard deviation of energy. The comparative performance evaluation attests the superiority of the proposed technique to the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",ACO; Energy consumption; Green computing; Huffman coding; Lifetime maximization; Optimization; WSNs,Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Energy utilization; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Average residual energy; Green computing; Huffman coding; Lifetime maximization; State-of-the-art techniques; Trajectory based forwarding; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Wireless sensor networks,"Kaiwartya, O.; Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)Malaysia; email: omprakash@utm.my",,Springer New York LLC,19366442,,,,English,Peer-to-Peer Netw.

However, WSNs are vulnerable to various attacks over wireless links, such as eavesdropping and tampering. How to ensure that sensitive or critical information is only available to legal users becomes a challenging issue. Two-factor authentication combining password and smart card perfectly matches this requirement because of its practicality. However, a dozen of two-factor authentication protocols have been suggested in recent years. Owing to the challenging mission of reconciling efficiency and security requirements, it is still challenging to propose a privacy-aware two-factor protocol that is capable of providing various security features while maintaining acceptable efficiency. In this paper, we put forward a privacy-aware two-factor authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography for WSNs. Our new protocol accomplishes various security features necessary for real-life application environments while maintaining acceptable efficiency. We prove that the new protocol fulfills mutual authentication in the BurrowsAbadiNeedham logic.

The limited energy constraint of the sensor node causes a huge impact on the lifetime of the deployed network. The data transmitted by each sensor node cause significant energy consumption and it has to be efficiently used to improve the lifetime of the network. The energy consumption can be reduced significantly by incorporating mobility on a sink node. Thus the mobile data gathering can result in reduced energy consumption among all sensor nodes while transmitting their data. A special mobile sink node named as the mobile data transporter (MDT) is introduced in this paper to collect the information from the sensor nodes by visiting each of them and finally it sends them to the base station. The Data collection by the MDT is formulated as a discrete optimization problem which is termed as a data gathering tour problem. To reduce the distance traveled by the MDT during its tour, a nature-inspired heuristic discrete firefly algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally collect the data from the sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm computes an optimal order to visit the sensor nodes by the MDT to collect their data with minimal travel distance. The proposed algorithm is compared with tree-based data collection approaches and ant colony optimization approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform other approaches minimizing the tour length under different scenarios. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Backbone nodes; Data gathering; Discrete firefly algorithm; Tour length; Wireless sensor networks,Ant colony optimization; Bioluminescence; Data acquisition; Energy utilization; Optimization; Pollution control; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Backbone nodes; Data gathering; Discrete optimization problems; Firefly algorithms; Landslide detection; Mobile data gatherings; Precision Agriculture; Tour length; Sensor nodes,"Yogarajan, G.; Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering CollegeIndia; email: yogarajang@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018311053

Sensor nodes transmit their data towards the static sink in a multi-hop manner. Sensor near the static sink contains all data of other sensors and its own data and thus it drains their energy very fast. So balancing energy throughout the network is important. Efficient utilization of energy is the main objective in WSN for maximization of a network's lifetime. For reducing the energy-hole problem in WSN a mobile sink approach is used. Mobility in WSN contains movement of the node around the network which consumes energy efficiently. However frequently changing the sink topology, determines the energy consumption. Moving the sink node is an effective solution for improving the lifetime of WSN. There are different methods in the literature schedule sink movements and determine sink stay points. Here the mobility of sink node can be considered based on distance of the Cluster Head (CH). Here mobile sink node checks the distance from the all CHs and moves the mobile sink to less distance CH. It also finds out the intersection points of two CHs. Depending on the intersection points mobile sink will move in between and collect data from the both CHs. Hence using this approach mobility will reduce and efficiently consumes more energy in network. © 2016 IEEE.",Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes and Mobility; Wireless sensor network,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Balancing energy; Critical problems; Effective solution; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy-hole problems; Intersection points; Network lifetime; Sink mobility; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Because of smaller size and low power requirement of sensor device use of WSN for watching the surrounding action is increased time to time. Numeral of sensor inside WSN is proportionate to the WSN accuracy. As WSN may be operated in unsupervised and aggressive environment because of this probability of failure of sensor node inside WSN is increased. If any of the sensor node is failed, this will lead to the change the WSN topology, also create network separation, increases the distance between a node pair and reduce secondary available shortest routes.

In envisaged applications of WSN such as detection of forest fire, military surveillance est. battery replacement of sensor nodes are not feasible due to their deployment in hazardous areas and consequently all data routing protocols should be energy efficient. Hierarchical Routing Protocol (HRP) in WSN rotates different responsibilities among nodes with an aim to preserve energy. In this paper we propose a new HRP coined as FCM-ACO for WSN. The deployed nodes are partitioned into fixed clusters by the base station (BS) using Fuzzy C Means (FCM). The cluster heads (CH's) are locally selected from clusters based on residual energy and proximity to BS. Data flows from non cluster head nodes (non-CH) to their respective CH and is aggregated by the latter. An upper chain consisting of the CH's is constructed by BS using ant colony optimization (ACO) along with the selection of a super leader (SL). Data flows along the upper chain being fused at every node except the terminal ones to the SL which transmits directly to BS. We have done extensive Matlab simulations and results indicate FCM-ACO extends WSN lifetime in comparison to LEACH, LEACH-C, PEGASIS and DFCP.

Designing energy efficient multitasking clustering protocols for data collection and supporting event based applications in various environments is the main goal for the researchers.

Routing a packet from a sender to a receiver in an adhoc wireless sensor network, in which the nodes are open to move arbitrarily and organize themselves. Here we discovered a correct path for transmission of data according to route discovery problem. The main thing of the challenge is that in these types of networks there are no base stations so that the nodes themselves performs also functions such as switches and forwarding information to their receiver while coping with the dynamically changing network topology. A route between the sender and the receiver is available as soon as possible because each node contains routing tables which provide the information about the next node on the route. Routing table's management requires that every node to exchange routing tables with its neighborhood whenever a topology changed is identified then re-generates the routes based on the updated information. Different Protocols are define in which a route-discovery phase follow the transmission of a data. In addition to incurring delay due to the route discovery process there is no assurance that the route discovered is functional because of node mobility. In these protocols, the information on the route between sender and receiver is provided in terms of the network topology that means the route is provided by as a sequence of nodes.

The sensor nodes are forming the small network in which the one or more sender is sending data to one destination/s through intermediate nodes or sending information to Base Station (BS). The information collect by base station is further analyzed. The nodes are also static or mobile depends on the situation or conditions. The connection establishment and data sending is possible through routing protocols of WSN. The routing protocols of WSN are not same as traditional wireless routing protocols. One major issue on this network is security. The routing protocols are sending information to destination from particular source and the routing strategy is provides the better way of delivery in the network. The sensor nodes in network are performing through limited battery supply called node energy or power. The attacker are also affected the limited energy resource. In this paper the center of consideration is on the security issues related to WSN routing protocols. The routing in WSN remains a key issue because of that without accurately functioning of routing protocols, the network cleanly will not work the technique it's intended to. Unfortunately, routing also one of the most difficult to protect against attacks malicious activities because of the administration in WSN. The better protection scheme is provides the complete security from attacks and the secure routing is provides the better and trustful network performance. © 2016 IEEE.",Attack; Malicious activities; Routing; Security; Survey; WSN,Base stations; Energy resources; Internet protocols; Network routing; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Surveying; Surveys; Wireless sensor networks; Attack; Limited energy resource; Malicious activities; Protection schemes; Routing; Security; Wireless routing protocols; Wsn routing protocols; Network security,,Sheikh R.Mishra D.K.Jain S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In WMSNs, it is necessary to provide coverage of events occurring in the monitored region for longer durations of time. The Camera Sensor (CS) nodes provide the coverage of an event and transmit the video data to the Base Station (BS), when these nodes are actuated by the associated SS nodes on occurring of an event. Therefore, in the existing pieces of work, distributed actuation focuses on the coverage of an event and prolongation of the lifetime of the CS nodes. However, for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, the SS nodes play a vital role. When the data sent by the associated SS nodes in an event area exceed the preconfigured threshold, the CS nodes start sensing the event and send the video data to the BS. Therefore, in addition to the lifetime of the CS nodes, the lifetime of the SS nodes and their data reporting latencies are important aspects for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, while sending both the video and scalar data to the BS. In this work, we propose a topology management-based distributed camera actuation scheme, named TADA, to prolong the lifetime of SS nodes, and decrease the data reporting latency in event area only. The increased lifetime of the SS nodes, in turn, increases the event coverage and packet delivery ratio. To increase the lifetime of the SS nodes in an event area, the SS nodes with the most residual energies are selected as the packet aggregators. In addition, the transmission range of these nodes is decreased, and in-network packet aggregation is performed, while reporting the happening of an event to the associated CS nodes. The aggregator selection mechanism helps in balancing energy consumption of the SS nodes. Similarly, the decrease in transmission range and aggregation mechanism help in decreasing energy consumption of these nodes. The transmission range of the SS nodes is decreased using social network analysis and Coalition Formation Game (CFG). CFG also helps in decreasing the data reporting latency of an event by the SS nodes to their associated CS nodes. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme, TADA, which is based on the distributed topology management protocol named T-Must, achieves high performance in terms of the lifetime of the SS nodes, data reporting latency, coverage ratio of the event, event reporting credibility index, and packet delivery ratio in an environment affected by shadow fading. © 2017 ACM.","C.2.2 [computer-communication networks]: network protocols-topology control, in-network packet aggregation, medium access control; Coalition formation game; Design; In-network packet aggregation; Performance; Radio interference; Social network analysis; Wireless multimedia sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks",Access control; Cameras; Computer games; Design; Energy utilization; Fading (radio); Medium access control; Network protocols; Radio interference; Social networking (online); Topology; Video recording; Wireless sensor networks; Coalition formation games; In networks; Performance; Topology control; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Sensor nodes,,,Association for Computing Machinery,15564665,,,,English,ACM Trans.

In this context, this work introduces and addresses some aspects of a fundamental question: can a spatial field be estimated from samples taken at unknown sampling locations? In a field (signal) sampling setup, unknown sampling locations, sample quantization, unknown bandwidth of the field, and presence of measurement-noise present difficulties in the process of field estimation. In this work, except for quantization, the other three issues will be tackled together in a mobile-sampling framework. Spatially bandlimited fields are considered. It is assumed that measurement-noise affected field samples are collected on spatial locations obtained from an unknown renewal process. That is, the samples are obtained on locations obtained from a renewal process, but the sampling locations and the renewal process distribution are unknown. In this challenging unknown sampling location setup, it is shown that the mean-squared error in field estimation decreases as O(1/n) where n is the average number of samples collected by the mobile sensor. The average number of samples collected is determined by the inter-sample spacing distribution in the renewal process. An algorithm to ascertain spatial field's bandwidth is detailed, which works with high probability as the average number of samples n increases. This algorithm works in the same setup, i.e., in the presence of measurement-noise and unknown sampling locations. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Additive white noise; nonuniform sampling; signal reconstruction; signal sampling; wireless sensor networks,Bandwidth; Location; Mean square error; Quantization (signal); Signal reconstruction; Spurious signal noise; White noise; Wireless sensor networks; Additive white noise; Bandlimited fields; Field estimations; Mean squared error; Measurement Noise; Nonuniform sampling; Presence of measurement noise; Spacing distribution; Signal sampling,"Kumar, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: animesh@ee.iitb.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,189448,,IETTA,,English,IEEE Trans.

In a cluster based routing approach, cluster heads (CHs) cooperate with each other to forward their data to the base station (BS) via multi-hop routing. In this process, CHs closer to the BS are burdened with heavier relay traffic and tend to die prematurely which causes network partition is popularly known as a hot spot problem. To mitigate the hot spot problem, in this paper, we propose unequal clustering and routing algorithms based on novel chemical reaction optimization (nCRO) paradigm, we jointly call these algorithms as novel CRO based unequal clustering and routing algorithms (nCRO-UCRA). In clustering, we partition the network into unequal clusters such that smaller size clusters near to the sink and larger size clusters relatively far away from the sink. For this purpose, we develop the CH selection algorithm based on nCRO paradigm and assign the non-cluster head sensor nodes to the CHs based on derived cost function. Then, a routing algorithm is presented which is also based on nCRO based approach. All these algorithms are developed with the efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and novel potential energy functions. The nCRO-UCRA is simulated extensively on various scenarios of WSNs and varying number of sensors and the CHs. The results are compared with some existing algorithms and original CRO based algorithm called as CRO-UCRA to show the superiority in terms of various performance metrics like residual energy, network lifetime, number of alive nodes, data packets received by the BS and convergence rate. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Chemical reaction optimization; Clustering; Hot spot problem; Routing; Wireless sensor network,Algorithms; Chemical reactions; Cost functions; Network routing; Optimization; Potential energy; Potential energy functions; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Chemical-reaction optimizations; Cluster-based routing; Clustering; Hot spot problem; Performance metrics; Routing; Selection algorithm; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Clustering algorithms,"Srinivasa Rao, P.C.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: pasupuleti.vasu@yahoo.in",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954318315

Due to high resilience to the attacks, the pairwise key distribution schemes are highly preferred than other schemes. However, due to the resource constraints on the nodes and the threat of node capture, pairwise key establishment in the sensor networks is a challenging task. The security performance of these schemes decreases with the increase in the number of compromised nodes. To overcome these issues, a Polynomial and Multivariate Mapping-Based Triple-Key (PMMTK) distribution approach is proposed in this paper. It involves calculation of individual key of the nodes and common triple-key.

Based on this node distribution, a distributed, nearly load-balanced data gathering algorithm is developed to deliver packets to the sink node via minimum-hop paths that also in turn helps to limit the network traffic. An average case probabilistic analysis is done based on perfect matching of random bipartite graphs to establish a theoretical lower bound on the number of nodes to be deployed.

Diverse paradigm of Computational intelligence (CI) including Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), Reinforcement learning (RL), Artificial immune systems (AIS), and more recently, Artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic have been used for energy efficient clustering in WSNs. Due to ease of use and adaptive nature, ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs. However, its search equation, which is comparably poor at exploitation and require storage of certain control parameters, contributes to its insufficiency. Thus, we present an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve its exploitation capabilities. Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student?s?t distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Student?s?t distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherit the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads (CHs) and improve energy efficiency in WSNs. Simulation results shows that the proposed clustering protocol outperforms other well known protocols on the basis of packet delivery, throughput, energy consumption, network lifetime and latency as performance metric. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Energy efficient clustering; Improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic; Wireless sensor networks,Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet protocols; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Artificial Immune System; Energy Efficient clustering; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Exploration and exploitation; Metaheuristic; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Energy efficiency,"Singh Mann, P.; Research Scholar, I K Gujral Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: psmaan@hotmail.com",,Academic Press,10848045,,,,English,J Network Comput Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012247176

The reliable delivery is only possible when the routing protocols are efficient and secure. Because of lack of resources it is not possible to use existing cryptosystems to provide security in WSN. But, trust aware routing can provide the security with lesser resources, which become popular in last three to four years. In this paper, a new energy efficient and trust aware reliable opportunistic routing (TAEROR) protocol is proposed. The protocol consists of a trust metric and also a relay selection algorithm. The trust aware metric detects the malicious nodes on the basis of forwarding sincerity, energy consumption and acknowledgement sincerity. Relay selection algorithms avoid these malicious nodes to get selected in the routing process. The protocol is simulated and compared to existing trust aware routing protocols.

With the increase in wiring cables connecting these devices, the weight of a vehicle increases significantly and degrades the fuel efficiency during driving. In order to reduce the wiring weight, wireless communication has been introduced to replace wiring cables between some devices. However, the extra energy consumption and the transmission delay due to wireless communication need to be considered because they may result in frequent maintenance (e.g., recharging of batteries) and deadline violation, respectively.

Sensor nodes sense the environment periodically and forward the collected data to a sink. In a single sink WSNs, nodes closer to the sink become overburdened for relaying excessive data. This may incur faster energy consumption by nodes and lead an energy hole around the sink. As a result, the network lifetime is shortened. Multiple sinks mitigate this problem, reduce energy consumption at nodes and prolong the network lifetime by distributing the traffic over multiple sinks. This paper focuses on multiple sink placement problem and proposes two local search technique based energy aware multiple sink placement strategies for WSNs. The lifetime oriented approach based sink placement takes into account the lifetime of nodes and places the sinks at suitable locations such that the average network lifetime is increased. While the energy oriented approach focuses on minimizing the average energy consumption of the network. We evaluate the performance of both the strategies via simulations and compare them with random sink placement strategy. Simulation results highlight that the lifetime oriented approach improves the lifetime significantly. © 2017 IEEE.",average energy consumption; average network lifetime; communication tree; grouping; multiple sinks; Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Average energy; grouping; Local search techniques; Multiple sinks; Network lifetime; Placement problems; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The paper introduces an algorithm for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks. It aims to conserve the battery power of sensors to be utilized for synchronization among the nodes in the network. The proposed synchronization approach is topology driven. In the existing literature, a wide range of protocols use flooding as the basic mechanism to create a topology. However, our method is based on the clustering of nodes with minimum hop distance from the cluster head and the chaining of cluster heads in order to create an energy-efficient topology. Also, it results in substantial reduction in the total transmission overhead. Further, it restricts the energy consumption in synchronizing the nodes of the network. Moreover, the approach avoids the loss of network coverage by electing a new cluster head in the event of cluster head failure. Finally, the simulation results exhibits that the proposed approach has significant energy savings as compared to many popular algorithms. © 2017 ACM.",Chaining; Clustering; Energy-efficiency; Synchronization,Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Synchronization; Topology; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Chaining; Clustering; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy efficient topologies; Network coverage; Substantial reduction; Time synchronization; Total transmission; Energy efficiency,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

It is the need of hour to monitor air quality in order to reduce air pollution. Exposure to air pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which is estimated to be the cause for 620,000 early deaths in 2010, and the impact on health due to air pollution in India has been calculated at 3 percent of its GDP. In recent years, air pollution has acquired critical dimensions and the air quality in most cities that monitor outdoor air pollution fail to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels. Air pollution is a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings which need to be controlled. With the advancements in technology, several innovations have been made in the field of communications that are transitioning to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this domain, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are one of those independent sensing devices to monitor physical and environmental conditions along with thousands of applications in other fields. In this paper, we are proposing the deployment of WSN sensor nodes in public transport buses for the constant monitoring of air pollution. The data regarding the air pollution particles such as emissions, smoke, and other pollutants will be collected via sensors on the public transport bus and the data will be aggregated and transmitted to the nearest sink node. Using the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) the collected data will be uploaded on the cloud server also called as the IoT cloud where a large amount of the data is stored.

Quantum inspired algorithms are capable of providing competitive solutions even with a very small population size which results in reduced computational cost as population size is a factor in complexity calculation for evolutionary and swarm algorithms. The effectiveness of proposed approach has been evaluated by comparing it with traditional genetic algorithm based clustering for wireless sensor networks. Simulation results clearly indicate that quantum inspired genetic algorithm is capable of performing clustering in more efficient way and increasing the network lifetime as compared to traditional genetic algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.",Energy balancing; Multi-hop routing; Quantum inspired genetic algorithm; Unequal clustering; Wireless sensor networks,Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Population statistics; Quantum computers; Reusability; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering in wireless sensor networks; Complexity calculation; Effective mechanisms; Energy-balancing; Multi-hop routing; Quantum inspired genetic algorithm; Traditional genetic algorithms; Unequal clustering; Clustering algorithms,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Each sensor node has very low battery life. Sensor nodes have finite storage capabilities, transmission and processing range and energy resources are also limited. There are many design issues in WSNs such as mobility, energy consumption, network topology, data aggregation, localization, production cost, security, network size and density etc. Routing protocols provide efficient working of the network, increase network lifetime, responsible for maintaining the routes in the network and perform reliable multi-hop communication under various conditions. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Protocol) is one of the hierarchical protocol in WSNs. LEACH uses TDMA MAC Protocol. During random data distribution, a number of TDMA slots are wasted. Because sensor nodes don't know either they have data to send or not, they continuously listen to the medium and this result in idle listening problem. This paper proposed OE-LEACH (An Optimized Energy Efficient LEACH Algorithm for WSNs) to enhance the performance of the LEACH Protocol, reduce time delay and energy consumption. Network Lifetime and throughput of WSN also increases.

The way of data collection can be automatic or manual. Adversity is the main cause that in many systems, manual intervention is not possible. So, opting for automated way isn't such bad idea. Depending upon the way of communication, wired or wireless, data can be collected through either wired or wireless networks. Wired networks have some limitations when considered for flexibility, mobility, etc. In this regard, wireless networks are more advantageous as they have better compatibility, they are flexible and are growing in demand. Wireless sensor networks, use smart sensors which act in collaborative manner to accomplish the given task. Wireless Sensor Actor Networks (WSANs) form a topology and if there is any failure occurring, topology repair algorithms act as recovery tool. This paper presents idea of preventing a node from failure by applying cluster head rotation methodology (K-means Algorithm) and if failure happens then the recovery schemes like Distributed Actor Recovery Algorithm (DARA) and Least Disruptive topology Repair (LeDiR) algorithm will act as a tool to recovery. The objective is to maintain the topology almost identical to pre-failure state of the network.

These opportunities have initiated many research proposals under healthcare domain. Due to its widespread requirement, sensor technology has subset into a category called Wireless Body Area Network (WBANs). These applications are devised to take care of emergency requirements to help the person to handle emergency health issue. To overcome this research problem, many research studies are going on and some already presented. Medium Access Control (MAC) for emergency handling, recently proposed Extended Period and Mixed Period (MPEP) approach overcome the problems associated with 802.15.4 protocol. The MPEP approach is based on superframe structured MAC protocols by considering the contention free period (CFP) allocations. However the problem with this method is inefficient slot allocation technique which may leads to delay in emergency handling in WBAN. To overcome this problem, in this paper MPEP is extended by adding the preemptive slot allocation method for improving the performance of slot allocation and hence emergency handling in WBAN, which is termed as Hybrid MPEP (HMPEP).

The Cluster Head (CH) usually performs data fusion, aggregation and communication of the aggregated data to the Base Station. As the CHs communicate with the Base Stations located at larger distances than the member nodes, they generally consume more energy. This leads to energy drainage of CHs at a faster rate than the member nodes. This is overcome by re-electing new CHs at periodic intervals to balance the energy consumption among all the nodes in the network. Many CH reselection techniques based on various factors are proposed in the literature. Yet, experimentally these proposals are not validated. Hence, to validate the basis of CH selection, experiments using ZigBee motes is conducted in real time. Experiments are carried out by choosing nodes at different positions from the base Station as CH. The Inter and Intra energy consumption is calculated and presented. The experimental studies reveal that the centroid or close to centroid is the optimal position of the CH. Thus the optimal location of CH helps in minimizing the energy consumption which in turn increases the lifetime of the network. © 2016 IEEE.",cluster head selection; clustering; Energy consumption; network lifetime; Wireless Sensor Networks,Base stations; Data fusion; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Zigbee; Aggregated datum; Cluster-head selections; clustering; Faster rates; Network energy consumption; Network lifetime; Optimal locations; Optimal position; Wireless sensor networks,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Sensor nodes in WSNare connected to each other by networks, mainly powered by a battery source. These sensor nodes have lesser amount of power and computational capabilities. Typically, sensor nodes are deployed in remote areas where replacement of their batteries once exhausted becomes extremely difficult and cumbersome. Battery power is crucial aspect of the network (while designing a protocol). To maximize the lifespan of sensor nodes we recommend a genetic algorithm-based model. In this model, energy is distributed among all the sensor nodes and network performance is enriched by choosing the cluster head and clustering on the basis of 3 important factors: a. residual energy, b. distance from the sink and c. trust of the node. The trust of the node helps to detect malicious (abnormal) nodes in the neighborhood. To further maximize the network lifetime, the proposed model implements a multihop routing mechanism for data dissemination from source to the sink.

In case of accident, there will be some collision in the vehicle which will be sensed by the sensors. The crash sensors will measure and report the intensity of collision based on certain parameters and operations related to the automotive design of the vehicle. This strength of collision mapped on a scale will then inform the respective nearby sensors in IoT which can come out to help the victims. In case of lighter collision, only the local car repairs and other nearby sensors forming an IoT network will be informed.

These sensor nodes needs the power or energy to operate which is generally provided by battery. since these batteries have limited amount of energy so energy consumption in sensor network is a serious issue. It is desirable to design a protocol in WSN which reduces the energy consumption so to enhance the network lifetime. In this work, an energy efficient protocol is designed using Discrete Binary Particle Swarm Optimization which enhances the network lifetime without degrading network performance. In this work weighted sum approach is use to convert multiobjective optimization problem into a single objective optimization problem. Three parameters residual energy of sensor nodes, load mismatch in clusters and distance from CH to BS is taken into account in order to meet the objective.

It connects objects such as smart phones, sensors, LED(Light Emitting Diodes) displays and even clothes through the internet allowing them to interact and exchange information among themselves. In today's times IoT has found its application in practically every walk of life and inventory management is no exception. At present, inventory management is becoming increasingly complex, where there is an exponential rise in the diversity and number of both products and customers. The biggest problem faced by store owners is to optimize the experience of inventory management along with increased sales and reduced operational costs. With such enormous product lines it becomes extremely difficult for store owners to track and monitor the performance of a product in terms of its sales, shelf life, cost and customer response. IoT acts as a solution to this problem as it facilitates the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in order to interconnect all the various actors in a logistic system. This humongous network of interconnected devices generate massive amounts of data which is difficult to store and process. Cloud computing here plays a role of a facilitator and provides great help in addressing challenges related to storage and processing capabilities.

This data can be of any type but it must consists the identity of that particular node where this data actually exist. The identity of that particular node is also as much important as the data. Due to this, there can be some security issues because if the identity of that particular node leaked out then any fake node can act as the original one and data will start transferring between that fake node and cluster heads (CH). Many attacks like Man-in-The-middle and DoS (Denial of Service) lead to the whole network in sink. Therefor there is the need to validate the node which is going to deal with any CH or any node that is it the original one or fake.

Main research issues in designing a protocol for WSNs is, how to minimize energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime, while ensuring the required coverage as well as connectivity. In this paper, we present a coverage and connectivity aware data gathering protocol to provide sufficient coverage and connectivity in the network. The proposed protocol reduces the energy consumption of a network using a sleep scheduling scheme to periodically turn on and off the communication radios. A backbone of relay nodes and independent nodes is maintained for ensuring the connectivity in the network and this is also periodically rebuild the backbone setup. Each node transmits its sensory data to its closest independent node and an independent node forwards the sensed data via relay nodes toward the sink. The proposed protocol does not use any geographic information and is a fully distributed. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol consumes less energy consumption compare to existing protocol and also prolong the network life time, while maintaining connectivity and coverage. © 2016 IEEE.",Backbone network; Independent node; relay node; sleep scheduling; WSNs,Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Scheduling; Wireless sensor networks; Back-bone network; Independent node; Relay node; Sleep scheduling; WSNs; Sensor nodes,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The major approaches for target localization & tracking in a defined WSN are Range Based, Range Free, Prediction Filter based Approaches aimed at achieving either Localization & Tracking accuracy or Energy Efficiency or Security or combination of these depending upon application at hand. Besides other range based techniques (TOA, TDOA, AOA) aimed at localization/tracking, RSSI-based approach is most widely used in spite of various challenges associated with it. The most important reason is that it does not need the extra hardware as most of electronic gadgets have built-in RSSI Circuitry to read RSS. By exploiting this RSSI measurement, one can find distance between transmitter & receiver using a suitable mathematical model of signal attenuation. However due to high dynamicity of wireless environment, the RSSI measurements are notoriously unpredictable.

The primary task of WSN is to gather field data and route it to the BS for analysis. They are generally deployed in harsh localities where battery replacement is not possible advocating the need for energy efficient data gathering to elongate network lifetime. In cluster based hierarchical routing protocols (HRP's) the energy intensive task of being a cluster head are performed by a subset of deployed nodes while others are engaged in local communication. The roles of the nodes are interchanged in different rounds for load balancing. In this paper we propose an energy efficient load balanced data gathering protocol coined as RF-LEACH where partitioning is done using rough fuzzy c means (RFCM) and cluster head selection is based on fuzzy logic. Matlab simulation results indicate RF-LEACH performs better than LEACH, Fuzzy LEACH and FCM LEACH in terms of extending network lifetime and throughput in a load balanced way. The results are shown to be statistically significant. © 2016 IEEE.",FCM; Fuzzy logic; HRP; Network lifetime; Rough set; Unequal clustering,Computation theory; Computer circuits; Electric batteries; Fuzzy logic; Leaching; MATLAB; Power management (telecommunication); Rough set theory; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Battery replacements; Cluster-head selections; Data gathering protocols; Hierarchical routing protocol; Local communications; Matlab simulations; Network lifetime; Unequal clustering; Energy efficiency,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The affected nodes behave normally after the resumption of favorable environmental conditions. Therefore, both dumb and transfaulty behaviors of sensor nodes are dynamic in nature. The nodes in these networks get temporarily isolated from the network, when they behave as dumb or transfaulty. Because of the presence of nodes with such behavior, dynamic communication holes may occur in the network, which are formed or removed and thus increase or decrease in size with time. Connectivity re-establishment procedures can mitigate holes by re-connecting isolated nodes with the network after activating the intermediate sleep nodes, adjusting the communication range of intermediate nodes, or by using an alternative communication mode. However, such procedures cannot always re-establish connectivity because of the lack of neighbor nodes in reduced or adjusted communication range. Therefore, routing schemes using greedy forwarding approaches need to bypass holes to avoid the data packets from getting stuck at the boundary nodes and efficiently delivering them to the sink. However, the existing hole avoidance schemes consider holes as static. The proposed scheme, BRIDGE, detects hole boundary and bypasses routing traffics in the dynamic hole scenario. In the proposed scheme, a boundary node selects the next hop based on the minimum distance from all the neighbor nodes to the destination node, although this minimum distance is more than the distance to the destination from the node itself. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme degrades with the increase in hole area. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Coverage and clustering techniques enable the sensor network to operate in group-based and region-based communication and thus save the node energy. Energy-efficient protocols save the node energy and increase the network life cycle in a resource-constrained sensor network. Cluster head (CH) node manages and controls the operations such as network topology, coverage area, and routing paths (multi-paths and fault-tolerant paths) of the network. In this paper, we present deterministic K-means secure coverage clustering (K-SCC) with periodic authentication. The proposed protocol uses coverage clustering technique with periodic authentication between the CH node and sensor nodes to establish the secure channel in the network. Maximum cover of K nodes is maintained in the secure coverage cluster to achieve authenticated communication between the sensor nodes in the network. The proposed K-SCC protocol is compared with the existing protocols such as deterministic-SCC and random-SCC protocols. Simulation results indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol achieves an average of 84% coverage ratio (cluster/sensor node ratio) as compared with 62% coverage ratio in the existing SCC protocols. Simulations also indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol consumes 20% less energy as compared with the existing SCC protocol. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, the authors have developed a new algorithm called, exponential ant colony optimisation (EACO) to route discovery problem in wireless sensor network after finding the cluster heads (CHs) using fractional artificial bee colony (FABC) algorithm. In the first step, CHs are found out using the FABC algorithm with fitness function considering the distance, energy and delay. In the second phase, ACO algorithm is modified with exponential smoothing model for multi-path route discovery. This new algorithm called, EACO found the optimal routes among CHs to transmit a data from any source node to base station with multiple objectives including energy, distance, intra-cluster delay and intercluster delay. These objectives are effectively formulated as new fitness function to find the optimal route path. From the experimentation, the outcome showed that the cumulative energy kept after 2000 round of experiments is 0.2039 for the proposed algorithm but the existing approach (threshold + ACO) kept only 0.0338. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Artificial bee colonies; Cumulative energy; Exponential smoothing model; Fitness functions; Multi path route discoveries; Multiple-objectives; Route discovery; Wireless technologies; Clustering algorithms,"Kumar, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I.K.G.

This paper concentrates on energy reduction in the field of On the node processing. Due to limited energy supply from batteries the node must trade communication for on the node computation. Many of the WSN data processing algorithms use parallel prefix operations as common denominator. Parallel Prefix Operations have the form of Binary Tree Architecture. Binary tree architecture uses more number of Processing Element (PE) s. Parallel Prefix operations using Binary Tree Architecture (BTA) uses more area and more power. Binary Tree Architecture can be modified in to area and power efficient Folded Tree Architecture (FTA).

Wireless Sensor Networks can be employed in various applications ranging from personal health-care, indoor temperature monitoring to military theater. The data from each sensor is required to be collected at the central node for further processing. In spite of special designs and routing protocols for improving efficiency, data can often be delayed or go missing due to node failures. This problem can be overcome by predicting the data beforehand and using the predicted data when there is a delay in the arrival of the data or when the data goes missing. The prediction of such data is a very challenging problem.

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is one such technology that is improving the quality of health care. WBAN has personal patient data. Attackers can access this data from Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) or from the wireless channel between nodes and server; this requires efficient security protocol for providing data security. In case of emergency, the vital parameters should be easily accessed by the doctor's or the paramedic. Stringent authentication and security criteria's makes it difficult to access the data during emergency, which may prove to be disastrous for the patient. This paper proposes a new approach for data security in wireless channel specifically during emergency conditions. WBAN uses Advanced Encryption Standard-128 (AES-128) cipher which requires substantial time for encryption which may be fatal in case of emergencies. Security mechanism for sensor nodes should be lightweight due to the area and resource constraints. The proposed method uses chaos based scrambling in case of emergency, which is lightweight with respect to AES and also requires very less processing time which is desired in emergencies. © 2016 IEEE.",Advanced Encryption standard (AES); chaotic scrambling; cryptography; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),Data privacy; Electrocardiography; Health care; Hospital data processing; Sensor nodes; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Advanced Encryption Standard; chaotic scrambling; Emergency conditions; Quality of health care; Resource Constraint; Wireless body area network; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor node; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Stud.

The sink will recover the final aggregate with just t shares using CRT. The multi-objective of the proposed technique is to provide data privacy, identity privacy, source location privacy, and route privacy. The solution also mitigates the problem of packet losses associated with the unreliable wireless communication medium by improving the reliability.

The major novelty of the paper is the two proposed algorithms through which the number of platoons and platoon heads (PH) are decided upon for increasing the network lifetime. Algorithm-1 analyze the distribution of nodes and forms a set of possible minimum number of platoons (clusters) having equal number nodes, based on Hierarchical clustering technique. The algorithm-2 partitions the given network into platoons and selects the platoon head (PH) based on coverage range of wireless node. It uses SPSS statistical software tool for platoon decomposition and also to determine the platoon head (PH). The number of iterations required for selection of PH is found to be minimum, irrespective of the number of network nodes. The platoon is controlled by its platoon head (PH) and the data transfer happens locally between the platoon nodes and its head. The platoon head alone communicates with the road side unit (RSU) and avoids multiple data link between the individual nodes of platoon to RSU. The performance of SNAP algorithm has been verified using NS-2 network simulator and found to consume less transmission energy, increased node and network lifetime which in turn increase the overall efficiency of the network. © 2016, ISAROB.",Intelligent transport system; Node clustering; Road-side unit; Vehicular ad hoc network; Wireless sensor network,Ad hoc networks; Clustering algorithms; Data transfer; Intelligent systems; Roads and streets; Sensor nodes; Traffic control; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based routing; Hier-archical clustering; Intelligent transport systems; Node clustering; Number of iterations; Overall efficiency; Statistical software tools; Transmission energy; Vehicular ad hoc networks,"Prakash, R.; Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: prakash.rs295@gmail.com",,Springer Tokyo,14335298,,,,English,Artif.

This information is sent to base station (BS), where, it is processed and analyzed by the underlying application. Functioning of WSN highly depend on the deployment strategy and the coordination among the sensor nodes. Preserving the energy is an important goal that must be considered when developing a routing protocol for WSNs. Radio communication in sensor nodes is highly expensive operation in terms of energy usage. Energy can be conserved in an efficient way with specifically customized routing techniques. Data aggregation methods when applied to sensor nodes, clusters are created where data generated from cluster members is aggregated. This kind of data collection strategy results into energy efficient communication. Integration of data aggregation and clustering approach is enabled through customized hierarchical routing strategies. Clustering technique is key to apply and exploit, the advantages in-network data processing offers. This paper compares various clustering protocols like LEACHC, K-means and its variants. The protocols are compared with respect to network lifetime, data delivery and energy consumption. These protocols only consider intra cluster distance of members while doing clustering, due to this non-uniform clusters are created. These kind of clusters do not deliver data periodically and uniformly from every corner of the field. A density control based approach is proposed which does balancing of cluster members assignment in a loose way. A loose density control (LDC) based approach is integrated with K-means clustering method. LDC based approach exhibits improved average data delivery per node, ensuring regular data availability from every corner of the deployment area as long as the nodes are alive. Not only it improves the amount of data delivered, it also improves the network lifetime considerably. This performance improvement is achieved with almost similar energy expenditure compared to other protocols. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Clustering protocol; Clustering techniques; Controlled clustering; Data collection strategies; Energy efficient communications; Hierarchical routings; In-network data processing; K-means clustering method; Wireless sensor networks,"Raval, G.; CSE Department, Institute of Technology, Nirma UniversityIndia; email: gaurang.raval@nirmauni.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,9467076,,,,English,Microsyst Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973167531

Existing cloud pricing models are limited in terms of the homogeneity in service-types, and hence, are not compliant for the heterogeneous service oriented architecture of Se-aaS. We propose a new pricing model comprising of two components, applicable for Se-aaS architecture: pricing attributed to Hardware (pH) and pricing attributed to Infrastructure (pI). pH addresses the problem of pricing the physical sensor nodes subject to variable demand and utility of the end-users. It maximizes the profit incurred by every sensor owner, while keeping in mind the end-users' utility. pI mainly focuses on the pricing incurred due to the virtualization of resources. It takes into account the cost for the usage of the infrastructural resources, inclusive of the cost for maintaining virtualization within sensor-cloud. pI maximizes the profit of the sensor-cloud service provider (SCSP) by considering the user satisfaction. Simulation results depict improved performance of pH in comparison to the traditional hardware pricing algorithms, viz. PPM and Sprite, in terms of the residual energy, proximity to the base station (BS), received signal strength (RSS), overhead, and cumulative energy consumption. The results also show the tendency of the sensor-owners to converge to the end-user utility, but not exceed it. We also analyze the performance of pI.

The proposed multi-constraint, multi-objective routing optimization approach under strict resource constraints guarantees reliability and fast data delivery along with efficient power management in spite of unreliable wireless links and limited power supply. In query driven applications, the request from the sink to the individual sensor node will be a broadcast message, whereas the individual sensor nodes replies back to sink as unicast messages. In the proposed work, the fuzzy approach and A Star algorithm are utilized for satisfying energy and bandwidth constraints to route the broadcast messages of the sink while querying all the sensor nodes in the network. Every node will be provided with a guidance list, which is used to decide the next best neighbor node with good route quality for forwarding the received multi-hop broadcast messages. The route quality of the every node is estimated with fuzzy rules based on the network parameters such as maximum remaining energy, minimum traffic load and better link quality to increase the network lifetime. The provision of overhearing the broadcast messages and acknowledgements within the transmission range minimizes the effort to search for the active time of nodes while routing the broadcast messages with asynchronous scheduling. Further, in the proposed work only the time slot of its nearest neighbor relay node (to which packets are to be forwarded) is learnt to reduce the number of message transmissions in the network. For the unicast message replies, the fuzzy membership function is modified and devised based on the routing metrics such as higher residual energy, minimum traffic loads and minimum hop count under energy and bandwidth constraints. Also, the multi-hop heuristic routing algorithm called Nearest Neighbor Tree is effectively used to reduce the number of neighbors in the guidance list that are elected for forwarding. This helps to increase the individual sensor node's lifetime, thereby maximizes the network lifetime and guarantees increased network throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed technique reduces repeated transmissions, decreases the number of transmissions, shortens the active time of the sensor nodes and increases the network lifetime for query driven sensor network applications invariant to total the number of sensor nodes and sinks in the network. The proposed algorithm is tested in a small test bed of sensor network with ten nodes that monitors the room temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Bandwidth efficient; Distributed algorithm; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetime; Multi-hop routing; Wireless sensor network,Bandwidth; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy inference; Information management; Membership functions; Network routing; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Power management; Sensor nodes; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Bandwidth efficient; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetimes; Multi-hop routing; Power management (telecommunication),"Kavi Priya, S.; Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College (Autonomous)India; email: urskavi@mepcoeng.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

Such failures can result in a disconnection in part of the network and the sensed data being unable to obtain a route to the sink(s), i.e. a network failure. Network failures potentially degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It is very difficult to monitor network failures using a manual operator in a harsh or hostile environment. In such environments, communication links can easy fail because of node unequal energy depletion and hardware failure or invasion. Thus it is desirable that deployed sensor nodes are capable of overcoming network failures. In this paper, we consider the problem of tolerating network failures seen by deployed sensor nodes in a WSN. We first propose a novel clustering algorithm for WSNs, termed Distributed Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Clustering (DEEHC) that selects cluster heads according to the residual energy of deployed sensor nodes with the aid of a secondary timer. During the clustering phase, each sensor node finds k-vertex disjoint paths to cluster heads depending on the energy level of its neighbor sensor nodes. We then present a k-Vertex Disjoint Path Routing (kVDPR) algorithm where each cluster head finds k-vertex disjoint paths to the base station and relays their aggregate data to the base station. Furthermore, we also propose a novel Route Maintenance Mechanism (RMM) that can repair k-vertex disjoint paths throughout the monitoring session. The resulting WSNs become tolerant to k-1 failures in the worst case. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested using various network scenarios and compared to the existing state of the art approaches to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2016",Fault and link failures; Network failure; Wireless sensor network,Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Electric fault currents; Energy efficiency; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Repair; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication links; Distributed routing algorithm; Environmental hazards; Hostile environments; Link failures; Network failure; State-of-the-art approach; Vertex disjoint paths; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Chanak, P.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: prasenjit.chanak@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,15708705,,,,English,Ad Hoc Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008406292

The doctor can get the patients physiological data collected by special sensors deployed on or in the patients body in real time with the mobile devices via the wireless communication channel. The collected data are important and should be confidential. So security measures are considered in the process of communication. Recently, He et al.

Though usual opportunistic coordination adds reliability to TBF, it also increases delay and coordination complexity. Alternatively, this work proposes the use of multiple cooperative relays within every single hop of a trajectory so that two adjacent forwarders do not communicate directly. While minimizing energy consumption further, this novel arrangement ensures an upper bound on delay, which is essential for delay-sensitive mission-critical WSNs.

In this paper, we have evaluated the most commonly used routing protocols in MANET and compared the performance of reactive routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and proactive routing protocols such as Geographic Routing Protocol (GRP), and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol by using OPNET simulator 17.5. The OPNET simulator is optimal for core level network design and parameters of sensor nodes are detailed enough to design a sensor network as the MANET in this paper. Analysis of the performance of protocols are certainly depending on End to End delay (average), Network Load and the throughput. These parameters are the common primary issues behind routing and sensor nodes in the MANET will coordinate themselves following these issues staying in an environment of proactive or reactive routing.

Mobile sinks are used to reduce the number of hops the data travels and thereby reducing the overall energy consumption. In this paper we propose Data Aggregation using Mobile Sink (DAMS) protocol that allows the mobile sink to collect data from WSNs where path of the mobile sink is not known apriori. The mobile sink halts at a point in the network and broadcasts an aggregate query. The average path length of a data packet is a constant in DAMS and hence it can withstand node failures. The performance analysis shows that DAMS incurs less energy consumption and improved packet delivery ratio in comparison to SinkTrail [1]. © 2017 ACM.,Aggregate query; Data gathering and aggregation; Mobile sink; Routing; WSNs,Broadband networks; Dams; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Aggregate queries; Data gathering; Mobile sinks; Routing; WSNs; Wireless sensor networks,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Among many applications target tracking application requires sensor nodes to be localized with minor error. To maintain the target tracking in timely fashion with accurate measurement of target movement is difficult as it summed up with many noises during the detection. Possibilities of node failure often come across in the tracking which results in loss of tracking. Thus to overcome difficulties of tracking new improved tracking framework called as Face (Polygons) Track is proposed. In Face Track sensors are deployed in polygonal fashion. Where polygon share common edge with non overlapping pattern these polygons are the faces and edges being reconstructed to generate each face further so as to avoid loss of tracking. In Face track with Kalman filter, KF optimally selects node as target moves ahead crossing the edges of the face. The Face track network is mapped to develop the courier management system. In this courier management, optimal node selection function selects the number of nodes between source and destination on basis of distance calculated between these node so as to refer nearest node. © 2016 IEEE.",courier management; face track; Kalman filter; optimal node selection; wireless sensor network,Bandpass filters; Clutter (information theory); Geometry; Kalman filters; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Accurate measurement; face track; Management service; Management systems; Node selection; Non-overlapping patterns; Target movements; Wireless sensor communication; Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The DNs can either be connected to a fusion center (referred to as centralized data processing; CDP) or process data independently and communicate with each other via a rate-limited link (referred to as distributed data processing; DDP). In the first stage of this two-stage cophasing scheme, sensors estimate the channel to the DNs using pilot symbols transmitted by the latter; following which they simultaneously transmit multiple streams of data symbols by prerotating them according to the estimated channel phases to the different DNs. The achievable rates for both CDP and DDP are derived to quantify the gains obtainable by the multistream DCP. In order to aid data detection at the receiver, we propose a least-squares-based iterative algorithm for blind channel estimation in CDP-DCP. Following this, we develop a message passing based blind channel estimation algorithm for DDP-DCP. It is found using Monte Carlo simulations that for the CDP system, the proposed blind channel estimation algorithm achieves a probability of error performance very close to that with perfect CSI at the DNs, while using only a moderate number of unknown data symbols for channel estimation. We also derive approximate expressions for the error probability performance of the proposed system for both CDP and DDP and validate their accuracy using Monte Carlo simulations. © 2016 IEEE.",blind channel estimation; data fusion; Distributed co-phasing; Distributed data detection; message passing; MIMO,Blind equalization; Data fusion; Data handling; Intelligent systems; Internet protocols; Iterative methods; Message passing; MIMO systems; Monte Carlo methods; Network layers; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Approximate expressions; Blind channel estimation; Co-phasing; Distributed data; Distributed data processing; Error probability performance; Multiple destinations; Probability of errors; Channel estimation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1053587X,,ITPRE,,English,IEEE Trans Signal Process,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012932506

Due to their energy constraint issues, many routing algorithms have been developed for efficient forwarding of data for minimizing energy consumption. Considering the static sink, nodes near the sink will have more load for routing data, therefore sink has been made as mobile. Now the sink can itself moves to the sensor node or leader node for collecting data as sink can be charged with high energy. Moreover sensor nodes deployed in battlefields, hills and similar risky areas are difficult to monitor for their energy issues. So the concept of grid arises. Now the sensor network can be constructed as logical grids of uniform size and data aggregation can be done using energy efficient routing. The proposed algorithm is an enhanced form of VGDRA algorithm which is grid based routing algorithm but lacks the concept of estimating energy on the basis of distance. In the proposed algorithm, sensor network is divided into logical grids of k-cells and a Cell Header (CH) is elected among each cell that acts as leader to cluster. The algorithm proves to be efficient in terms of energy by minimizing route construction cost considering shortest distance to sink. © 2017 IEEE.",routing etc; virtual grid; Wireless sensor network,Clustering algorithms; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Low power electronics; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Construction costs; Data aggregation; Energy constraint; Energy efficient routing; Grid-based routing; Minimizing energy; routing etc; Virtual grids; Energy efficiency,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

But this adversely has drawback of increasing the population of older class of people who require much more sophisticated environment. In order to overcome this problem the Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) are used. A WBSN is a system which plays critical role in managing health issues of aged population group, busy people or the young children who require assistance. The patient cannot be expected to stay at same place for longer duration of time. The patients are assumed to be similar to mobile nodes. To bring about an effective communication between these mobile nodes, there is a need for design of routing protocol suitable for WBSN.

These large data sets are now called Big Data. Working with Big Data is not a common task. As this large data set has information hidden within them, researchers cannot and they have not ignored the large data set. Data mining is an interdisciplinary field in Computer Science which extracts information or the hidden patterns from data. Association rule mining and frequent itemset mining are popular data mining techniques that requires entire data to be in main memory. But large datasets does not fit into main memory. To handle this drawback, Hadoop MapReduce approach is used which has scalability and robustness features to handle large datasets. Apriori, Eclat and FP Growth are well known Frequent Itemset Mining algorithms. These algorithms are revised to work with Big Data using Hadoop MapReduce. But MapReduce framework has problems such as it stores the intermediate data in local disk. So the data needs to be accessed from the local disk which results in high latency problem. To address this issue Spark follows a general execution model that helps in in-memory computing and optimization of arbitrary operator graphs so that querying data becomes much faster when compared to the disk based engines like MapReduce. Thus the paper focuses on enhancing the performance of Frequent Itemset Mining using Apache Spark architecture and study the performance of this Revamped Market Basket Analysis based on FP-Growth by comparing it with Hadoop MapReduce implementation of Frequent Itemset Mining task, BigFIM and also with different datasets. © 2017 IEEE.",Apache Spark; Frequent Itemset Mining; Hadoop MapReduce,Commerce; Data mining; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Remote sensing; Wireless sensor networks; Arbitrary operators; Frequent itemset mining; Hadoop MapReduce; Hidden patterns; Interdisciplinary fields; Mapreduce frameworks; Market basket analysis; Memory computations; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The wireless sensor nodes have been identified in different areas of the campus and the load of different buildings has been monitored. Solar and wind power system controlled by WSN technologies has been also installed to meet the excess load demands. A central control station will monitor the load distribution throughout the campus and hence will make load leveling possible.

These sensors are deployed to accomplish various tasks e.g. to measure the environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity, pollution level of sea water; to monitor some ongoing activities such as surveillance, tracking of suspects; and etc. Also their batteries don't last very long since it requires continues transmission of data towards the user/customer/sink. Our main goal here is how to provide simple and effective approach to provide hybrid data compression (spatial and temporal both) in the wireless sensor network in order to improve energy efficiency of the network. WSNs are deployed in great amount over the detected environment and it has been observed that the data from neighboring sensors usually have large correlation so sometimes it is waste of energy for the transmission of this duplicate information from neighboring sensors rather we can exploit this spatial correlation to reduce the heavy burden of data in transmission. Besides it has been seen that on a particular sensor, their readings are also correlated for a limited duration so we can exploit this temporal correlation to reduce the amount of data. Our scheme is not suitable to real time data monitoring rather it is quite better for delay tolerant services as it requires a little time for processing of data before transmitting it to the sink.

The localization challenge has been posed as a multidimensional global optimization problem in earlier literature. Many swarm intelligence algorithms have been proposed for accurate localization. The untapped vast potential of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has inspired the research presented in this paper. The ABC algorithm has been investigated as a tool for anchor-assisted sensor localization in WSNs. Results of Matlab simulation of ABC-based multistage localization have been presented. Further, the results are compared with those of the localization method based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. A comparison of the performances of ABC and PSO algorithms has been presented in terms of the number of nodes localized, localization accuracy and the computation time. The results show that the ABC algorithm delivers higher accuracy of localization than the PSO algorithm does; but, it takes longer to converge. This results in a trade off between speed and accuracy of localization in WSNs. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; MATLAB; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; Swarm intelligence; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Global optimization problems; Localization accuracy; Monitoring and tracking; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Symp.

However, these systems accommodate both the request-to-send data process and the confirmation-to-send data process in the same data transmission scheduling window (i.e. data window). This reduces the length of the multi-hop flow setup in the data window. In a multi-hop scenario, this degrades both the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD). In this paper, we propose a cross-layer contention based synchronous MAC protocol, which accommodates the request-to-send data process in the data window and the confirmation-to-send data process in the sleep window for increased efficiency. We evaluate our proposed protocol through ns-2.35 simulations and compare its performance with the PRMAC protocol.

In either case, it is imperative to compute the optimum number of nodes to be deployed such that they collectively satisfy spatial and temporal sampling of the network area. This can be quantified in terms of a critical quality of service (QoS) parameter-Network coverage. Deterministic approach is considered to be straightforward wherein number of nodes to be deployed is estimated using simple geometrical computations assuming disk based binary sensing model. However, the effective sensing radius of a node is affected by sensing device characteristics and environmental factors which leads to non-uniform sensing. These factors are stochastic in nature and can be modeled using probabilistic sensing models. In this paper, we investigate the effect of probabilistic sensing models on the required number of nodes to be deterministically deployed using a square grid based scheme in order to attain a given percentage coverage. The analysis highlights the need for consideration of an appropriate sensing model along with the suitable parametric values for estimation of required number of nodes to be deployed for desired coverage.

The resources in these nodes are restricted in terms of processing, storage, and energy supplies. As the sensor nodes rely on low power batteries for their life, energy efficiency is utmost importance for the majority of its applications. Agriculture is one of the biggest industries where the cost-effective wireless sensor technology is effectively applied to support its functions. Clustering is one of the ways to achieve energy efficiency in such networks. In clustered network, few nodes play the role of cluster heads, summative the data from their members, and pass on them to the sink for further processing. In this work, a distance based grid clustering approach (DC) is proposed that considers energy efficiency as a system-wide problem to focuses on enhancing the overall stability of operation of a network. In addition, two other approaches for cluster head selection based on the node with largest id (LC) and the node with the smallest id (SC) within the cluster is also implemented.

Usually such areas are unreachable rendering battery change of sensor nodes infeasible. So data gathering protocols should be energy efficient to elongate WSN lifetime. We propose a data gathering method coined as FCM-DS-ACO which uses fuzzy c means (FCM) to cluster the sensor nodes. The dominating set (DS) for each cluster is found out and ant colony optimization (ACO) is used to form cluster chains out of the DS. Chain leader (CL) for each cluster chain is selected based on its residual energy and proximity to base station (BS). Data is aggregated as it moves along the cluster chain to CL which transmits it directly to BS. Matlab simulations reveal that FCM-DS-ACO outperforms LEACH, LEACH-C and PEGASIS in extending network lifetime and at the same time providing good percentage coverage of the deployment area.

The algorithm is an extension of centralized Isomap and is capable of effectively localizing new nodes progressively, without neglecting preceding computational results. In the initial startup phase, sensor nodes within two hop range of three non-collinear anchor nodes are localized using range (?)-Isomap. Afterwards, in the progressive phase, the remaining nodes are localized in a sequential manner, using recently localized nodes. The localization process initiated at different nodes in the network give rise to the overlapping substructures of localized nodes. The overlapped substructures are stitched to form a single coordinate system. Finally, Helmert Transformation is used to obtain the global coordinates of the nodes.

In this paper, we evaluate the importance of QoS in the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for WSNs using different metrics and parameters such as energy efficiency, throughput, delay, and the network lifespan. We propose a new QoS MAC protocol, PRIority in Node (PRIN), using static priority in the source and the intermediate node and priority among the node which is one hop from the sink node to achieve QoS in WSNs.

However, in a two-tiered cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving data from their member sensor nodes, aggregating them and transmitting that data to the base station (BS). Therefore, proper selection of CHs and optimal formation of clusters play a crucial role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient CH selection and energy balanced cluster formation algorithms, which are based on novel chemical reaction optimization technique (nCRO), we jointly called these algorithms as novel CRO based energy efficient clustering algorithms (nCRO-ECA). These algorithms are developed with efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and potential energy functions. For the energy efficiency, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes in the CH selection phase. In the cluster formation phase, we consider various distance and energy parameters. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs by varying number of sensor nodes and CHs.

In particular, we consider the problem of maximizing the lifetime of coverage of targets in a wireless sensor network with battery-limited sensors. We first show that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor less than \ln n by any polynomial time algorithm, where n is the number of targets. This provides closure to the long-standing open problem of showing optimality of previously known \ln n approximation algorithms. We also derive a new \ln n approximation to the problem by showing the \ln n approximation to the related maximum disjoint set cover problem. We show that this approach has many advantages over algorithms in the literature, including a simple and optimal extension that solves the problem with multiple coverage constraints. For the 1-D network topology, where sensors can monitor contiguous line segments of possibly different lengths, we show that the optimal coverage lifetime can be found in polynomial time. Finally, for the 2-D topology in which coverage regions are unit squares, we combine the existing results to derive a 1+\epsilon approximation algorithm for the problem. Extensive simulation experiments validate our theoretical results, showing that our algorithms not only have optimal worst case guarantees but also match the performance of the existing algorithms on special network topologies. In addition, our algorithms sometimes run orders of magnitude faster than the existing state of the art. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",approximation algorithms; energy efficiency; scheduling algorithms; Wireless sensor networks,Algorithms; Approximation algorithms; Energy efficiency; Polynomial approximation; Topology; Classical problems; Extensive simulations; Multiple coverages; Network topology; Orders of magnitude; Polynomial-time algorithms; Set cover problem; State of the art; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10636692,,IEANE,,English,IEEE ACM Trans Networking,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975800766

It involves the issues related to energy and dynamic spectrum inherited by WSN and cognitive radio network (CRN) respectively. CRSN poses research challenges in designing an efficient topology control for communication in network. In this paper, we propose an event-driven cluster based routing approach for CRSN that jointly considers both the energy and dynamic spectrum challenges. Reported schemes for CRSN suffer from high frequency of re-clustering due to PU activities and are energy inefficient. The proposed scheme employs a self-organized distributed clustering to obtain less average node power by producing the optimal number of clusters. To mitigate the effect of PUs' activities, our proposed scheme forms clusters having more number of common channels. To enhance inter-cluster connectivity, our proposed scheme selects gateway nodes having more number of common channels with neighboring nodes. Furthermore, a cluster-head (CH) rotation mechanism is employed that picks the CH based on nodes' residual energy values, available channels, neighbors and distance to the sink in order to have longer network lifetime. Upon detection of an event, the proposed scheme aims to route the event samples through an energy efficient and stable path from source node to the sink node. On performance evaluation, we found that our proposed scheme outperforms in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and stability of selected gateway nodes than considered competitive approaches. © 2016 IEEE.",clustering; Cognitive radio sensor networks; energy consumption; routing protocol,Cognitive radio; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based routing; clustering; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Distributed clustering; Distributed events; Opportunistic spectrum access; Packet delivery ratio; Research challenges; Gateways (computer networks),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

In this paper we propose an energy-saving video compression technique for WMSN with a newly proposed differential inter frame partial discrete wavelet technique. Considering the application domain where video frames from an array of video sensors are co-related we exploit this inter frame co-relation by taking the partial wavelet transform between the frames followed by identifying the difference of wavelet of these frames. The scheme works in accordance with a tree based routing scheme for randomly placed node with an aim to reduce energy consumption further. The evaluation of the proposed scheme is performed through simulation and statistical analysis on the simulation results. The efficiency of the scheme is measured in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).

In WSN data sending directly to the sink node can raise various problems. Information gathering technique is the center of the Wireless Sensor Network. In WNS data is gathered by sensor nodes and these gathered data is sent to the base station (BS). This is the basic working of WSN. With the data collection, network lifetime is also the major principle for design of data aggregation technique in sensor network. Most of the energy of the remote sensor network is utilized for data sending. Data aggregation is performed to avoid such problems related to energy. Cluster as well as tree structures are utilized to preform data aggregation in present systems. We propose an energy-effective system in which data collection nodes are utilized for gathering data from cluster head inside the cluster. The lifetime of the wireless network is improved by forwarding the data in aggregated format.

When building wireless sensor networks network there is critical issues are emerged such as preserving energy and load balancing. Lifetime of a sensor network is enhanced by implementing and mitigating energy consumption. Number of various parameters such as number of nodes, strength and range of area as well as connectivity of nodes in the network are responsible for the lifetime of network. Energy of battery is most important things for sensor nodes in wireless sensor network. Efficient energy is major part of in mitigate the overhead as well as limited transmission and aggregating data is also important for the enhancing network lifetime. We proposed a clustering routing protocol CRT2FLACO on the basis of type-2 fuzzy logic as well as ACO for balancing the network load and to enhance the lifetime of WSN. Our proposed protocol determines the three fundamental parts of residual energy, neighbor nodes as well as the distance to base station as inputs of a type-2 Mamdani FLS and after that calculate the possibility of a node upgrading as a candidate cluster head and the cluster head competition radius. Implementation of type-2 fuzzy logic is better way to control the overhead existing in WSN. Load of network is efficiently handled by fuzzy unequal competition radius as well as implementation of multi-hop routing protocol technique for data transmission. Additionally, security of data is determined by utilizing encryption algorithm in transmission of data.

These sensor networks are responsible to sense, computation and transmission. In certain conditions sensor node cannot able to communicate with its neighbor nodes and may turn to 'dumb node'. In such situations it can sense its environment but is unable to communicate. Due to this the nodes cannot able to communicate with its nearest nodes. This is because of contraction in communication range which happens due to the detriment environmental effects. However communicating with other nodes gets break up. Thus it is necessary to identify dumb nodes and replace the dumb nodes for effective communication. By placing minimum number of relay nodes the problem of dumb nodes can be solved.

This project presents the clustering approach which includes the Wireless sensor network. In the clustering approaches share the loads with cluster head nodes. To extend the cluster head's life and extend the life time of network based on the distance between the cluster head and base station. Energy usage is minimized by exploiting density estimation, sleeping modes and duty cycle control and distance between the cluster head and nodes. In this work, we proposed clustering mechanism. Nodes associate with the nearby CH. Nodes are classified in to critical nodes and non-critical nodes. Critical nodes are continuously transmission between the CH and nodes. so energy usage of critical node is high at the same time non-critical node based on the open loop system. It is not continiously transmit, so minimized energy usage of non-critical nodes.

Mostly WSNs are used for applications such as military surveillance and disaster monitoring. WSNs are multi-hop networks, which depend on the intermediate nodes to relay the data packet to the destination. These nodes are equipped with lesser memory, limited battery power, little computation capability, small range of communication and need a secured and efficient routing path to forward the incoming packet delay by data aggregation) and multipath sensor networks to increase the resilience and reliability of the network. The localization information is crucial for the operation of WSN. There are mainly two types of Localization algorithms. The Range-based localization algorithm has requirements on hardware, thus is expensive to be implemented in practice. The Range-free localization algorithm reduces the hardware cost.

WSN composes of large number of sensor nodes, which are tiny, low powered, densely deployed in an ad hoc fashion either inside a physical phenomenon to be sensed or very closely to it. The region around the sink forms a bottleneck zone due to heavy traffic flow, which reduces the lifetime of WSN. One of the constraints in the WSNs is limited battery power of the sensor nodes which in turn can reduce the lifetime of WSN. This paper attempts to improve the network lifetime by considering duty cycle, network coding and clustering techniques. The results show that the lifetime of the WSN can be enhanced by combining duty cycle, Network coding and clustering.

Fault tolerance in cluster level is achieved by eliminating the incorrect data of nodes.

Existing literature on k - coverage does not consider residual energy levels and actual battery discharge rate of ACTIVE nodes. OBSP (Optimized Backoff Sleep Protocol) considers the residual energy level information and battery discharge rate but ignores the k-coverage degree. This paper proposes k-CGP (k-Coverage Guarantee Protocol) based on battery discharge curve using polynomial regression for different coverage degrees (k). k-CGP determines the optimal wakeup rate of sleeping nodes by computing Optimal Sleep Time derived from battery discharge curve using polynomial regression and Received Signal Strength Indicator for distance estimation. The coverage redundancy is computed by using equi-distance test. Due to this, a sufficient number of ACTIVE nodes could be maintained while achieving lesser energy consumption in the network. Simulation results show that k-CGP achieves higher energy savings and sensing area coverage as compared to PEAS. © 2016 IEEE.",Battery discharge rate; Coverage degree; Coverage redundancy; Energy efficiency; Optimal duty cycle; Regression analysis,Electric batteries; Electronic equipment; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Redundancy; Regression analysis; Sensor nodes; Sleep research; Thermoelectric equipment; Battery discharge; Battery discharge curves; Coverage degree; Distance estimation; Distributed sensor networks; Duty-cycle; Polynomial regression; Received signal strength indicators; Wireless sensor networks,"More, A.; Mukesh Patel School of Technology, Management and Engineering, NMIMS UniversityIndia; email: avinash.more@nmims.edu",,IEEE Computer Society,21592047,9.78151E+12,,,English,Int.

As India being predominantly a tea consuming nation, about 80% of the country's coffee production is exported. The cultivation of coffee is primarily in the southern states of India and depends predominantly on the south west monsoon. Due to the current change in the climate patterns, artificial irrigation is essential to boost the productivity. Various studies have proven that the crop experiences water stress during dry season and this inhibits the blossoming of buds, consequently reducing the yield considerably. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) assists in monitoring the soil and environmental parameters through appropriate sensors. Soil moisture sensors and soil electrical conductivity sensors can help to detect the water and nutrient deficit in the soil and appropriately apply water and nutrients through drip irrigation system. A leaf wetness sensor can also be used to estimate the transpiration and photosynthesis rate besides predicting the risk of bacterial and fungal attacks. The irrigation can be scheduled and automated based on the prevailing field conditions. © 2016 IEEE.",irrigation; irrigation scheduling; soil moisture; WSN,Automation; Climate change; Irrigation; Moisture; Moisture control; Nutrients; Risk perception; Soil moisture; Soils; Climate patterns; Drip irrigation systems; Environmental parameter; Field conditions; Irrigation scheduling; Photosynthesis rate; Soil electrical conductivity; Soil moisture sensors; Wireless sensor networks,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

It leads to the fact that the nearest sensor nodes fail much earlier than remote ones, In the long run, traffic from all the sensor nodes is going through one sensor node that is nearest to sink and the former disrupt the work of the rest of WSN. From the point of view of energy saving, big WSNs with only one sink cannot consume resources effectively. To solve this problem it is necessary to divide the WSN into clusters.

All such applications and environments need energy efficient routing. This has led to the evolution of hierarchical routing which has attracted many professionals towards this field for research and development. Hierarchical routing is energy-efficient and useful in several situations. It can be basically categorized in two types. First one is typical hierarchical routing protocols and second one is atypical hierarchical routing protocols. However, there are no such significant differences between both of them because atypical protocols are just a subset of typical hierarchical routing protocols. There are various survey papers which focus on typical routing protocols and very few papers which cover especially atypical routing protocols. There is no such paper which covers both categories collectively which can ease users to compare them for the best suitability. This survey aims to fulfill the same requirement and covers some renowned protocols from both categories. © 2016 IEEE.",atypical routing; hierarchical routing; logical topologies; typical routing; Wireless Sensor Networks; WSNs,Energy efficiency; Routing protocols; Surveys; Topology; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; atypical routing; Hierarchical routings; Logical topology; typical routing; WSNs; Power management (telecommunication),,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

These tasks may consist of very complex functions and large calculations. In order to make network alive for a long duration, these sensors have to take decision in judicious and efficient manner. The increased lifetime results into increased connectivity. Also, the intellectual use of energy resources provides the nodes better connectivity to the base station. The different clustering protocols such as Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) are used in order to gain energy efficiency. The LEACH uses probability as the key attribute to elect the new cluster head. In this paper, a new approach based on the frequency of a node selected as cluster head for the selection of new cluster head is proposed which is also more efficient than the former one. The proposed approach for cluster head selection results in increased lifetime and thus, in increased connectivity. Simulation results show that in terms of different parameters like number of live nodes, dead nodes and residual energy our proposed strategy outperforms existing conventional sensor network protocols. © 2016 IEEE.",clustering; connectivity; coverage; energy-efficiency; frequency; lifetime; protocol,Complex networks; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Leaching; Network protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; clustering; connectivity; coverage; frequency; lifetime; Sensor nodes,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The sensor nodes collect the information through neighboring nodes to particular node. The data collection and processing is done by data aggregation techniques. For the data aggregation in sensor network, clustering technique is implemented in the sensor network by implementing self organizing feature map (SOFM) neural network. Some of the sensor nodes are selected as cluster head nodes. The information aggregated to cluster head nodes from non cluster head nodes and then this information is transferred to base station (or sink nodes). The aim of this paper is to manage the huge amount of data with the help of SOM neural network.

In WSN, nodes have limited power and low processing capacity. Moreover, a homogeneous sensor network comprises of nodes having similar behavior. These constraints make it difficult to identify compromised nodes in such a network. Compromised nodes are those nodes whose behavior are dissimilar from normal nodes. Compromised node can be harmful for the network. To solve the problem of finding compromised node we are using anomaly detection technique. In this technique the behavior of nodes is observed and checked whether it is normal or not. We select some Intrusion Detection System(IDS) agents on the basis of internal congestion within the node. IDS agent are trained to analyze the behavior of the nodes and are able to check the deviation in the behavior of the nodes. We provide a matrix to IDS agent, which is stored in their buffer. This matrix consist of parameters which are related to the behavior of the node. Input value of the matrix is 0 or 1, if the matrix result is 1 then the behavior of the node is abnormal(deviation from normal). The IDS agents send the unique identifier of the compromised node to the Base Station. Base Station will finally check how many messages a node can send to Base Station. If the number is greater than the maximum message limit then the node is considered to be compromised node. The algorithm which is proposed in this paper can be efficient for the small networks. © 2016 IEEE.",,Base stations; Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Matrix algebra; Mercury (metal); Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Anomaly detection; Compromised nodes; Input values; Intrusion Detection Systems; Processing capacities; Recent researches; Small networks; Unique identifiers; Sensor nodes,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Several user authentication schemes are proposed in the literature. However, most of them are either vulnerable to different known attacks or they are inefficient. Recently, Althobaiti et al. presented a biometric-based user authentication scheme for WSNs. Although their scheme is efficient in computation, in this paper, we first show that their scheme has several security pitfalls such as (i) it is not resilient against node capture attack; (ii) it is insecure against impersonation attack; and (iii) it is insecure against man-in-the-middle attack. We then aim to propose a novel biometric-based user authentication scheme suitable for WSNs in order to withstand the security pitfalls found in Althobaiti et al. scheme. We show through the rigorous security analysis that our scheme is secure and satisfies the desirable security requirements. Furthermore, the simulation results for the formal security verification using the most widely used and accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool indicate that our scheme is secure.

Important points to be considered in this application are to secure the location of monitored objects. In presence of object sensor nodes sends event reporting messages periodically. Attackers can back track those messages to reach at source to capture the object. Different kind of techniques have been developed to protect the object from adversary like 'Phantom routing', Cyclic entrapping method (CEM) and Path extension method (PEM) which provides source location privacy in some extend but not provides 100 percent safety to the source. In this Paper a new method called Bypassing using Directional Transceivers (BDT) is introduced which performs well in case of safety, energy consumption and throughput analysis. Within a sensor network instead of using single transceiver in this new method four directional transceivers are used to provide better safety.

Tsunamis occur in coastal areas which can be detected by sensors that are deployed underwater. A Tsunami Detection System is used to detect tsunamis and spread warning messages to prevent loss of life and establishments. This paper presents a novel framework for implementing Intelligent Information Retrieval Technique in a Tsunami Detection System using Wireless Sensor Networks. This system generates intelligent data and spreads a warning message about the occurrence of tsunami. The proposed method uses SentiWordNet, a lexical resource explicitly used for opinion mining. This framework extracts intelligent information from the messages which are transmitted by first filtering the redundant text from them followed by stemming and stop words removal and then gathers all the opinion words and calculates their sentiment values using SentiWordNet. Thereafter polarity of the text is calculated and a warning message is conveyed. The proposed method is implemented for determining the magnitude of earthquakes, which is very essential to generate tsunami warnings. © 2016 IEEE.",Coastal Areas; Information Retrieval; Intelligent Information; Tsunami Detection System; Wireless Sensor Networks,Coastal zones; Earthquakes; Information filtering; Information retrieval; Search engines; Tsunamis; Coastal area; Distributed sensor; Intelligent data; Intelligent information; Intelligent information retrieval; Lexical resources; Tsunami detection; Warning messages; Wireless sensor networks,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

One of the ways of doing it is by using a global positioning system (GPS). However, systems based on GPS consume larger amount of power and may fail in covered regions. Moreover changing batteries frequently is also a problem. In this paper we have discussed the design and implementation of an energy-efficient cross-layered protocol stack for an application of wireless sensor networks aimed at tracking the co-ordinates of a mobile entity for habitat monitoring. We have implemented this on TelosB motes using TinyOS. This paper focuses on development of protocols pertaining to three layers of the stack viz. physical layer, MAC layer and application layer. The protocols implemented include variants of timing-sync protocol for sensor networks, weighted centroid localization and sensor medium access control (SMAC). Our SMAC variant forms the basic framework upon which the localization and time synchronization algorithms are implemented in the data period and synchronization period, respectively. The results of the designed protocols are significant and demonstrate the potential of the performance of the protocol stack. © 2016 IEEE.",cross layered protocol stack; habitat monitoring; SMAC; TelosB motes; TinyOS; TPSN; WCL; Wireless sensor networks,Access control; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Global positioning system; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Network layers; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Habitat monitoring; Protocol stack; SMAC; TelosB motes; TinyOS; TPSN; Wireless sensor networks,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The performance of the routing protocols depends of the various factors in the network like packets size, types of signals, movement of nodes (mobility model), data transmission rate, power consuming rate and types of topologies or network architecture. The consuming of battery power is the serious issue for the performance of routing protocols in the network, in term of lifetime of the network and packets delivery ratio as well. Initially, that is considered different routing protocols with different topologies and also considered mobility model like Random way point mobility and group based mobility for the analysis then evaluate the performance. Mobility model highly impact on the performance of routing protocols and lifetime of the network because movement of the nodes consumed more energy than stationary nodes.

In an UWASN, passive node mobility is inevitable. Therefore, the performance analysis of UWASNs renders meaningful insights with the inclusion of a mobility model, which represents realistic oceanic scenarios. In this regard, the existing works on performance analysis of UWASNs lack the consideration of major dominating forces, which offer impetus for a node's mobility. Additionally, the existing works are limited to only shallow depths and coastal areas. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a physical mobility model, named Oceanic Forces Mobility Model, by incorporating important realistic oceanic forces imparted on nodes. The proposed model considers the effects of node mobility in 3-D space of water. We also present an analysis on the impact of node mobility on the performance of UWASNs in terms of network dispersion and localization. Simulation results indicate performance degradation of UWASNs in the presence of oceanic forceslocalization coverage decreases by 36.70%, localization error increases nearly by 21.14%, and average energy consumption increases by 3% approximately.

Further, there are various situations in which coal mining using conventional methods is formidable or costly, and, thus, UCG makes it feasible for recovering those coal resources from underground as alternative forms of energy. However, the environmental risk, particularly aquifer contamination, is a major bottleneck in adopting this technology by the industry. Concurrently, wireless sensor network (WSN) is a promising technology currently for use in various industrial process monitoring and control applications. The easy deployment, scalability, and low power consumption make WSN specially attractive.

A dumb node can sense its surroundings, but is unable to transmit these sensed data to any other node, due to the sudden onset of adverse environmental effects. However, such a node resumes its normal operations with the resumption of favorable environmental conditions. Due to the presence of dumb nodes, the network is unable to provide the expected services. Therefore, it is prudent to re-establish connectivity between dumb and other nodes, so that sensed data can be reliably transmitted to the sink. Before the re-establishment of connectivity, a node needs to confirm its actual state of being dumb. Dumb behavior is dynamic in nature, and is, thus, distinct from the traditional node isolation problem considered in stationary WSNs. Therefore, the existing schemes for the detection of other misbehaviors are not applicable for detecting a dumb node in a WSN. Considering this temporal behavior of a dumb node, we propose an approach, D3, for the detection of dumb nodes. In the propose scheme, we uses cumulative sum test, which helps in detecting the dumb behavior. The simulation results show that there is 56% degradation in detection percentage with the increment in the detection threshold, whereas energy consumption and the message overhead increase by 40% with the increment in detection threshold.

Some important applications of WSN are military, machine surveillance, preventive maintenance, disaster relief operations etc. In this type of network, routing is a little bit more complex as compared to ordinary wireless or wired networks. The routing protocols those are applied for different types of the other networks cannot be used here because here in WSN, nodes are battery powered. Due to this, WSN should be the energy efficient. Entire network lifetime is depending on efficient energy consumption in sensor network. Clustering is one of the techniques to utilize the energy of network efficiently. This method consumes extra communication overhead in exchanging messes for selecting appropriate cluster head. This type of transmission of message from node to node consumes extra energy that makes energy resources inefficient. This paper provides an approach to prolong the WSN lifetime using fuzzy logic based selection of cluster head that provides completely non probabilistic approach. This approach uses two fuzzy variables: Base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. In this approach multi-hop communication is used. One cluster Head (CH) has the authority to communicate with the other CH and also with the BS.

As a stream of packets from the source node is sent to the sink, the adversary may be able to trace the messages and try to find out the source location. While monitoring the target, the revealed information about the subject can be misused by the adversary. Hence, our aim is to hide the source location from the adversary. It is quite difficult to efficiently achieve the source location privacy although the confidentiality of the messages can be well assured through data encryption. In WSN, the source location privacy is more complex due to the fact that the nodes comprise low-power and low-cost devices. The protocols based on large-scale communications are not suitable for WSN.

In this paper we have used hybrid approach for creating the clusters and for forwarding the data to base station. The Cluster Heads(CHs) for first two rounds will be elected by base-station using centralized algorithm and from third round, CHs are selected by the previous cluster heads using distributed algorithm. We introduce a mobile IGN (Integrated Gateway Node) which acts as an interface between CHs and base station. The data transmission from the sensor nodes to the CH will takes place using proactive algorithm and the data transmission between mobile node and base station uses reactive algorithm.

Wireless sensor systems are outfitted with minor, essential batteries and along these lines it is important to plan vitality effective calculations to draw out the system lifetime. In remote sensor systems (WSNs), the sink versatility along an obliged mode can enhance the vitality proficiency. Sink mobility is an imperative method to enhance sensor system execution including vitality utilization, end-To-end delay and lifetime. To manage the above issues researches introduced a Rendezvous design technique, where some sensor nodes are selected as an RP's and the nodes which are not RP's will forward data to the nearest RP's. The major issue in this design is to find the set of RP's and determine the tour that visits these RP's.

By using clustering approach, the energy consumption of nodes in the network can be decreased thereby increasing its lifetime. In various multi-hop cluster-based routing protocols, nodes nearer to the Base Station (BS) exhaust their energy quickly than other nodes as data from the entire network is forwarded to BS through them. Due to this, nearby nodes die sooner and network get partitioned. This is known as hot spot problem. This paper proposes a load balanced and energy efficient data collection scheme using data mule for larger network area. The proposed protocol is based on the centralized approach which uses fixed clustering. In this protocol, the BS divides the whole network into fixed rectangular shaped clusters of unequal size. The size of the cluster is dependent on its distance from the central vertical path of the data mule. To overcome from more energy loss at the clusters nearer to this vertical path due to more data handling, proposed protocol introduces unequal size grid clustering approach. It also ensures that the transmission distance for any communication in the network is less than the threshold distance of the energy consumption model. It also increases load balancing in terms of energy consumption and data traffic.

In this approach mobile sink gather the inform the static sensors of the network and transfer it to base station. For efficiently gather the data sink's mobility pattern should be decided so the data collection time will be reduced. Sink Trail (ST) and Sink Trail-S (STS) protocols are used to find shortest path for data forwarding through the nodes to sink. Constant updating of unnecessary sink location needs to be reduced. Therefore STS protocol is proposed to overcome the difficulty of ST protocol. The logical coordinate system (LCS) is proposed for the ease of routing and forwarding and because of it any location prediction strategy or GPS not required. This protocol enhances the energy efficiency. We analyze the impact of broadcasting frequency on route length and energy consumption.

The self configuring and infrastructure less property of MANETs makes them easily deployable anywhere and extremely dynamic in nature. Lack of centralized administration and coordinator are the reasons for MANET to be vulnerable to active attack like black hole. Black hole attack is ubiquitous in mobile ad hoc as well as wireless sensor networks. Black hole affected node, without knowing actual route to destination, spuriously replies to have shortest route to destination and entice the traffic towards itself to drop it. Network containing such node may not work according to the protocol being used for routing. Commonly used protocols like ADOV, DSR, and so forth in MANET are not designed to tackle black hole attack or black hole affected routes. Hence this paper proposes an AODV-based secure routing mechanism to detect and eliminate black hole attack and affected routes in the early phase of route discovery.

Although most number of proposals have come through to validate its parameters still there are small issues which pose a large threat to the performance criterion of WSN, one among is the hand over which is least addressed in all types of advancements and still poses a problem for the sensor-nodes with not enough computation capability, restricted power and less memory size. In the handoff procedure the mobiles user fluctuates from one area to another area of coverage when the call duration is still enabled, under such scenarios since his motion shifts from one station to other the signal gets deteriorated and connectivity to the next system creates a delay due to which handover is caused.

In this approach, we propose a trust administration plan for UWSNs to give effective and vigorous trust information stockpiling and trust era. For trust information stockpiling, we utilize a geographic hash table to distinguish stockpiling hubs and to altogether lessening stockpiling cost. We utilize subjective rationale based agreement strategies to moderate trust variances brought about by ecological variables. We abuse an arrangement of trust similitude capacities to identify trust exceptions and to support trust contamination assaults. We illustrate, through broad investigations and reproductions, that the proposed plan is effective, powerful and versatile. In this Project we have to form a Wireless Sensor Network with different set of nodes in it. Each node has a capacity to travel from one place to another, if any node wants to make a communication with another node, it has to make a request to the recipient node to identify whether that node is able to receive or not, once the recipient acknowledges for the request connection is established between source and destination. In between it also checks if any of the nodes are unattended in the scenario which means that it acts like a malicious node and that should be eliminated while transactions.

Biomedical wireless sensor network (BWSN) plays a vital role in this connection because it can be attached to the patient without causing any inconvenience to him/her and can communicate to any remote healthcare office without any delay. BWSN consists of individual nodes to collect the patient's information and communicate it to the remote health centre if the value of sensed signal is beyond normal range. The nodes deployed within the patients form a BWSN, and the network has to send the information from the source to the remote sink in an efficient way. The network should choose an optimized path for this communication, so that the nodes lifetime is increased. This paper presents a Q-learning-algorithm-based routing concept to route the sensed information if required from the individual node to the remote healthcare station. Simulations are made with a set of mobile biomedical wireless sensor nodes within an area of 100 m × 100 m flat space operating for 600 seconds of simulation time. Results show that the Q-learning-based approach requires less time to route the packet from the source node to the destination remote station. © 2017 IETE.",Biomedical wireless sensor network; Optimization; Q-learning; Routing,Bioinformatics; Health care; Learning algorithms; Network routing; Optimization; Physiological models; Sensor nodes; Abnormal behaviours; Corrective actions; Optimized routing; Physiological parameters; Q-learning; Q-learning algorithms; Routing; Wireless sensor node; Wireless sensor networks,,,Taylor and Francis Ltd,3772063,,,,English,IETE J Res,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992163185

Earlier works did not concentrate on both fault management and loss recovery issues. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a reliable data aggregation scheme is proposed that uses support vector machine (SVM) for performing failure detection and loss recovery. Initially, a group head, selected based on node connectivity, splits the nodes into clusters based on their location information. In each cluster, the cluster member with maximum node connectivity is chosen as the cluster head. When the aggregator receives data from the source, it identifies node failures in the received data by classifying the faulty data using SVM. Furthermore, a reserve node-based fault recovery mechanism is developed to prevent data loss. Through simulations, we show that the proposed technique minimises the transmission overhead and increases reliability. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Data aggregation; sensor nodes; support vector machine; wireless sensor network,Classification (of information); Computer system recovery; Recovery; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Data aggregation; Failure detection; Fault management; Faultrecovery mechanisms; Location information; Node connectivity; Reliable data aggregation; Transmission overheads; Sensor nodes,"Kamalesh, S.; Information Technology, Anna UniversityIndia; email: skl@vcet.ac.in",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,0952813X,,,,English,J.

Multi-hop data forwarding from sensor nodes to the base station reduces energy consumption of individual sensor nodes but generates hot-spot problem. In this work, we propose a multi-hop relay based energy saving network management scheme with mobile sink in WSN named MESNET which reduces energy consumption and extend the network lifetime while maintaining a pre-bound delay between a sensor node and its associated cluster head (CH). In the setup phase, an efficient generation of cluster heads (EGENC) algorithm runs to find a subset of deployed sensor nodes as CHs. CHs are selected based on the residual energy and the energy consumed in the last round data communication of sensor nodes. Number of relay hops between a cluster member node and the CH is restricted to balance the network load. For further balancing the network load, we use an upper limit on number of member nodes of a CH. Efficient selection of the CHs reduces the path length of the mobile sink.

However, a few sensor nodes die during the network operation due to energy constraints which may break the coverage of the target area. We refer this as a coverage hole problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called CHD-CR which attempts to restore the coverage after detecting a coverage hole in the target area. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of coverage hole detection (CHD) and coverage restoration (CR) phases. We design an efficient local mechanism for coverage hole detection and energy efficient technique for its restoration. We test the performance of the proposed algorithm through simulation and the results are compared with the existing algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed CHD-CR algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of coverage preservation for longer time. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Coverage hole; Coverage preservation; Coverage restoration; Energy efficient; Wireless sensor networks,Algorithms; Energy efficiency; Restoration; Sensor nodes; Coverage holes; Coverage restoration; Energy constraint; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient techniques; Network operations; Restoration algorithm; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Amgoth, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: tarachand.ism@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,19366442,,,,English,Peer-to-Peer Netw.

Sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station. In recent years, such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas. Generally, sensor nodes are small, cost-effective, memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment. Energy is one of the significant factors in such network. Whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place. Sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster. The purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way. A cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station. An efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption, thereby increasing network lifetime. One major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round, cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region. This process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head. Transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource. In this paper, a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the WSNs lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed. In this, whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (GH) using two fuzzy variables, viz., base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. This approach uses a multi-hop communication approach. GH nodes are authorized to communicate with other GH nodes and base station. Simulation results show that the proposed approach prolongs WSNs network lifetime than existing ones. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Fuzzy logic; Grid head; Non-probabilistic; Wireless sensor networks,Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head selections; Consumption of energy; Environmental conditions; Grid head; Multi hop communication; Non-probabilistic; Processing capability; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Kumar, V.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of TechnologyIndia; email: vimalmnnit16@gmail.com",Sahana S.K.Saha S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

As direct transmissions are costly, multi-hop approach is often used to collect the data of the nodes at the sink. However, many-to-one communication pattern in multi-hop communication may result in an unbalanced energy consumption in the network. Nodes closer to the sink deplete their energy at a faster rate than nodes that are further away. Mixed transmission approach, where each node trades-off between the cheaper hop-by-hop transmission and costlier direct transmission, is a good solution for balancing energy consumption. This paper proposes a receiver contention based mixed transmission scheme for energy balancing. In addition to distance and residual energy of the receivers, it also considers the link reliability and the number of neighboring nodes, in setting of the timer that will determine the relay node selection. The proposed approach gives more efficient and effective energy balanced data transmission as compared with the other works proposed in the literature. Its performance is evaluated and presented both analytically and through simulations, and the analytical estimations are validated by the simulation results. The simulation results show a significant improvement over the other closely related approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily used with both uniform as well as non-uniform node deployment. © 2016",Energy balanced data transmission; Energy-efficiency; Mixed hop transmission schemes; Routing; Wireless sensor network,Channel capacity; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy balance; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Transmissions; Wireless sensor networks; Analytical estimations; Balancing energy consumption; Energy-balanced; Hop-by-hop transmission; Many-to-one communications; Multi hop communication; Routing; Transmission schemes; Energy efficiency,"Kulshrestha, J.; Department of Computer Engineering and Applications, GLA UniversityIndia; email: jagrati.kulshrestha@gla.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,15708705,,,,English,Ad Hoc Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994407046

One of the major investigation in the consideration of MWSNs sustains from the problem of system throughput and end-to-end delay along with the issue of energy consumption. This idle illustrates a X-layer network (cross-layer network) transformation model that can decline the problem of energy consumption and along with end-to-end delay in these networks. In this paper, the moderate model restrains four layers in the network transformation: (a) application layer, which has been utilized to update the node locality and information; (b) network layer, which has been accomplished to recognize the routing of the internetwork through links; (c) MAC (medium access control) layer, which has been centralized on the effectiveness of the networks, and (d) physical layer has also been recommended keeping the intentional view on transmission power from sensor node to the sink node. The place/location and position/status of the mobile node is interlinked in the routing transformation immediately as soon as the route finding process is successfully terminated and then it is been employed by controlling the transmission power of the MAC layer to rectify the range of the transmission with respect to the route. As per the future expectations of practical characteristics is concerned, adjacent NB(neighbor) list discovery broadcast will be engaged only for active nodes. But this paper is accomplished an modern technique, i.e., mobility aware protocol, which recognizes the mobility (velocity/speed) of the nodes so that only those respective nodes will be upgraded with its adjacent NB-list broadcasting, resulting in minimum power utilized by the network interface and also in the degradation of the energy consumption of the nodes. In spite of the above concern, one more additional cause approaching in this model is the issue of bottleneck problem, which has been established due to multiple sources resulting in huge packet loss. This issue has been solved by pipe-lining those packets of the sensor which are nearer to the sink node, which results in reduction of end-to-end delay and energy utilization resulting in high system throughput. Through NS-II simulation, the results of energy consumption, system throughput, end-to-end delay, etc., has been shown. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",End-to-end delay; Energy efficiency; IEEE 802.15.4 protocol; Mobile WSNs; System throughput; X-layer network transformation model,Access control; Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent computing; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Packet networks; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Standards; Throughput; Wireless sensor networks; End to end delay; IEEE 802.15.4; Layer networks; Mobile WSNs; System throughput; Network layers,"Mohiddin, M.K.; Department of ECE, GITAM UniversityIndia; email: khwaja7388@gmail.com",Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Coverage and lifetime maximisation are two major challenges. The node scheduling approaches address these problems: 1) achieving the connectivity and desired coverage while keeping the optimal nodes in active state; 2) resolving conflicts while determining the nodes to keep in sleep state; 3) finding strategies that avoid waking up redundant nodes. A node scheduling protocol for target coverage as an extension of energy efficient coverage preserving protocol (EECP), which determined the set covers based on the coverage probability and trust values is proposed. The clustering mechanism based on residual energy, distance and degree of the nodes is used for the dynamic selection of cluster heads.

First we assume that mobile sensors move straight during localization which helps us to provide an upper bound on localization error. Certain applications may not allow sensors to move in a straight line. Obstacles may also obstruct path of sensors. Moreover beacon point selection becomes difficult in presence of obstacles.

The proposed protocol organizes network nodes into clusters and categorizes nodes into critical and non-critical nodes. It establishes unique pair-wise keys only for pairs of active neighboring sensor nodes after analysis of the network traffic and minimizes the storage overhead. The protocol is distributed and is able to handle compromise of both critical and non-critical nodes.

The paper proposes a hybrid scheduling protocol for target coverage for wireless sensor networks which determines the number of set covers for monitoring all the targets using the probabilistic coverage model, node contribution and trust values. The optimal observation probability is obtained for the parameter values of the sensing and communication characteristics of the nodes using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and probabilistic coverage model. The proposed protocol uses a node scheduling technique using Fuzzy Logic to activate the nodes to form the set covers. The proposed protocol is validated for a smaller network and is simulated for a real large network. The simulation results show that the performance of proposed protocol improves the network efficiency in terms of coverage, network lifetime and reliability in terms of trust factor.

This study focuses on misbehaviors arising due to the presence of\enskip ""dumb"" nodes [Misra et al. 2014; Roy et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Kar and Misra 2015], which can sense its surroundings but cannot communicate with its neighbors due to shrinkage in its communication range by the environmental effects attributed to change in temperature, rainfall, and fog. However, a dumb node is expected to behave normally on the onset of favorable environmental conditions. Therefore, the presence of such dumb nodes in the network gives rise to impaired connectivity between a subset of nodes and, consequently, results in change in topology. Such phenomena are dynamic in nature and are thus distinct from the phenomena attributed to traditional isolation problems considered in stationary WSNs. Activation of all the sensor nodes simultaneously is not necessarily energy efficient and cost-effective. In order to maintain self-adaptivity of the network, two algorithms, named Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes (CoRD) and Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes Without Applying Constraints (CoRDWAC), are designed. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated through simulation-based experiments. Further, it is also observed that the performance of CoRD is better than the existing topology control protocols-LETC and A1-with respect to the number of nodes activated, overhead, and energy consumption. © 2017 ACM.",Connectivity; Dumb node; Dynamic shrinkage; Self-adaptivity; Wireless sensor network,Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Shrinkage; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; Communication range; Connectivity; Dumb node; Dynamic shrinkage; Environmental conditions; Self adaptivity; Topology control protocols; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,,,Association for Computing Machinery,15564665,,,,English,ACM Trans.

The increased use of wireless devices and installation of cell phone towers in the recent years produces abundant radio frequency (RF) energy in the ambient environment. This makes the RF energy scavenging as an attractive possibility. The energy scavenging module consists of an antenna to capture RF energy and appropriate circuitry for RF to DC conversion. In the present work, a microstrip-fed printed shorted ring slot antenna with circular polarization is chosen for collecting RF energy. The bridge rectifier with Schottky diode is used for RF to DC conversion. The novelty of the work lies in the design of a highly efficient yet simple and compact rectenna module for energy harvesting in the GSM 900 band using circularly polarized antenna. The antenna structure is designed and optimized using CST microwave studio. The bridge rectifier circuit is designed using SPICE software.

Efficient usage of energy is a key issue in WSN application such as target tracking. Another important criterion is a tracking accuracy that can be achieved by using appropriate tracking mechanism. Because of the special characteristic of WSN, there is a trade-off between tracking accuracy and power consumption. Our aim is to improve tracking accuracy as well as provide energy-efficient solution by integrating the concept of clustering and prediction techniques. This paper presents Energy-Efficient Constant Gain Kalman Filter based Tracking (EECGKFT) algorithm to optimize the energy usage and to increase the tracking accuracy. There is also a need to collect data from network having a mobile Base Station (BS). Hence, performance of proposed algorithm is analyzed for a static BS and also for mobile BS. The results depict that proposed algorithm performs better compared to the existing algorithms in energy efficiency and prediction accuracy. Analysis of results validates that EECGKFT increases energy efficiency by reducing transmission of unnecessary data in the sensor network environment and also provides good tracking results. © 2017 Kirti Hirpara and Keyur Rana.",,Bandpass filters; Clutter (information theory); Economic and social effects; Kalman filters; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Mobile base station; Prediction accuracy; Prediction techniques; Sensor network environment; Tracking accuracy; Tracking mechanism; Wsn applications; Energy efficiency,,,Hindawi Limited,15308669,,,,English,Wireless Commun.

These sensor nodes are battery operated and it is difficult to recharge them in the field, so inclusion of energy efficiency is must in the protocols of these networks. Clustering is one of the most popular methods to achieve it. In clustering, the network is divided into various clusters and cluster head of every cluster is responsible to transfer the data to central location (base station). This paper introduces a balanced energy routing protocol based on LEACH-C for WSN. Our proposal not only selects the maximum energy node as cluster head but also distributes the load among the various clusters evenly. This balances the energy consumption among various nodes hence increases the lifetime of the network. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol through simulation indicates a significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency as compared to other well-known protocols.

This condenses load balancing in the network. If the cluster heads collaborate with each other and transfer data based on multihop transmission, then the cluster heads nearer to the sink node are burdened with significant relay traffic and deplete energy much faster, which causes a network coverage problem also known as a hot spot problem. To avoid both of the above problems, this paper proposes two protocols: LEACHDistance and LEACHDistance-M. LEACHDistance is proposed for static wireless sensor networks where cluster heads are chosen based on the upper threshold distance, lower threshold distance, and remaining energy. LEACHDistance-M is proposed for mobile wireless sensor networks where the selection of cluster heads is based on the upper threshold distance, lower threshold distance, remaining energy, and least mobility.

Hierarchical routing protocols are considered to reduce energy consumption. In this paper, we proposed MMR-LEACH protocol. MMR-LEACH protocol divides WSN into various numbers of cluster layers (i.e., multi-tier) with introducing another node as a Vice Cluster Head (VCH) rather than Main Cluster Head (MCH). In MMR-LEACH, after the selection of MCH, it is responsible to select VCH based on residual energy. In this protocol, MCH is also responsible for collecting, aggregating and transmitting data from sensor nodes to BS and VCH is act as a mediator between lower layer MCH and BS for the transmission purpose. These all results into increase the lifetime of WSN. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Clustering; Hierarchy; Layered clustering; LEACH; MCH; Multi-hop LEACH; Multi-tier; VCH,Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Leaching; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; Hierarchy; Layered clustering; Multi-tier; Multihop; Power management (telecommunication),"Aghera, K.; VVP Engineering CollegeIndia; email: agherakausha@gamil.com",Modi N.Verma P.Trivedi B.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneity-aware Energy-efficient Clustering (HEC) technique which considers two types of heterogeneity  network lifetime and of sensor nodes. Selection of cluster head nodes is done based on the three network lifetime phases: only advanced nodes are allowed to become cluster heads in the initial phase; in the second active phase all nodes are allowed to participate in cluster head selection process with equal probability, and in the last dying out phase, clustering is relaxed by allowing direct transmission. Simulation-based performance analysis of the proposed technique as compared to other relevant techniques shows that HEC achieves longer stable region, improved throughput, and better energy dissipation owing to judicious consumption of additional energy of advanced nodes. On an average, the improvement observed for stability period over LEACH, SEP, FAIR and HEC- with SEP protocols is around 65%, 30%, 15% and 17% respectively. Further, the scalability of proposed technique is tested by varying the field size and number of sensing nodes. The results obtained are found to be quite optimistic. The impact of energy heterogeneity has also been assessed and it is found to improve the stability period though only upto a certain extent. © 2017 KSII.",Clustering; Energy-efficient; Heterogeneity; Phases of network; Stability period; Wireless sensor network,Channel capacity; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-head nodes; Cluster-head selections; Clustering; Energy efficient; Energy Efficient clustering; Heterogeneity; Network stability; Performance analysis; Energy efficiency,"Sharma, S.; IKG Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: sukhwinder.sharma@bbsbec.ac.in",,Korean Society for Internet Information,19767277,,,,English,KSII Trans.

In the proposed protocol called Cooperative relay-based TBF (CBTF), although every forwarder knows the next hop from the packet header, it does not transmit directly to its designated neighbor. Instead it lowers its transmission power so as to send the packet to some intermediate relay nodes, lying close to the trajectory, which, in turn, transmit concurrently the packet to the next forwarder. This forces cooperative relaying between two adjacent forwarders, which avoid direct communication between them. The paper shows analytically that the proposed relay-based method in CTBF is more energy-efficient than the direct forwarding used in TBF. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group.",,Cooperative communication; Energy efficiency; Power management (telecommunication); Relay control systems; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Cooperative relay; Cooperative relaying; Direct communications; Forwarding nodes; Trajectory based forwarding; Trajectory-based; Transmission power; Wireless broadcast; Wireless sensor networks,"Saha, D.; Department of ECE, RCC Institute of Information Technology (RCCIIT)India",Mukherjee S.Bhattacharjee A.K.Deyasi A.Debnath P.,CRC Press/Balkema,,9.78114E+12,,,English,Comput.

Long distance transmission is very expensive in WSNs since power consumption is proportional to d? for transmitting over distance d, where ? is path loss exponent in the interval [2:6]. Thus, there is a necessary requirement of relay nodes in the network that are capable of performing data sensing, data aggregation and data routing, as described in various patents. Method: This paper presents a Layered Relay-Medium Access Control (LR-MAC) Protocol for a Personal Area Network. This protocol introduces the concept of multi-layering for the relay (routing) nodes. The protocol is validated by doing extensive simulations in QualNet 6.1 network simulator. The QoS parameters are analyzed for three different deployment strategies viz. random, grid and circular. Results: The results show that LR-MAC Protocol is an efficient technique in terms of improving network lifetime, average throughput and reducing number of packets dropped due to channel access failure in the network; while LR-MAC gives a neutral performance in terms of end-to-end delay in the network. Conclusion: LR-MAC protocol can efficiently work for random deployments as well as for well-planned effective deployments like in smart building monitoring. The network can also be modified for large areas by increasing number of deployed sensor nodes and keeping node density constant. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Energy efficiency; Energy hole; LR-MAC; Multi-layering; QoS parameters; Relay/routing node; Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Personal communication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Deployment strategy; Energy holes; Extensive simulations; Long distance transmission; Multilayering; QoS parameters; Relay/routing node; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Medium access control,"Thalore, R.; Department of ECE, College of Engineering and Technology, Mody University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: ranjanathalore.cet@modyuniversity.ac.in",,Bentham Science Publishers B.V.,22132759,,,,English,Recent Pat.

The major factor behind the energy consumption inWSN is its data collectionmechanism.The direct data transmission fromeach sensor node to the Base Station (BS) consumes more energy than other alternatives. Also it is unnecessary, due to redundant data transmission because of geographically closer nodes. Clustering is the best data collection architectural model for WSN since it takes care of in-network processing which handles redundant data within the network.The techniques used for the network having uniform node distribution are not suitable for the networks which have nonuniformly distributed nodes. This paper contributes a novel clustering algorithm: Fuzzy Logic Based Energy Efficient Clustering Hierarchy (FLECH) for nonuniformWSN. The clusters in FLECH are created using proper parameters which increases the lifetime of the WSN. Fuzzy logic in FLECH is wisely used to combine important parameters like residual energy, node centrality, and distance to BS for electing best suitable nodes as CH and increases the network lifetime. FLECH performance is verified in different scenarios and the results are compared with LEACH, CHEF, ECPF, EAUCF, and MOFCA.The simulation results clearly indicate the lifetime increase by FLECH over other algorithms and its energy conservation per round of data collection in the network. © 2017 Baranidharan Balakrishnan and Santhi Balachandran.",,Clustering algorithms; Computer circuits; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Architectural modeling; Data collection; Distributed nodes; Energy Efficient clustering; In-network processing; Network lifetime; Node distribution; Real-time application; Wireless sensor networks,"Balakrishnan, B.; School of Computing, SASTRA UniversityIndia; email: baranier85@gmail.com",,Hindawi Limited,15308669,,,,English,Wireless Commun.

All nodes are active and transmit event information to the base station. Due to large number of packet transmission, network gets congested. This causes large number of packet loss. Missing of single packet of information can cause a big event. This paper presents a reliable and fast data transmission protocol for WSN. There are two improvements in this mechanism over previous mechanisms. First is the utilization of packet transmission waiting time and second is adjustment of sending window size according to packet drop ratio.

The clustering algorithm proposed earlier performs clustering on every round basis. On-demand clustering is a recent approach which eradicates the every round based clustering by performing clustering when it is required. But the on-demand clustering approaches proposed so far use equal clustering where clusters are of almost equal size thus, it suffers from the hot spot problem. Therefore, to solve the hot spot problem, a fuzzy logic-based unequal clustering approach is proposed along with an on-demand-based clustering.

One of the major techniques used to prevent from any type of attack in the sensor network is artificial intelligence system (AIS). Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is considered to be the second line of defense, as sensor nodes are first defense line. WSNs are highly vulnerable to intrusions and different types of attacks.

A delay sensitive or emergency event occurrence demands the data delivery on the priority basis over regular monitoring sensing applications. In addition, handling sudden multi-event data and achieving their reliability requirements distinctly becomes the challenge and necessity in the critical situations. To address this problem, this paper presents distributed approach of managing data transmission for simultaneous traffic flows over multi-hop topology, which reduces the load of a sink node; and helps to make a life of the network prolong. For this reason, heterogeneous traffic flows algorithm (CHTF) algorithm classifies the each incoming packets either from source nodes or downstream hop node based on the packet priority and stores them into the respective queues. The PFPS-Earliest Deadline First (PFPS-EDF) and PFPS- First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithms present scheduling for each data packets using priority weight. Furthermore, reporting rate is timely updated based on the queue level considering their fairness index and processing rate. The reported work in this paper is validated in ns2 (ns2.32 allinone) simulator by putting the network into each distinct cases for validation of presented work and real time TestBed.

WSNs suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory, limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture and the use of insecure wireless communication channels. These constraints make security in WSNs a challenge. In this paper, a survey of security issues in WSNs is presented and a new algorithm TESDA is proposed, which is an optimized energy efficient secured data aggregation technic. The cluster head is rotated based on residual energy after each round of aggregation so that network lifetime increases. Based on deviation factor calculated, the trust weight is assigned, if more deviation, then the trust value is less. Simulation results observed by using NS-2.

Ad hoc nature, limited energy, and limited network lifetime are the major reasons that expose WSNs to many security attacks. Intrusion detection is the most important method to intercept all these attacks. In this paper, we propose a new method called Priority Dissection Supervision (PDS) for intrusion detection in WSN. The proposed PDS uses fuzzy logic for prioritizing the impact of distributed intrusion over line of control (LOC). Proposed PDS is a coherent system which models the key elements sensor deployment, intrusion detection, tracking, and priority list. PDS makes use of weight and impact factors which detects the influence field of different types of intruders and accordingly calculates the amount of deterioration. By the use of PDS system the operational and deployment cost can be decreased significantly. Simulation results on MATLAB exhibit the potency and precision of the proposed PDS. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Fuzzy; Intrusion detection; LOC; Priority; WSN,Fuzzy logic; Intrusion detection; MATLAB; Mercury (metal); Deployment costs; Fuzzy; Limited energies; Line of controls; Network lifetime; Priority; Security attacks; Sensor deployment; Wireless sensor networks,"Gupta, A.; Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology, Sector-17, India; email: guptaayushi260894@gmail.com",Bhateja V.Satapathy S.C.Joshi A.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Providing security and tamper resistant hardware to each node is also unrealistic. The compromised nodes can populate network with forged false reports which can cause false alarms and wrong decision making in networks. En-Route filtering is a popular method for filtering false reports in WSNs. Many such filtering techniques have been proposed for filtering false reports based on single sink. In this paper we propose a multi-sink en-route filtering mechanism, which reduces the overall energy consumption of the network. This is achieved by dividing the network into smaller networks and assigning a separate sink to each smaller network. This helps in reducing the hop count of genuine reports, saving lot of energy consumption. The proposed technique also decreases the key-exchange overhead maintaining the same filtering efficiency. The proposed technique also reduces the effect of selective forwarding attack in the network. The simulated results also support our claims and we are able to save up to 40% of energy consumption. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,Decision making; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; En-route filtering; Filtering efficiency; Filtering technique; Selective forwarding attacks; Simulated results; Tamper resistant; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security,"Kumar, A.; Information Security Research Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: alok_21@outlook.com",Martinez Perez G.Gomez Marmol F.Thampi S.M.Westphall C.B.Fan C.I.Hu J.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

Therefore, we propose a deployment strategy that, using the least possible nodes, prolongs network lifetime by avoiding energy holes and also ensures full sensing and communication coverage. The scheme handles the energy imbalance by selecting an appropriate set of communication and sensing ranges for each node based on effective load on that node. After adjusting these ranges, nodes are strategically placed at locations where their energy drains uniformly and thus network lifetime is prolonged. The approach is verified analytically and validated through ns-2 based simulation experiments.

WSNs need to be provided with efficient security features generally due to their deployment in inaccessible terrain and also communication being in the wireless domain. Therefore the question of providing security to such networks arises but the major constraints are the limited resources present in the sensor nodes. Prior importance is given to the energy parameter as it is the most vital component of the sensor nodes. So the objective of any intrusion detection framework would be to design robust mechanisms capable of handling attacks in energy efficient manner. Intrusion detection is used in WSNs because of their ability to detect unknown attacks and finding means to thwart them for preserving energy. Therefore energy efficient intrusion detection has become a significant research area for researchers. Keeping this in mind, we survey the major topics of energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs. The survey work presents topics such as the fundamentals of intrusion detection techniques, as well as the various energy saving mechanisms used in different architectural models. The earlier achievements in energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs are also summarized and existing problems are discussed.

Secure wireless networks must address several issues: data security, node security, key distribution, malicious attacks, node compromise attack, replay attack, etc. Further, many traditional security and authentication models have been implemented on limited wireless nodes with predefined node configuration. Detection and prevention of the security issues in wireless networks with low computational cost has become a major problem in traditional authentication protocols. Therefore, a novel secure authentication mechanism is essential for ensuring the message integrity, security and against attacks. In this paper, a novel message integrity based secured authentication model was implemented on the wireless network topology for secure node communication.

A mobile sink travels across WSN and gathers sensor readings via single-hop communication. To deal with data collection latency in delay-sensitive applications, many proposals have investigated techniques based on Rendezvous Points (RPs) where a mobile sink plans a tour that visits a subset of sensor nodes to collect data within a given deadline. In such a WSN, the number of RPs is limited due to the maximum allowed sink tour length. Therefore, in a large WSN, selected RPs are required to forward a large number of packets, which results in early energy depletion.

Due to limited amount of energy in sensors, the network seeks to attain energy efficient routing for prolonging their lifetime. Existing grid based routing protocols reduce the energy dissipation at nodes, however they suffer from congestion. Network congestion may lead to excessive energy consumption, which in turn minimizes the lifetime of network. In this paper, we propose a new Congestion Aware Lifetime Improving Routing Protocol (abbreviated shortly as CALIRP) for grid-based WSNs, which improves the network lifetime by minimizing congestion at nodes. In CALIRP, routing is conducted in a grid by grid manner through the cell-headers. To save the energy and avoid congestion, multiple routing paths are established from the source to the base station.

As the information from the sensors are transmitted via public network and sensor nodes have limited battery, shift the focus on security and efficiency in WSNs. User authentication is the security task for limiting the access. It is achieved by equipping authorized users with passwords, tokens or biometrics. However, password and token are easy being stolen and forgotten; even biometrics inherit some limitation. More suitable approach is to combine both password and biometric authenticator to harvest benefits in security. This paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs using biohashing. Biohashing facilitates elimination of false accept rates without increasing occurrence of false rejection rate. Additionally, biohashing has highly clear separation of imposter populations and genuine, and zero equal error rate level. The proposed scheme also supports dynamic node addition and user friendly password change mechanism. Using the BAN-logic, we prove that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication. In addition, we simulate proposed scheme for the security against man-in-the middle attack and replay attack using the AVISPA tool, and the simulation results show that our scheme is safe. Through the informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against the known attacks for authentication protocols. © 2016",Authentication; Internet of things (IoT); Wireless sensor networks(WSNs),Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptography; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication and key agreements; Authentication protocols; Biometric authenticators; Internet of Things (IOT); Man in the middle attacks; Mutual authentication; User authentication scheme; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security,"Mishra, D.; Department of Mathematics, LNM Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: dheerendra@maths.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Elsevier B.V.,15708705,,,,English,Ad Hoc Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994417483

But the rapid developments of the wireless sensor networks are still as imperative research topic due to its deployment issues. This work minimises such issues in an energy efficient way by implementing a collision free data aggregation schedule. This article proposes a hybrid algorithm for data aggregation by constructing a collision free data aggregation tree called HCDA that improves the energy utilisation of the sensor nodes. The operation of HCDA is managed by two algorithms: 1) node discovery algorithm (NDA): each node finds its neighbours and chooses their corresponding child nodes to form a two-hop collision free aggregation tree; 2) hybrid data aggregation (HDA): by applying HDA algorithm on NDA aggregation tree, the sink node achieves the fast data aggregation in a collision free topology. The correctness of HCDA is formally proven and approximation and complexities have been analysed. In data aggregation process, the simulation results confirm the higher performance in terms of throughput, delivery ratio and packet delay. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Collision avoidance; Data aggregation; Energy efficiency; Event detection; Scheduling algorithm,Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Network protocols; Network security; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Aggregation trees; Approximation and complexity; Collision-aware; Data aggregation; Data aggregation tree; Energy efficient; Event detection; Hybrid algorithms; Trees (mathematics),"Gopikrishnan, S.; Department of Information Technology, Karpagam College of EngineeringIndia; email: gopikrishnanme@gmail.com",,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,14709503,,,,English,Int.

Obtaining the link state information is more challenging for EH-WSN as different nodes has different energy profiles and state of the node depends on several environmental conditions.

This work explores the reduction in total energy consumption of WSNs using two-hop data aggregation by constructing an energy-efficient data aggregation tree. An adaptive and hybrid routing algorithm for simultaneous data aggregation and exploitation of the data correlation between nodes using a binary search tree framework is proposed. Routes are chosen to minimise the total energy expended by the network based on the shortest response time to the broadcasting request. In this work, a highly secure asymmetric key cryptography algorithm is developed to provide secure data aggregation among the network. The proposed data aggregation approach is used to resolve the relevant energy, delay, collision and security issues. Simulation results show that data aggregation based on the hybrid tree can appreciably reduce the total energy consumption and resolve maximum data aggregation issues in WSNs.

In some specific situations, the sensor field (target) may have coverage gaps due to the random deployment of sensors; hence, the optimized level of target coverage cannot be obtained. Given a set of sensors in the plane, the target coverage problem is to separate the sensor into different groups and provide them specific time intervals, so that the coverage lifetime can be maximized. Here, the constraint is that the network should be connected. Presently, target coverage problem is widely studied due to its lot of practical application in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This paper focuses on target coverage problem along with the minimum energy usage of the network so that the lifetime of the whole network can be increased. Since constructing a minimum connected target coverage problem is known to be NP-Complete, so several heuristics, as well as approximation algorithms, have been proposed. Here, we propose a heuristic for connected target coverage problem in WSN. We compare the performance of our heuristic with the existing heuristic, which states that our algorithm performs better than the existing algorithm for connected target coverage problem. Again, we have implemented the 2-connected target coverage properties for the network which provide fault tolerance as well as robustness to the network. So, we propose one algorithm which gives the target coverage along with 2-connectivity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Minimum spanning tree; Target coverage; Topology control; Wireless sensor Networks,Approximation algorithms; Energy efficiency; Fault tolerance; Optimization; Energy efficient; Minimum spanning trees; Optimized level; Random deployment; Sensor network applications; Target coverage; Target coverage problems; Topology control; Wireless sensor networks,"Bhatta, B.K.; Indian Institute of Technology DelhiIndia; email: bijaya@maths.iitd.ac.in",Murgante B.Apduhan B.O.Borruso G.Cuzzocrea A.Torre C.M.Gervasi O.Taniar D.Stankova E.Rocha A.M.A.C.Misra S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The existing energy based CH selection mechanisms consider that all the participating sensors are trustworthy. Conversely, the trust-based CH selection schemes assume that the sensor nodes are energy efficient. But, these assumptions of energy factor or trust assessment made by the CH selection mechanisms may not be true and the Residual Energy (RE) of the sensors may not be the sole factor to identify an effective CH in a WSN. Hence, this paper presents hybrid integrated energy and trust assessment based forecasting model known as Hyper-geometric Energy Factor based Semi-Markov Prediction Mechanism (HEFSPM) for effective CH election so as to improve the lifetime of the network. From the simulation results, it is inferred that HEFSPM is superior in improving the lifetime of the network to a maximum extent of 22 than the existing CH election mechanisms considered for investigation. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Energy consumption and transmission delay is crucial requirement to be handled to enhance the popularity of WSNs. In order to overcome these issues, we have proposed an Efficient Packet Scheduling Technique for Data Merging in WSNs. Packet scheduling is done by using three levels of priority queue and to reduce the transmission delay. Real-time data packets are placed in high priority queue and Non real-time data packets based on local or remote data are placed on other queues. In this paper, we have used Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme to efficiently determine the priority of the packet at each level and transmit the data packets from lower level to higher level through intermediate nodes. To reduce the number of transmission, efficient data merge technique is used to merge the data packet in intermediate nodes which has same destination node. Data merge utilize the maximum packet size by appending the merged packets with received packets till the maximum packet size or maximum waiting time is reached. Real- time data packets are directly forwarded to the next node without applying data merge. The performance is evaluated under various metrics like packet delivery ratio, packet drop, energy consumption and delay based on changing the number of nodes and transmission rate.

Accuracies of target locations and tracking is calculated from these distance measurements. In this paper we examine effects of varying noise power on the tracking accuracy, effect of cluster size and node density on the target location accuracy. We also focus on energy consumption with respect to change in noise variance and node sensing range. We establish that increase in cluster size improves target tracking accuracy at the cost of increase in energy consumption. Target detection accuracy is dependent on cluster size, node distribution within cluster and also on accuracy of distance measurements. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Cluster; Distance measurement accuracy; Energy efficiency; Target tracking accuracy; Wireless sensor network,Cluster analysis; Clutter (information theory); Distance measurement; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Location; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Detection accuracy; Multiple clusters; Node distribution; Target location; Tracking accuracy; Variable velocities; Within clusters; Target tracking,"Patel, N.; Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Sarvajanik College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: niteen.patel@scet.ac.in",Modi N.Verma P.Trivedi B.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Accurate delivery of sensitive information has direct impact on the overall performance of the system. Achieving reliability and congestion-free communication is important for the WSN. Some urgent data transmission protocol in WSN mainly focuses on transmission of sensitive data only at the same time it neglects the normal data traffic.

The WSAN consists of a huge number of sensors and ample amount of actors. Hence, in the IDMMAC protocol a lightweight channel selection mechanism is proposed to enhance the sensor's lifetime. The IDMMAC protocol divides the beacon interval into two phases (i.e., the adhoc traffic indication message (ATIM) window phase and data transmission phase). When a sensor wants to transmit event information to the actor, it negotiates the maximum packet reception ratio (PRR) and the capacity channel in the ATIM window with its 1-hop sensors. The channel negotiation takes place via a control channel. To improve the packet delivery ratio of the IDMMAC protocol, each actor selects a backup cluster head (BCH) from its cluster members. The BCH is elected based on its residual energy and node degree. The BCH selection phase takes place whenever an actor wants to perform actions in the event area or it leaves the cluster to help a neighbor actor. Furthermore, an interference and throughput aware multichannel MAC protocol is also proposed for actor-actor coordination. An actor selects a minimum interference and maximum throughput channel among the available channels to communicate with the destination actor. The performance of the proposed IDMMAC protocol is analyzed using standard network parameters, such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy dissipation, in the network. The obtained simulation results indicate that the IDMMAC protocol performs well compared to the existing MAC protocols. © 2017 KIPS.",Actor; BCH; IDMMAC; Interference; Multichannel; PRR,Energy dissipation; Medium access control; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wave interference; Wireless sensor networks; Actor; IDMMAC; Minimum interference; Multi-channel MAC protocols; Multichannel; Packet delivery ratio; Packet reception ratios; Wireless sensor and actor networks; Internet protocols,"Kakarla, J.; Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, NIT RourkelaIndia; email: jagadeesh0826@gmail.com",,Korea Information Processing Society,1976913X,,,,English,J.

Sensor nodes communicate with each other to detect events depending on the application, to collect and process data, and to transmit the sensed information to the base station by hopping the data from node to node. Major challenge in wireless network is energy consumption, since the sensor devices are deployed on unattended wide areas and replacing their batteries is not very feasible. Therefore, designing energy-aware algorithms becomes a major challenge for extending the lifetime of sensors. The lifetime of the network can be maximized by selecting the most optimal cluster head. In this paper, a heuristic decision making approach is proposed for producing energy-aware clusters with optimal selection of cluster head.

Most of the protocols consider probability of all the nodes to become CH at the beginning of the network is fixed but the present paper is an approach to consider varying probability of the nodes to become CH at the beginning on the basis of distance from BS.

In this paper, weighted centroid localization algorithm using teaching learning based optimization (WCL-TLBO) is proposed to improve the positioning accuracy in 3D space of WSN. In range-free algorithms, only received signal strength (RSS) information between nodes is sufficient to determine the position of target nodes. RSS value gives the clue to find out the distance between sensor nodes but shows non-linearity between RSS and distance. To overcome this non-linearity, fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used. Edge weights of WCL are modelled using FLS. Further to reduce the errors, TLBO is applied to optimize these edge weights. Simulation results establish the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of localization accuracy to other existing range-free algorithms in similar scenario. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Centroid algorithm; FLS; Range-free localization; TLBO; WSN,Computation theory; Fuzzy logic; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Centroid algorithm; Range free localization; Received signal strength; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Three-dimensional (3D) space; TLBO; Weighted centroid localization algorithms; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,"Sharma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, CVR College of EngineeringIndia; email: ergaurav209@yahoo.co.in",Kharb L.Chahal D.Gupta D.Kaushik S.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

In this work, to address these issues uses of k-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms are investigated for clusters formation and subsequent selection of cluster heads (CHs). For all these newly formed clusters; selection of cluster head is done based on member sensor nodes residual energy status (RES) followed by estimation of Euclidean distances. Depending upon the Euclidean distance measures between the sink node and the estimated energy-centroid (EC) of clusters these clusters are classified into five types. The RES estimation is exercised for all the CHs and sensor nodes (SNs) of the network. Outcomes of simulation results indicate superior performance of fuzzy-c means algorithm compared to k-means algorithm. Further, a case study is presented, wherein the sink is allowed to have some movements in the service area.

With the application of Computational Intelligence (CI) based approaches, various metaheuristics have been developed for energy-efficient clustering in WSNs. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one such metaheuristic which arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs due to its ease of implementation and adaptive nature. However, its solution search equation, which is poor at exploitation process, contributes to its insufficiency. Thus, we present an improved Artificial Bee Colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve its exploitation capabilities. Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student's-t distribution. The proposed metaheuristic maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Student's-t distribution makes it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering protocol BeeCluster based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherits the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads (CHs) and improves energy-efficiency in WSNs.

A limited number of replica detection schemes in mobile WSNs (MWSNs) have been reported till date, where most of them are centralized in nature. The centralized detection schemes use time-location claims and the base station (BS) is solely responsible for detecting replica. Therefore, these schemes are prone to single point of failure. There is also additional communication overhead associated with sending time-location claims to the BS. A distributed detection mechanism is always a preferred solution to the above kind of problems due to significantly lower communication overhead than their counterparts. In this paper, we proposea distributed replica detection scheme for MWSNs. In this scheme, the deviation in the distance traveled by a node and its replica is recorded by the observer nodes. Every node is an observer node for some nodes in the network. Observers are responsible for maintaining a sliding window of recent time-distance broadcast of the nodes. A replica is detected by an observer based on the degree of violation computed from the deviations recorded using the time-distance sliding window. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve higher detection probability compared to distributed replica detection schemes such as Efficient Distributed Detection (EDD) and Multi-Time-Location Storage and Diffusion (MTLSD). © 2017 Alekha Kumar Mishra et al.",,Location; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Centralized detections; Communication overheads; Detection probabilities; Detection scheme; Distributed detection; Preferred solutions; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,"Mishra, A.K.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: alekha.mishra@vit.ac.in",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,15308669,,,,English,Wireless Commun.

In the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), various swarm-based routing protocols have been proposed and the fitness function provides the best possible routing paths.

Bandwidth efficiency, delay constraint and throughput fairness are the primary concerns for maintaining WSN in operation. In this paper, Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) has been proposed for WSN where K-Means clustering algorithm is used for clustering the sensor nodes. The proposed approach produces balanced clusters to ultimately balance the load of cluster heads (CHs) and prolong the network lifetime. It considers residual energy as the parameter in addition to Euclidean distance used in the K-means algorithm for appropriate CH selection. Multi-hop communication from CH nodes to BS takes place relying on their distances from BS.

The advantage of integrating MCC with WMSNs is that the data gathered by sensor nodes can be accessible from anywhere and at anytime by the users. In this context, there exists several issues such as battery life of the multimedia sensors, processing power, and storage etc. To solve these problems, in this work a MCC-WMSNs integration technique is proposed by using a cloudlets based integration algorithm named as CLIW which mainly works with CLIW-1 and CLIW-2 schemes where both the schemes focus on minimizing energy consumption.

Traditional cryptography methods are not supportable in WSNs as they have high energy and resource constraints. Trust management has been proved to be an effective measure to enhance security as well as to handle threats for WSNs. Trust can be defined as level of reliableness in a node. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering (LEACH) is a cluster based routing protocol for WSN which is superior to direct communication protocol and known for its minimum transmission energy. However, LEACH itself has some limitations related to security. In this paper, an energy efficient and trust aware framework for secure routing in LEACH (EETA-LEACH), has been proposed that improves LEACH protocol by introducing trust to provide secure routing, while maintaining originality of LEACH protocol. This approach is a combination of trust-based routing module and trust management module that works together to select trusted Cluster Head (CH). The simulation results demonstrate that proposed scheme is better in terms of network lifetime and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). It is verified that malicious nodes will not be selected as CH and trust value of a malicious node decreases with time. © 2017 SCPE.",Cluster-Based WSNs; LEACH; Trust Management; Wireless Sensor Networks; WSNs,Energy efficiency; Leaching; Military applications; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster-based; Environment monitoring; Minimum transmission energies; Packet delivery ratio; Resource Constraint; Trust management; WSNs; Network security,,,West University of Timisoara,18951767,,,,English,Scalable Comput.

The ultimate challenge of a sensor node is to make the lifetime of the node increase by which the energy consumption is so minimal. This paper addresses a mechanism by which the distance between any source and destination nodes is used by the source nodes to decide whether transmission of the message to destination node must be multi-hop or direct transmission by simply boosting the node power. The network size and the topology are considered for determining the threshold value for the distance based on which the decision is made.

Standard practice in modern times is to agree on symmetric keys using public key protocols. However, public key protocols use heavy computations; rendering them inappropriate for application to low cost devices of Internet of Things (IoT). This led to proposals of various key management strategies for low cost networks; a prominent discovery being key predistribution technique for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)a prototype of IoT. Such schemes require several communicating nodes to share the same cryptographic key. This leads to interesting (combinatorial) graphical models and related optimality problems, that get intense for hierarchical architecture. Most protocols meant for hierarchical (low cost) networks employ separate designs for individual levels and/or clusters. Consequently only local optimal values can be computed. We develop a single universal platform using weighted signed graph (WSG) that designs the entire network for a hierarchical setup. This model can be used as itself or clubbed with a key predistribution scheme (KPS) to enhance the latters security when applied to a WSN. After generic presentation, we combine our universal model with prominent KPS to facilitate comparative study with existing protocols. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.",IoT; Key management; Smart attacks; Weighted signed graph; WSN,Costs; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Public key cryptography; Wireless sensor networks; Hierarchical architectures; Internet of Things (IOT); Key management; Key pre-distribution; Key predistribution scheme; Public-key protocol; Smart attacks; Weighted signed graphs; Network security,"Sarkar, P.; Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: pinakisark@csa.iisc.ernet.in",Deng R.Yegneswaran V.Weng J.Ren K.,Springer Verlag,18678211,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

As data is stored in a regular time interval, massive data is being collected which results in poor data tracking at sink node. To overcome this problem, an online data tracking and estimation (ODTE) algorithm is developed. ODTE algorithm captures continuous data and does online data tracking at regular time interval. It also measures distortion factor (DF) which estimates an optimal data collected at sink node. Moreover, data transmission overhead is another major issue at sink node while transmitting continuous data from sensor nodes. To solve this, we develop data prediction systems (DPS) which allows sensor nodes to transmit data to a sink node within a limit, controlled by a switching operation.
