Contemplation of medical image transmission for various patient’s information using MC-CDMA system through wireless media is discussed. Arnold cat map encryption algorithm is ensured to enhance the image transmission securely. At each mobile station, transmitted bit stream of encrypted images is estimated using minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) algorithm. The picture quality is ensured at the receiver by adopting super resolution through sparse technique. The performance of considered system through stanford channel model specification is illustrated. PSNR metric is also considered for image transmission. From the analysis, it is observed that considered MC-CDMA system with encryption algorithm and sparse based super resolution technique mitigates multi-user interference effects while retaining the quality of individual medical images.

The proposed algorithm is highly modular and generic so that the DDC can decimate by any fractional ratio i.e. the ADC sampling rate may be any integer or non-integer multiple of output sample rate from DDC. The algorithm is verified by evaluating the bit error rate(BER) performance of Binary Phase Shift Keying(BPSK) modulation with theoretical BER in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in Matlab. Xilinx FPGA (Kintex-7) realizes the novel DDC hardware along with the demodulator implemented in DSP processor which performs timing synchronization, frequency offset estimation and correction.

For this, LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) technology is standardized in 3GPP Release 12. The use of coexistence mechanism such as Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) can help protecting the quality of service of mobile users operating in the WiFi band by guaranteeing them channel access. Additionally, allocation of wireless resources to each mobile user in the WiFi band should be controlled to facilitate interference-free transmissions to other mobile users in the same band. In this paper, we propose two resource allocation techniques for femtocell networks which efficiently allocate resources such as spectrum and transmit power among competing mobile users in the LTE and WiFi bands. For the LTE band, we propose the use of spreading based spectrum and power allocation, and model the throughput of femtocells using a non-cooperative game theoretic framework. To improve the co-existence performance of femtocells operating in the WiFi band, we propose a Q-leaning based resource allocation technique for femtocell transmit power and duty cycle calculation. In a scenario where multiple base stations are available for user-base station association, considering only the signal strength to make association decision is not an optimal approach, specially when user load and available resources at base stations vary significantly with time. Considering this, we suggest a cell selection scheme that assigns mobile users to femtocells considering the bitrate they are expected to receive in both LTE and WiFi bands. Our resource allocation techniques, when combined with the proposed cell selection scheme, show a minimum improvement of 23.4% in network throughput and 19.6% reduction in energy consumption. This, in turn, also improves the energy efficiency of the network by at least 35%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cell selection; Energy efficiency; LTE-U femtocell network; Spectrum and power allocation; Spreading","Base stations; Cells; Cytology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Femtocell; Game theory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Cell selection; Duty-cycle calculations; Femtocell Networks; Noncooperative game; Optimal approaches; Power allocations; Resource allocation techniques; Spreading; Wireless telecommunication systems","Thakur, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, 600036, India; email: rahult@cse.iitm.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

Active research has been ongoing to mitigate the impact of these catastrophes and preclude the economic losses. The existing methods that utilize pre-event and post-event images not only require the immediate and guaranteed availability of the appropriate data set but are also encumbered by manual mapping of the images, necessitating the indication of corresponding control points in the two images. This paper highlights the use of only post-event imagery in the absence of reference data to achieve a more timely delivery to produce damage maps as the output. This eliminates the need for manual georeferencing of images. Our method incorporates simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) for segmenting the images into uniform superpixels and extraction of 62 features for each superpixel. We used various classifiers of which Random Forest classifier was found to give a comparatively high accuracy of 90.4% over others. To enumerate the accuracy of the method proposed, we used 1500 data regions of which 20% were used for testing, and 80% were used for training. The aerial images taken by GeoEye1 after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami are utilized in this study to detect building damage. In the case of availability of ground truth, we compare the histograms of the pre- and post-imagery to quantify similarity as the SSD (Sum of Squared Distances) value and thus, our approach produces an assessment as an output map displaying the extent of damage in the area covered by each superpixel. We consider 6 levels of damage ranging from 1 to 6, where 1 signifies no damage, and 6, maximum damage. © 2017 IEEE.","Damage Assessment; Image Processing; Random Forest Classifier; Segmentation; Texture Features","Antennas; Decision trees; Disasters; Earthquakes; Image processing; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Losses; Pixels; Satellite imagery; Superpixels; Tsunamis; 2011 Christchurch earthquakes; Corresponding control points; Damage assessments; Damage Identification; Devastating effects; Random forest classifier; Simple Linear Iterative Clustering; Texture features; Damage detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509060467,,,"English","GHTC - IEEE Glob.

The M-band wavelet transform captures the texture of the underwater image by decomposing the image into sub bands with different scales and orientations. The proper sub bands for segmentation are selected depending on the HVS. The HVS imitates the original visual technique of a human being and it is used to divide each sub band into Weber, De-Vries Rose and Saturation regions. A sub band is selected for segmentation depending on those three regions.

The eminent need of mining is useful to extract the hidden pattern from the wide availability of vast amount of data. Clustering is one such useful mining tool to handle this unfavorable situation by carrying out crucial steps refers as cluster analysis. It is the process of a grouping of patterns into clusters based on similarity. Partition based clustering algorithms are widely accepted for much diverse application such as pattern analysis, image segmentation, identification system. Among the different variations of the partition based clustering, due to its monotony and ease of implementation K-means algorithm gained a lot of attraction in the various field of research. A severe problem associated with the algorithm is that it is highly sophisticated while selecting the initial centroid and may converge to a local optimum solution of the criterion function value if the initial centroid is not chosen accurately. Additionally, it requires the prior information regarding a number of clusters to be formed and the computation of K-means are expensive. K-means algorithm is a two-step process includes initialization and assignment step. This paper works on initialization step of the algorithm and proposed an efficient enhanced K-means clustering algorithm which eliminates the deficiency of the existing one.

We propose a Rényi Divergence based Covariance Matching Pursuit (RD-CMP) algorithm which recovers the common support of the joint sparse signals as the hyperparameters of a joint sparsity inducing Gaussian signal prior. The support hyperparameters are learned as a set variable by solving a reverse information projection problem based on the α-Rényi information divergence. We show that the α-Rényi divergence objective can be expressed as a difference of two submodular functions, and propose an iterative majorization-minimization procedure to minimize the objective, with each iteration involving a greedy optimization. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed RD-CMP algorithm is capable of recovering k-sparse support from fewer than k measurements per signal. Compared with existing covariance matching based joint sparse support recovery methods, RD-CMP is empirically shown to be several times faster in execution. © 2017 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; Covariance matching; Joint sparsity; Multiple measurement vector problem; Rényi divergence; Sparse Bayesian learning; Submodularity","Compressed sensing; Iterative methods; Optimization; Recovery; Wireless telecommunication systems; Covariance matching; Joint sparsity; Multiple measurement vector problems; Sparse Bayesian learning; Submodularity; Signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030088,,,"English","IEEE Workshop Signal Process.

The proposed design has incorporated a single sided FR-4 substrate with one square and two-crossed shaped loops which led to triple band reject (1.8 GHz, 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz) characteristics. The FR-4 substrate has a dielectric constant of 4.4 with loss tangent of 0.02 and dimension of 0.12 λ × 0.12 λ. The projected FSS design is polarization independent due to symmetrical structure. Therefore, it has produced a stable resonant frequency response at normal and oblique angles of incidences for both perpendicular TE and parallel TM wave modes. This stability of designed FSS has verified by its simulated results and realized in CST Microwave studio in frequency domain solver based on FDTD method. The transmission and reflection characteristics have analyzed at the selected band-stop/notch frequencies 1.8 GHz, 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz.

Compression methods which are capable of maintaining high quality information for important parts without any significant loss prove as useful techniques in such cases. Medical images contain large amount of data and need compression for efficient storage and communication purposes. On the other hand medical images also have a few diagnostically important regions where loss of quality could result in wrong interpretation which cannot be tolerated. Thus compression techniques which provide both lossless as well as lossy compression in different areas of the same image can provide a solution for the medical community. As digital images are in matrix form we have developed a mathematical approach for applying both lossless and lossy compression on the same image. Mathematical operations like matrix subtraction, addition, multiplication and other matrix operations can help to achieve the result of maintaining high quality at the region of interest (ROI) and allow high degree of compression in other regions. Here we have achieved the two objectives of reducing the storage and transmission time as well as retaining the original quality at the ROI successfully. © 2017 IEEE.","Compression techniques; Matrix mathematical operations; Region of interest; Wavelet compression","Digital storage; Image segmentation; Matrix algebra; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Compression methods; Compression techniques; High quality information; Mathematical approach; Mathematical operations; Region of interest; The region of interest (ROI); Wavelet compression; Image compression",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In this paper, we consider MBM for the uplink of a massive MIMO system, which has not been reported before. Each user is equipped with one transmit antenna with multiple radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) placed near it. The base station (BS) is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive antennas. We investigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) in a massive MIMO setting. Our results show that multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) can significantly outperform other modulation schemes. For example, a bit error performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the BS in a massive MIMO system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas using MU-MBM. Even multiuser spatial modulation and generalized spatial modulation in the same massive MIMO settings require more than 200 antennas to achieve the same bit error performance. Also, recognizing that the MU-MBM signal vectors are inherently sparse, we propose an efficient MU-MBM signal detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), and subspace pursuit (SP). © 2017 IEEE.","CoSaMP; Massive MIMO; Media-based modulation; OMP; RF mirrors; Sparse recovery; Subspace pursuit","Compressed sensing; MIMO systems; Mirrors; Receiving antennas; Signal processing; Vectors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Compressive sampling matching pursuits; CoSaMP; Massive MIMO; Massive MIMO systems; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Reconstruction algorithms; Sparse recovery; Subspace pursuits; Modulation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030088,,,"English","IEEE Workshop Signal Process.

Usually SI is suppressed by reconstructing it using the transmit signal and subtracting it at the FD receiver. For good cancellation, an accurate estimate of the SI channel is essential. However, training for obtaining the SI channel in the presence of intended received signal requires a large training period. This can be addressed by designating a separate training period during which received signal is turned off, and the SI channel is estimated. However having a separate training period impacts the overall achievable rate. In this paper, we propose a technique that exploits the structure of the received signal to train for SI channel in the presence of received signal. Specifically, we propose a time domain symmetric preamble packet in the received signal to create effective samples in which the received signal is absent. Further, we bound the variance of the channel estimates thus obtained and observe that the performance is same as that of having a separate training period. The performance of the proposed technique is also evaluated by an experiment setup. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Finite difference method; Separation; Signal interference; Signal processing; Time domain analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channel estimate; Experiment set-up; Full-duplex; Full-duplex radios; Received signals; Self-interferences; Time domain; Signal receivers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030088,,,"English","IEEE Workshop Signal Process.

In this work, we proposed an idea for feasible communication between hearing impaired and normal person with the help of machine learning approach. Instead of preprocessing techniques, like filtering and segmentation of hand patch images, we extract features from our dataset by discrete wavelet transform. The dimension of the feature vector is reduced by linear discriminant analysis. Both linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) are used on the basis of tenfold classification to recognition sign language symbols. This work ensures the 97.3% accuracy on random sign symbolic dataset of gestural communication. © 2017 IEEE.","American Sign Language(ASL); Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT); Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA); Sign Language Recognition (SLR); Support Vector Machine(SVM)","Discrete wavelet transforms; Discriminant analysis; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Signal reconstruction; Support vector machines; American sign language; Gestural communication; Linear discriminant analyses (LDA); Linear discriminant analysis; Machine learning approaches; Preprocessing techniques; Sign Language recognition; Symbolic expression; Audition","Kumar, N.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: atrindma@iitr.ac.in","Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In this paper, a heart sound segmentation algorithm for segmenting S1 and S2 heart sound which corresponds to the systolic and diastolic activity of the heart is presented. The proposed method is based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm. The recorded PCG is decomposed into various modes using VMD. A novel criterion is proposed to select an appropriate mode which is based on center frequency and relative energy. Then the Shannon entropy envelope of the selected mode is computed. S1 and S2 heart sound is segmented by applying dynamic threshold on the Shannon entropy envelope. The segmentation algorithm is tested on both available standard database (Physionet, Pascal, Michigan, and eGeneralMedical) and recorded signal.

Ultrasound (US) imaging is much less expensive compared to CT/MR imaging. Also US imaging has no ionizing radiation and is harmless and noninvasive. Elasticity of the artery and intima-media thickness (IMT) are two important parameters which are used for diagnosing CVDs at an early stage in an individual.

We Firstly extracted the exudates from fundus image then applying NEBF. NEBF is an inpainting filter which is used to inpaint exudates so that false positives are reduced in image. The ACO is applied based on segmentation. The proposed method is tested on DRIVE database. This provides us with better results over the existing methods even in the case when low depth of images. © 2017 IEEE.","ACO; Fundus images; NEBF; Retinal Vessel Segmentation","Artificial intelligence; Eye protection; Image segmentation; Ophthalmology; Diabetic retinopathy; False positive; Fundus image; Low-intensity; NEBF; Neighbourhood; Retinal vessel segmentations; Vessel segmentation; Image enhancement",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

For this, we introduce two different methods dBValue and dAValue to handle the scenario. A concept of Relenting Factor (R) is used to incorporate the compromise defined by DM. An elitist archive is implemented which is periodically filtered on the basis of dBValue or dAValue techniques to filter out best individuals for each generation.

In order to accurately recognize the hyperbola signatures, a novel approach called a Distinctive Similarity Rendering Approach (DSRA) is applied to GPR images. This approach includes five steps. First, the GPR B-scan image is pre-processed by pattern profile method to extract the symmetrical open curves for cone presence. Second, the detected open cone curve components were enhanced by target focussing technique to build the close cone curve signatures to result the best hyperbola signature fit. Third, the processed GPR B-scan image results the best fit hyperbola signatures, these signatures are further processed using our proposed similarity rendering approach, to reconstitute the further hyperbola apices and for the detection of all hyperbola signatures in GPR B-scan image. Fourth, then we use sample hyperbola shape signatures with varying hyperbola cone radius (Cr) to locate the hyperbola apices from the spurious reflections of all hyperbola region of interest detected. To find the hyperbola apices, a Hough transform is used in the similarity rendering area. Finally, we estimate all the hyperbola shape signatures of target object reflections.

The traditional threshold-based or region growing methods tends to fail when dense pathology is present in the lung field. In such cases, it is found that prior shape knowledge increases the efficiency and accuracy of segmentation. The main contribution of this paper is the automated segmentation of lung field from HRCT images. The method is based on active shape model and it is able to segment the lung fields from HRCT images with various pathological regions like honeycomb, cavity, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation etc. Multiple atlases of the the lung fields are created using training data of size 100 for both left and right lungs. These atlases are used for the training of active shape model for estimation of lung shape fields. In this paper, after training, the seed selection part is automated in the matching step to ensure minimal human intervention. The result of segmentation is evaluated in terms of the Jaccard index, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD) for 80 HRCT slices from a publicly available database.

If some or all neighboring pixels form a convex region of same gray level intensity, then there exists an edge. In order to distinguish between different level of intensities in edge detection, a threshold is required which is usually different for different type of images due to variation in level of intensities. This paper proposes and compares two methods namely global and local thresholding to model the value of threshold through quantitative empirical method for cellular logic array processing based edge detection method. The performance of the modeled algorithms is measured by F1-score, recall-precision break-even-points and performance ratio. Experimental results show that the local thresholding approach gives slightly better F1-score and performance ratio for all scenarios of six Berkeley Segmentation Database images and respective ground truths. It has also been found that best percentage of threshold value can be determined in a better way by break-even-point rather than by best F1-score.

The spatially sparse MIMO channel is modeled in terms of the basis array response matrices corresponding to the quantized directional cosines at the transmit and receive antenna arrays followed by the development of an expectation maximization (EM)-based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) channel estimation approach. Subsequently, an enhanced variant of the SBL scheme is proposed based on hard thresholding the associated hyperparameter estimates, which is observed to significantly improve the accuracy of channel estimation. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) is also derived to benchmark the accuracy of the proposed SBL-based channel estimation schemes. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance improvement achieved in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based sparse mmWave channel estimation scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound; Channel estimation; Millimeter wave; Sparse Bayesian learning","Antenna arrays; Maximum principle; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Receiving antennas; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Accuracy of channel estimation; Bayesian; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Multiple-input multiple-output channels; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Performance improvements; Sparse Bayesian learning; Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL); Channel estimation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030088,,,"English","IEEE Workshop Signal Process.

In this paper, we use class labels to learn a Mahalanobis distance in the embedded feature vector space and show performance improvements over the default Euclidean metric in both retrieval and classification tasks.

The design problem is usually formulated into a maximization of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), subject to waveform constraints. A widely used approach is the alternating optimization scheme combined with the rank-one constrained SDP programming. In this paper, a new algorithm based on the majorization-minimization (MM) method is proposed. This algorithm is not only capable of dealing with various waveform constraints, but also computationally efficient.

The popularity and need of video surveillance at residential, Industrial, public and business locations have supported the widespread use of vision based fire detection system. The colour of fire is the basic technique for identification of fire in an image. However, the colour of fire varies from red, orange, yellow to white. Also, there are non-fire objects with fire-like colour. In order to improve the accuracy of fire detection system, colour detection is combined with various other techniques. Edge detection, motion detection, area covered by flames, existence of smoke, growth of fire and background segmentation are some techniques which are combined by various researchers and used to correctly classify the fire images and fire-like non fire images in a video. There are also various thresholds that are used to differentiate fire in any frame. These thresholds need to be adjusted based on the type of area and its brightness level. Also, the difference in the subsequent frames and area covered by the flames supports the existence of fire if it is greater than the threshold.

Not only storage, but high speed read and writes of the data is also essentially important for performance. Cloud Computing, now a days, solves this problem and gives the most efficient solutions especially for storage and computing needs. Though different cloud service providers offer different services, but the challenges of cost effective storage of data and its fast retrieval still remains an objection. Several different solutions are available for meeting this problem, yet there is a provocation to make these solutions more effective. There are some algorithms for segmentation and filtering of databases, but when the question comes to large data sets (for example data storage and processing for billions of rows) the performance is however compromised. This paper discusses the main concerns that relate to the effective filtering, storage and segmentation of the data. Focus is placed on the software application (IOTA) which is being developed by us which is intended to addresses all the stated concerns and how different modules in the software work together to deliver seamless service. © 2017 IEEE.","API; big-data; cloud; data storage; filtering; GCP (Google Cloud Platform); LibPhone; NoSQL; segmentation; servers","Application programs; Clouds; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Digital storage; Filtration; Image segmentation; Servers; Cloud platforms; Cloud service providers; Cost-effective storages; Data storage; Different services; LibPhone; NoSQL; Software applications; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

Because of these increase in services, medical staff faces with more and more challenges. To improve the quality of patient's life, wireless technology allows doctors to monitor patient's health condition remotely and gives them timely health information reminder anywhere anytime. The recent advanced biomedical sensors technology (i.e. wearable sensor), low-power integrated circuit and wireless communications have allowed the implementation of low-cost, small size and efficient physiological wearable sensor nodes. In this paper the advanced system contains the sensor nodes such as heart rate sensor and temperature sensor; these are capable of sensing the analog biomedical signal. These signals are then processed by using Arduino board and the processed data is integrated before transmitting. The information is continuously sent to the server through Zigbee network. At the receiver side, the collected information is analysed by the doctor. If any abnormal condition found in patients health than immediately alert system comes into action. This is performed by sending a stored message to the respective doctors of particular patient using GSM module. With the help of Zigbee transceivers and GSM module doctors monitor the patient's health continuously. This gives the efficiency and services in medical sector. © 2017 IEEE.","Arduino board; Heart rate sensor; PDA; Temperature sensor LM35; Zigbee and GSM model-MGSM901","Biosensors; Global system for mobile communications; Health; Heart; Low power electronics; Patient monitoring; Personal digital assistants; Radio transceivers; Sensor nodes; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Zigbee; Arduino; Body temperature measurements; GSM models; Health informations; Heart rate sensors; Wireless communications; Wireless instruments; Wireless technologies; Wearable sensors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

This implements an evolved node base station (eNB). The Integrated eNB's in 4G network are responsible for seamless switching between different technologies and channels. Such a switching decision is often affected by several parameters like available bandwidth, desired load, inter channel interference, available signal to noise ratio, fading, downlink power and so on. Regular switching between channels result in waste of a portion of bandwidth in control signal whereas delayed switching results in low packet delivery ratio and in turn low data rate. Hence, an optimal solution is desired to maintain high data rate under scalable 4G network. In this work, we propose an optimal resource allocation and power allocation using a Feed Forward Neural Network based machine learning framework for channel condition classification. The system is trained with probe packets under controlled conditions. The eNB nodes then manage the channel resources based on resource constraints during communication of performance parameters. Results shows that the proposed system improves effective data rate and packet delivery ratio in comparison with conventional linear techniques. © 2017 IEEE.","eNB; LTE; Neural network and resource allocation","4G mobile communication systems; Bandwidth; Heterogeneous networks; Learning systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Queueing networks; Resource allocation; Satellite communication systems; Signal to noise ratio; Switching; Controlled conditions; Interchannel interference; Long term evolution networks; LTE heterogeneous networks; Optimal resource allocation; Packet delivery ratio; Performance parameters; Resource allocation schemes; Wireless telecommunication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

The best way to improve the patient’s chances for survival is the early detection of potentially cancerous cells. But, the conventional systems fails to segment the cancerous cells of various types namely, well-circumscribed, juxta-pleural, juxta-vascular and pleural-tail at its early stage (i.e., less than 3 mm) that leads to less classification accuracy. It is also noted that none of the existing systems achieved accuracy more than 98%. In this paper, we propose an optimal diagnosis system not only for early detection of lung cancer nodules and also to improve the accuracy in Fog computing environment. The Fog environment is used for storage of the high volume CT scanned images to achieve high privacy, low latency and mobility support. In our approach, for the accurate segmentation of Region of Interest (ROI), the hybrid technique namely Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and region growing segmentation algorithms are used. Then, the important features of the nodule of interest such as geometric, texture and statistical or intensity features are extracted. From the above extracted features, the optimal features used for the classification of lung cancer are identified using the Cuckoo search optimization algorithm. Finally, the SVM classifier is trained using these optimal features, which in turn helps us to classify the lung cancer as either of type benign or malignant. The accuracy of the proposed system is tested using Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP) public database CT lung images. The total sensitivity and specificity attained in our system for the above said database are 98.13 and 98.79% respectively. This results in a mean accuracy of 98.51% for training and testing in a sample of 103 nodules occurring in 50 exams. The rate of false positives per exam was 0.109. Also, a high receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.9962 has been achieved. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature","Cuckoo search optimization algorithm; Fog computing; Fuzzy C-means; Region growing segmentation; SVM classifier","Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Diseases; Fog; Fog computing; Fuzzy systems; Image segmentation; Optimization; Software testing; Support vector machines; Cuckoo searches; Fuzzy C mean; Receiver operating characteristics; Region growing; Segmentation algorithms; Sensitivity and specificity; Support vector machine classifiers; SVM classifiers; Classification (of information)","Prabukumar, M.; School of Information Technology and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: mprabukumar@vit.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",18685137,,,,"English","J.

Most of the work reported in the literature employs deterministic method to model the channel. Since deterministic method is site specific and results into complex models and therefore is not practically viable to model a general wireless communication channel. This paper discusses the estimation of the parameters of the channel like path loss, doppler frequency shift and phase shift using deterministic and stochastic methods for sum of sinusoids model of the wireless multipath channel. The results are compared for both deterministic and stochastic models for different multipath channels and found that stochastic method of implementing sum of sinusoids model results in low bit error rate.

To reduce the accidents sharing of the vehicle's dynamics information is essential. The primary vehicle uses several sensors to collect information which were transmitted to the next subordinate vehicles that follow it. For communicating huge data between vehicles we need a Multiple Input Multiple Output Radio Frequency (MIMO-RF) transceiver which leads to increase in complexity and cost of vehicle design. This drawback can be overcome by using the existing Visible Light Communication (VLC), because of the accessibility of light source and probability of seamless communication. In this paper, a Light Emitting Array (LEA) setup is likely to be placed which is the Region of Interest (ROI). The comparative distance between the camera and the LEA varies dynamically that leads to increase in average Bit Error Rate (BER) at the output of the detector. To overcome this problem, we proposed the Kalman filter methodology along with regular geometry techniques to locate and track the LEA and the deformed shape of LEA is corrected utilizing perspective projection that maximizes the average BER performance. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has an optimum performance than the existing method. © 2017 IEEE.","Kalman filter; Light Emitting Array; Perspective projection; Region of Interest; Visible Light Communication","Accidents; Bit error rate; Error statistics; Image segmentation; Kalman filters; Light; Light emission; Light sources; Microelectronics; MIMO systems; Vehicles; Visible light communication; Average bit-error rates; Light-emitting arrays; Optimum performance; Perspective projections; Region of interest; Seamless communication; The region of interest (ROI); Visible light communications (VLC); Vehicle to vehicle communications",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538617168,,,"English","Int.

With the help of multiple wireless technologies, the vehicles are able to talk with road side units (RSU) and also with other neighboring vehicles. In this scenario, if a vehicle moves from one coverage area which is supported by one network to other coverage area then the ongoing communication should be carried over, which is possible with the help of vertical handover (VHO) techniques. In this paper, a new method for handover necessity estimation is done using traveling time calculation, and threshold time prediction. The main objective is to increase the connectivity time by reducing the handover failure rate and unnecessary handover rate.

The error correcting capability of any encoding technique depends on the number of parity bits added and position, where the parity bits are placed. Low density parity check code having sparse parity check matrix provides the ability to reach near the Shannon limit over the fading and non-fading channel. In this paper, the impact of LDPC Code on the performance of communication system over various channel are analyzed by considering different modulation scheme, Eb/No value, size of signal constellation and code rate. The value of code rate less than or equal to 2/3, LDPC Code acquires the negligible bit error rate regarding the minimum value of Eb/No (8.5 dB) and maximum value of size of signal constellation (16) with PSK modulation scheme. The obtained results are useful to improve the performance and proper utilization of power and bandwidth in wireless communication application. © 2017 IEEE.","AWGN channels; Bit error rate; Iterative decoding; LDPC Code; Phase shift keying; Rayleigh channels; Signal to Noise ratio","Channel coding; Codes (symbols); Errors; Fading channels; Forward error correction; Iterative decoding; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Modulation; Multimedia services; Phase shift keying; Satellite communication systems; Signal encoding; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; AWGN channel; Error detection and correction coding; LDPC codes; Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes; Rayleigh channel; Sparse parity-check matrices; Wireless communication applications; Wireless communications; Bit error rate",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

MANET is simple and effective wireless technology which depends on mutual trust for communication. Due to limited processing and energy power, developers used the lightweight protocol to build it. This made developers concentrate on basic functionality (like routing, route discovery) and less on security aspects. One of its examples is mutual trust between nodes. In MANET, nodes are interdependent for communication as well as data transmission which need mutual trust between nodes. This mutual trust flaw is exploited by attackers to perform a different kind of attacks by injecting malicious node in the network. One of these attacks is blackhole attack. In this study, the behavior of blackhole attack is discussed and have proposed a lightweight solution for blackhole attack which uses existing functions.

Both are important competencies for mobile robots and have each received significant attention in the robotics and computer vision community, but usually as separate areas of investigation. In this paper, we leverage the powerful complementary nature of place recognition and place categorization processes to create a new hybrid place recognition system that uses place context to inform place recognition. We show that semantic place categorization creates an informative natural segmenting of physical space that in turn enables significantly better place recognition performance in comparison to existing techniques. In particular, this new semantically-informed approach adds robustness to significant local changes within the environment, such as transitioning between indoor and outdoor environments or between dark and light rooms in a house, complementing the capabilities of current condition-invariant techniques that are robust to globally consistent change (such as day to night cycles). We perform experiments using 4 novel benchmark datasets and show that semantically-informed place recognition outperforms the previous state-of-the-art systems. Like it does for object recognition [1], we believe that semantics can play a key role in boosting conventional place recognition and navigation performance for robotic systems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Image segmentation; Intelligent robots; Object recognition; Robotics; Robots; Semantics; Benchmark datasets; Navigation performance; Outdoor environment; Place recognition; Robotic systems; Specific location; State-of-the-art system; Vision communities; Computer vision",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21530858,9781538626825,85RBA,,"English","IEEE Int Conf Intell Rob Syst",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032259618

Characteristic modes of Chassis has been analyzed, it has been observed that only one mode is resonating around 1GHz. To enable more than one characteristic mode to resonate around 1GHz, Two metal strips are attached along the length of the chassis with the help of shorting pins. A new characteristic mode has been enabled at about 900 MHz due to this modification. In order to obtain characteristic mode at further lower frequency, the newly attached metal strip is meandered. A shift in the characteristic mode has been observed due to this. Afterwards, Dual antenna design is proposed. The Dual antenna consists of metal strip antenna and coupled antenna. The feeding method is proposed with the help of theory of characteristic mode (TCM) to excite the antenna chassis mode and metal strip mode efficiently. The results shows that the strip antenna covers 849-953MHz (LTE Band8) and chassis mode antenna covers frequency 950-1120 MHz. © 2017 IEEE.","Antenna; LTE; mobile antenna; multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems; mutual coupling; TCM","Antennas; Chassis; Communication channels (information theory); Hand held computers; Metals; MIMO systems; Mobile antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Characteristic modes; Coupled antennas; Dual antennas; Hand held device; Lower frequencies; MIMO applications; Mutual coupling; Strip antennas; Strip metal",,"Sundararaju Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049967,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

This method is preferred due to its fastness and easy imaging and also inexpensive nature. The X-ray imaging couldn't show a small cancer and blood clot in chest, it works fine to categorize TB. But the accuracy of disease diagnostics depends on the ability of practitioner owing to lack of automatic approach.

Clinically, it was proved that there is a progressive decline in cognition, memory, and social functioning due to deposition of different types of protein in the brain. Traditional decision making systems are more manual in nature and ultimate conclusion in terms of exact prognosis is remote. Recently, under certain investigations neurological degradation occurs in the retina of the eye as well as the brain. Also it is clearly investigated that are some parameter changes on the retina of the eye of the AD patients. Therefore eye provides a transparent medium to neuropathology which initiated the development of ocular biomarkers for AD. Retinal imaging and visual testing potentially improves disease management and quality of life for AD patients as they are non invasive methods. Any disease modifying treatments which are developed are most possibly to be achieving success if initiated early in the process, and this needs that we tend to develop reliable, validated and economical ways to diagnose AD. Profiling of human body parameter using computers can be utilized for the early prognosis of AD. There are several imaging techniques used in clinical practice for the prognosis of Alzheimer's type pathology. In this paper we have focused on the fundus imaging, a type of retinal imaging that can be used for the early prognosis of AD. For that we have proposed a new scheme based on Fixed-Grid Wavelet Networks (FGWN) for the segmentation of fundus retinal images that can be used for diagnosing AD. © 2017 IEEE.","Alzheimer Disease; Fixed-Grid Wavelet Networks; Fundus Imaging; Sombrero","Aldehydes; Decision making; Image segmentation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ophthalmology; Alzheimer disease; Alzheimer's disease; Decision-making systems; Disease management; Fundus imaging; Noninvasive methods; Sombrero; Wavelet network; Diagnosis",,"Sundararaju Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049967,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In UDN scenario, conditions of the channels operating in licensed band may exhibit intermittent characteristics due to the varying level of interference received from large number of nearby access networks. On the other hand, channel conditions in unlicensed band may fluctuate drastically due to the interference caused by the co-existence of long term evolution (LTE-U) and wireless local area network (WLAN) in unlicensed band. The traditional handover mechanisms rely on the instantaneous assessments of link qualities such as RSS and SINR. The target network selected based on such instantaneous values may not be the appropriate one when the actual handover is executed.

To provide fault tolerance and scalable performance, the virtualized network functions are typically built in a clustered architecture, with a front-end load balancer distributing incoming traffic across multiple replicas, and the replicas synchronizing shared state with each other for resilience and consistency. Our work compares several distributed designs of the LTE EPC along the axis of the frequency of state synchronization across the replicas, and quantifies the performance overhead of state synchronization for control plane and data plane operations. Using experiments with our distributed EPC prototypes, we show that synchronizing state for every message incurs a prohibitive performance penalty (over 70% reduction in throughput as compared to the case of no synchronization). On the other hand, synchronizing state at session boundaries, while providing lower fault tolerance guarantees, imposes a smaller performance penalty. We believe that our open-source prototypes and experimental results will guide future distributed EPC designs, and help operators pick the right design that is appropriate for their fault tolerance and performance requirements. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Fault tolerance; Hardware; Open source software; Software defined networking; Synchronization; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clustered architectures; Commodity hardware; Distributed design; Performance comparison; Performance penalties; Performance requirements; Scalable performance; State synchronization; Network function virtualization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538632857,,,"English","IEEE Conf.

Image enhancement algorithms focus on improving the human image perception. More specifically, contrast and brightness enhancement is considered as a key processing step prior to any further image analysis like segmentation, feature extraction, etc. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are used effectively for the past few decades, for solving such complex image processing problems. In this paper, a modified differential Modified Differential Evolution (MDE) algorithm for contrast and brightness enhancement of satellite images is proposed. The proposed algorithm is developed with exploration phase by differential evolution algorithm and exploitation phase by cuckoo search algorithm. The proposed algorithm is used to maximize a defined fitness function so as to enhance the entropy, standard deviation and edge details of an image by adjusting a set of parameters to remodel a global transformation function subjective to each of the image being processed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with ten recent state-of-the-art enhancement algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm in enhancing satellite images and natural scenes effectively. Objective evaluation of the compared methods was done using several full-reference and no-reference performance metrics. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results proves that the proposed MDE algorithm outperforms others to a greater extend. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cuckoo search algorithm; Differential evolution algorithm; Image enhancement; Metaheuristics; Satellite images","Edge detection; Function evaluation; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Luminance; Optimization; Satellites; Cuckoo search algorithms; Differential evolution algorithms; Image enhancement algorithm; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Modified differential evolution; Modified differential evolution algorithms; Satellite images; Evolutionary algorithms","Lal, S.; Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India; email: shyam.mtec@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

The development of this methodology is based on deep learning strategies that model the presence of the tumour tissues with level sets. It is difficult to robustly segment mammogram image due to low contrast between normal and lesion tissues. Therefore, Chan-Vese level set method is used to extract the initial contour of mammograms and deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) algorithm is used to learn the features of mammary-specific mass and microcalcification clusters. To increase the classification accuracy and reduce the false positives, a well-known fully complex-valued relaxation network classifier is used in the last stage of DL-CNN network. Experimental results using the standard benchmarking breast cancer dataset (MIAS and BCDR) show that the proposed method exhibits significant improvement in performance over the traditional methods. Performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC achieved are 99%, 0.9875, 1.0 and 0.9815, respectively.

The constant monitoring of critical scenarios has make WSNs an attractive choice for researchers at a large scale. The main objective is to increase the network lifetime for optimal and efficient utilization of resources in WSNs. For optimum functionality, various approaches have been proposed based upon clustering. Network lifetime is related with energy level of sensor nodes deployed in region of interest. As sensor nodes have limited lifetime, so there is a need to develop an algorithm for aggregating the sensors data in WSNs. A novel Dynamic Adaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation (DAHDA) algorithm has been presented for evolving, uniform and non-uniform networks while maintaining the data accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to handle sudden bursts in the underlying data by recording the data in the area of interest for the whole event duration. The experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data shows that the algorithm performs well in terms of extending the lifetime of the network, maintaining the original distribution of the sensors as long as possible and maintaining the accuracy of the sensed data. DAHDA is an adaptive hierarchical aggregation algorithm for WSNs. The proposed algorithm has been simulated and its performance has been compared with the existing approaches in terms of residual energy, number of alive nodes, data accuracy, sudden burst detection, sensor distribution, lifetime of last node, first node and average lifetime of node for uniform, non-uniform and evolving networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Data aggregation; Density based clustering; Hierarchical routing; Network lifetime; Non-uniform networks; Wireless Sensor Networks","Image segmentation; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Data aggregation; Density-based Clustering; Hierarchical routings; Network lifetime; Non-uniform; Wireless sensor networks","Randhawa, S.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: sukhchandan@thapar.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027501575

Among different variants of rough clustering, rough-probabilistic clustering is a new concept introduced recently. In rough-probabilistic clustering, a class is defined as the union of two disjoint regions, namely, a crisp lower approximation region and a probabilistic boundary region. In this regard, stomped normal (SN) distribution provides a statistical modeling of the data set in rough-probabilistic clustering framework. The SN distribution models the central tendency, dispersion, and width of the lower approximation region of each class using its mean, variance, and width parameter, respectively. However, it does not take into consideration the property of kurtosis of the class distribution, which controls the concentration of values around mean and shape of the tail of data distribution. In this background, a novel probability distribution, named stomped-t (St) distribution, is introduced in the paper for rough-probabilistic clustering. The proposed probability distribution incorporates the property of kurtosis into the SN framework. The proposed St probability distribution is then integrated within the rough-probabilistic clustering framework for precise and robust clustering of the data. The efficacy of the proposed clustering algorithm is demonstrated for unsupervised data clustering and image segmentation problems, along with a comparative performance analysis with related algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Expectation-maximization algorithm; Hidden Markov random field model; Image segmentation; Rough-probabilistic clustering; Stomped normal distribution","Cluster analysis; Data mining; Higher order statistics; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Markov processes; Maximum principle; Normal distribution; Pattern recognition; Probability; Probability distributions; Class distributions; Comparative performance analysis; Distribution models; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Hidden Markov random field model; Lower approximation; Probabilistic clustering; Statistical modeling; Clustering algorithms","Maji, P.; Biomedical Imaging and Bioinformatics Lab, Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: pmaji@isical.ac.in",,"Elsevier Inc.",00200255,,ISIJB,,"English","Inf Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028731427

In this paper, we propose an efficient CAD system to classify pathological and healthy brains using brain MR images. The suggested pathological brain detection system (PBDS) has the ability to help radiologists to initiate the corrective measures for treating the ailing patients at an early stage. The proposed scheme uses a simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN) for the region of interest (ROI) segmentation and fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT) for feature extraction. Subsequently, PCA+LDA approach is harnessed for feature dimensionality reduction and finally probabilistic neural network (PNN) is applied for classification. The scheme is validated on various standard datasets and compared with existing competent schemes with respect to classification accuracy and number of features. The statistical set up is kept similar as reported in the recent literature to derive an unbiased analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested scheme yields higher accuracy as compared to others with considerably less number of features. The number of parameters need to be tuned at different stages are significantly less in contrast to existing schemes. Further, PNN used has a simple network structure and offers faster learning speed. Therefore, the proposed scheme can effectively detect pathological brain in real-time and hence has a potential to be installed on medical robots. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD); Fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); PCA+LDA; Probabilistic neural network (PNN); Pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN)","Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT); PCA+LDA; Probabilistic neural networks; Pulse coupled neural network; Computer aided diagnosis","Nayak, D.R.; Pattern Recognition Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 769 008, India; email: depakranjannayak@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021979257

The uniqueness of the proposed method is to estimate the channel response in blind fashion and minimize the BER in MIMO-OFCDM. Linear Precoding based blind channel estimation is implemented to estimate the performance of the MIMO-OFCDM for various parameters including different number of users, three different modulations such as BPSK, QPSK and 16 QAM, two types of Spreading Factors over AWGN and Rayleigh channels. The system performance is then compared with the other existing methods. It is found that the blind channel estimation provides better performance with minimum BER.

Increasing capacity with finite power requirement in wireless networks is one of the main challenges for high speed communications. A new method of power allocation in wireless communication using beamforming vector based sectored relay planning for capacity enhancement has been proposed. It has been observed that any number of terminals (receive antennas) in the downlink can be incorporated without the requirement of additional link budget. Moreover, it has also been observed in the proposed technique that required power is also independent of coverage area i.e., the channel losses at cell borders. This optimal power allocation has been observed using beamforming vector. The beamforming vector becomes independent of transmitter diversity and is the function of receive antennas on both wireless backhaul and access link (sampled impulse response). The target signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) in the proposed technique can be achieved at small and finite power; therefore any capacity can be achieved at the target SINR. This is in contradiction to the major outcomes of the Shannon’s theorem.

In this paper, we derive the expression for outage probability when the signal-of-interest (SoI) and interferers both experience κ-μ shadowed fading in an interference limited scenario. The derived expression is valid for arbitrary SoI parameters, arbitrary κ, and μ parameters for all interferers and any value of the parameter m for the interferers excepting the limiting value of m → ∞. The expression can be expressed in terms of Pochhammer integral, where the integrands of integral only contains elementary functions. The outage probability expression is then simplified for various special cases, especially when SoI experiences η-μ or κ-μ fading. Furthermore, the rate expression is derived when the SoI experiences κ-μ shadowed fading with the integer values of μ, and the interferers experience κ-μ shadowed fading with arbitrary parameters. The rate expression can be expressed in terms of sum of Lauricella's function of the fourth kind. The utility of our results is demonstrated by using the derived expression to study and compare fractional frequency reuse and soft frequency reuse in the presence of κ-μ shadowed fading.

Although it is efficient and gives excellent result in case of bi-level thresholding, but its evaluation becomes computationally costly when extended to perform multilevel thresholding owing to the exhaustive search performed for the optimum threshold values. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient multilevel thresholding technique based on cuckoo search algorithm is adopted to render multilevel minimum cross entropy more practical and reduce the complexity. Experiments have been conducted over different color images including natural and satellite images exhibiting low resolution, complex backgrounds and poor illumination. The feasibility and efficiency of proposed approach is investigated through an extensive comparison with multilevel minimum cross entropy based methods that are optimized using artificial bee colony, bacterial foraging optimization, differential evolution, and wind driven optimization. In addition, the proposed approach is compared with thresholding techniques depending on between-class variance (Otsu) method and Tsalli's entropy function.

We propose to use a feature matching cost which is defined using the learned hierarchical features of given left and right stereo images and we combine it with the pixel-based intensity matching cost in our energy function. Hierarchical features are learned using the deep deconvolutional network which is trained in an unsupervised way using a database consisting of large number of stereo images. In order to perform the regularization, we propose to use the inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random field (IGMRF) and sparsity priors in our energy function. A sparse autoencoder-based approach is proposed for learning and inferring the sparse representation of disparities. The IGMRF prior captures the smoothness as well as preserves sharp discontinuities while the sparsity prior captures the sparseness in the disparity map. Finally, an iterative two-phase algorithm is proposed to estimate the dense disparity map where in phase one, sparse representation of disparities are inferred from the trained sparse autoencoder, and IGMRF parameters are computed, keeping the disparity map fixed and in phase two, the disparity map is refined by minimizing the energy function using graph cuts, with other parameters fixed. Experimental results on the Middlebury stereo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017 The Author(s).","Disparity; IGMRF; Sparsity; Stereo; Unsupervised feature learning","Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Markov processes; Disparity; IGMRF; Sparsity; Stereo; Unsupervised feature learning; Stereo image processing","Nahar, S.; LNM Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: sonam@lnmiit.ac.in",,"Information Processing Society of Japan",18826695,,,,"English","IPSJ Trans.

The tumor region having severe intensity variations and suffering from poor boundaries are to be detected by the proposed hybrid technique that could ease the process of clinical diagnosis and this tends to be the core subject of this article. The ability of the proposed technique is compared using standard comparison parameters such as mean squared error, peak signal to noise ratio, computational time, Dice Overlap Index, and Jaccard Tanimoto Coefficient Index. The proposed CBS combined with interval type-2 fuzzy based clustering produces a sensitivity of 0.7143 and specificity of 0.9375, which are far better than the conventional techniques such as kernel based, entropy based, graph-cut based, and self-organizing maps based clustering. Appreciable segmentation results of tumor region that enhances clinical diagnosis is made available through this article and two of the radiologists who have hands on experience in the field of radiology have extended their support in validating the efficiency of the proposed methodology and have given their consent in utilizing the proposed methodology in the processes of clinical oncology. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cuckoo-Based Search; interval type-2 fuzzy clustering; MR brain image segmentation; tumor identification","Brain mapping; Conformal mapping; Diagnosis; Electric circuit breakers; Fuzzy clustering; Graphic methods; Magnetic resonance; Mean square error; Self organizing maps; Signal to noise ratio; Tumors; User interfaces; Comparison parameters; Conventional techniques; Cuckoo-Based Search; Fuzzy clustering techniques; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Magnetic resonance brain images; MR brain image segmentation; Peak signal to noise ratio; Image segmentation","Alagarsamy, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kalasalingam UniversityIndia; email: a.saravanan@klu.ac.in",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",08999457,,IJITE,,"English","Int J Imaging Syst Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034574944

On-line surface inspection systems can effectively detect and classify defects and help in taking corrective actions. For detection of defects use of gradients is very popular in highlighting and subsequently segmenting areas of interest in a surface inspection system. Most of the time, segmentation by a fixed value threshold leads to unsatisfactory results. As defects can be both very small and large in size, segmentation of a gradient image based on percentile thresholding can lead to inadequate or excessive segmentation of defective regions. A global adaptive percentile thresholding of gradient image has been formulated for blister defect and water-deposit (a pseudo defect) in steel strips. The developed method adaptively changes the percentile value used for thresholding depending on the number of pixels above some specific values of gray level of the gradient image. The method is able to segment defective regions selectively preserving the characteristics of defects irrespective of the size of the defects. The developed method performs better than Otsu method of thresholding and an adaptive thresholding method based on local properties. © 2017, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Adaptive/variable thresholding; Machine vision; Steel surface; Surface defect detection","Computer vision; Defects; Image segmentation; Inspection equipment; Strip metal; Adaptive thresholding; Characteristics of defect; Corrective actions; Defect detection; Detection of defects; Surface defect detections; Surface inspection system; Thresholding; Surface defects","Neogi, N.; Ramchandra Chandravansi Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: nirbharneogi@gmail.com",,"Springer India",22502106,,,,"English","J.

While this kind of deployment is expected to prepare LTE-A networks to serve the subscribers better, it will further increase their energy consumption thereby raising the carbon footprint on the environment. Hence, there is a rising need to design energy saving mechanisms for dense LTE-A HetNets. In this work, we propose a novel two stage technique to opportunistically minimize the count of base stations in a dense LTE-A HetNet, required to serve the users traffic, whose schedule is obtained from any scheduling policy that the network employs, in every scheduling interval. We employ a greedy algorithm to minimize the count of the base stations in each scheduling interval.

In order to preserve these precious music sheets, they needs to be digitization followed by conversion into machine readable format, such that a system can decode the symbolic images automatically and play the music. If an image of the musical work becomes available, the entire process of digitization can be considered as a document image processing application. Musical notes to it machine readable format conversion mainly aims at reading automatically generated musical scores in order to convert them to an electronic format such as MIDI file. In this paper, we propose a system that takes an image of a music sheet as input, identifies music symbols, calculates their pitch and duration and outputs a string corresponding to each line in the music sheet which can be played using Musicgui in DSP Toolbox. Major challenge faced is the removal of staff lines in the music sheet image without losing music symbols. Major steps involved in this are staff line removal, symbol extraction, symbol recognition, and conversion of musical scores into MIDI format. © 2017 IEEE.","MIDI; Musical notes; Projection profile analysis; Segmentation; Staff lines","Image processing; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Automatically generated; Document image processing; Machine-readable format; MIDI; Musical notes; Projection profile analysis; Staff lines; Symbol recognition; Electronic document exchange",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

A commonly known method to attain secrecy of information is done by addition of noise to corrupt the intruder's channel. In this paper, we undertake the principle of multiple inter-symbol obfuscation (MIO) method to improve security in wireless based communication in the last level of the OSI (Open System Interconnect) model, i.e. the physical layer. On encryption using the concept of MIO, an arbitrary subgroup of the respective symbols are put into data packets that are obscured with a group of artificially included noise symbols, commonly known as the symbols key. This tends to corrupt the third party's quality of the channel and make it worse than the genuine receiver. Hence he cannot unravel the information correctly without knowledge of the symbols key used in encryption. A self-updating process for the key is designed for automatic update of the key to enhance the encryption process. With the help of a dynamic key update process the legitimate receiver is able to encrypt the given information from the transmitter and protect it from the intruders who try to extract the message. Hence this method can deliver secrecy against passive eavesdropping and computational discretion against the fake packet injection attacks. This paper has been implemented using tools such as MATLAB and simulations have been carried out to determine the efficacy of MIO in wireless communication. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial noise; Information-Theoretic secrecy; Physical layer security; Symbols key; Wireless communications security","Information theory; MATLAB; Network layers; Network security; Open systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Artificial noise; Automatic updates; Communications security; Information-theoretic secrecies; Open system interconnects; Packet injection; Physical layer security; Wireless communications; Cryptography","Ramanathan, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita University, Amrita Vishwa VidyapeethamIndia; email: r_ramanathan@cb.amrita.edu",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

The advancement of many wireless technologies today like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RF, Zigbee, WiMAX, Zwave, etc paved way for the developers to explore a variety of alternatives to design a smart home system. Although there are various wireless technologies to choose from, the performance of the system is determined by the interplay of networked sensors and actuators. This paper proposes a voice-controlled smart home (eHome) with multi-functions using Radio Frequency as the wireless choice. The proposed system is secured with a user's voice-password. The speaker dependent feature of this system makes it tightly secured. The voice-commands are recognised by a dedicated hardware module and the recognised data is sent wirelessly through a radio-frequency (RF) transmitter attached to a Arduino microcontroller board. RF receiver on the receiver unit reads the data from the transmitter and a Raspberry Pi attached to the receiver decodes the commands spoken by the user and controls the home appliances.

In a recent survey, Gartner reported that nearly 20% organizations have rogue access points inside their premises. WLANs have evolved with the rapid development of wireless technologies. Nowadays WLAN is present in almost everywhere from a school to a Multinational Company, a coffee shop to public transport. Their presence has become indispensable in any organization, as they are cost effective and easily deployable. Predicting rogue access points with proper accuracy and using low cost is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an external rogue access point prediction mechanism which uses radio frequency(RF) signal strength to predict a rogue access point. The prediction of rogue access points happens in two phases: Distance Calculation and Access Point Prediction. The first phase uses FSPL transmission model to calculate the distances of various APs from the user device by collecting strength of radio frequency signal from each AP. The second phase predicts whether an external AP is rogue or not based on the calculated distance and by comparing it with a threshold distance. We have tested our mechanism by implementing it in an Android based smartphone and it was successfully able to predict rogue APs with acceptable accuracies. The threshold values were decided based on extensive experiments conducted in IIT Guwahati campus. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Radio transmission; Radio waves; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Distance calculation; Multi-national companies; Prediction mechanisms; Radiofrequency signals; RF signal strength; Threshold distances; Transmission model; Wireless technologies; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

The size of lung nodule which reflects the malignant nature helps in early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. False detection of lung nodule will misinterpret healthy patient as lung cancer patient which may lead to wrong medication by the clinician. Existing algorithms for detection of lung nodule like Active Contour Model, Markov Gibbs Random Field model, Expectation Maximization algorithm, Active Appearance Model etc which solves the problem for certain extent, but have drawbacks such as large parameterization, re-initialization, blurring of image, failure to enter concavities, intensity in homogeneity and inability to differentiate different types of nodules. To overcome these drawbacks, a realistic approach is proposed by using partial differential equation based technique. The proposed method adopts Perona-Malik model for enhancement procedure and geometric active contour model for segmentation. Proposed method can efficiently deblur the contours of the original image containing weak or blurred edges. Pre-processed CT images are successfully segmented using geometric active contour model.

A new unsupervised multi-person re-identification algorithm has been developed, which dynamically assigns labels to persons for recognition. Detection of persons that have ever been in motion but become stationary for a long time is a challenge in conventional motion-based foreground detection methods. The proposed algorithm overcomes this challenge using information from the bounding boxes, targeting persons from precedent frame where they last moved. Chan-Vese active contours method is used to get proper shape of persons and corresponding bounding boxes from the foreground extracted by using the traditional GMM method. The proper shape obtained from active contours method is used to minimize the area of background in the tracked bounding box, which increases the accuracy of person reidentification. Parallel fusion of color moments and structure tensors are proposed to solve the problem of person re-identification. For re-identification, distinctive color features of the persons are extracted and stored on their first appearance in the field of view. In the subsequent appearances, their corresponding features are compared with the stored features using sum of absolute difference and are properly labelled based on the similarity measure. Experiments were conducted on IIT Patna database and our experimental study shows robustness in multi person tracking and re-identification. The result shows that this approach leads to improvement in multi-person tracking with 26.79% increase in accuracy compared to GMM and 85.33% correct re-identification of person. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Gaussian distribution; Chan-Vese active contours; Foreground detection; Gaussian Mixture Model; Multi-person tracking; Person re identifications; Re identifications; Similarity measure; Sum of absolute differences; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

This paper describes a model for face tracking in video sequences using Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) software library. To increase the face tracking accuracy, we propose a real time face tracking algorithm based on integration of Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMShift) and kalman filter. First, haar cascade detects face in the video sequence; once the face is detected then other parts like eyes, nose and mouth are detected. After successful face region detection, key-points are extracted using Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) framework and CAMShift algorithm applied. CAMShift algorithm calculates width, height and (x,y) coordinates of the face region and this information is provided to kalman filter. Kalman filter calculates new center and size of the bounding box. Based on the center information, face tracking takes place in further frames. The experimental results at the end of this paper clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm integrating CAMShift and kalman filter is better to each single approach. Using this algorithm, we can achieve faster speed in face tracking. © 2017 IEEE.","CAMShift; Center; Face detection; Face tracking; Haar cascade; Kalman filter; OpenCV; SURF; Video sequences","Computer vision; Image segmentation; Kalman filters; Open source software; Open systems; Signal detection; Tracking (position); Video recording; CamShift; Center; Face Tracking; OpenCV; SURF; Video sequences; Face recognition",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

An optimal thresholding technique can be taken as a single objective optimization task, where computation and obtaining a solution can become inefficient, especially at higher threshold levels. In this paper, a new and efficient color image multilevel thresholding approach is presented to perform image segmentation by exploiting the correlation among gray levels. The proposed method incorporates gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and cuckoo search (CS) in order to effectively enhance the optimal multilevel thresholding of colored natural and satellite images exhibiting complex background and non-uniformities in illumination and features. The experimental results are presented in terms of mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity index (FSIM), structural similarity index (SSIM), computational time (CPU time in seconds), and optimal threshold values for each primary color component at different thresholding levels for each of the test images. In addition, experiments are also conducted on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS300), and four performance indices of image segmentation- Probability Rand Index (PRI), Variation of Information (VoI), Global Consistency Error (GCE), and Boundary Displacement Error (BDE) are tested. To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, other optimization algorithm such as artificial bee colony (ABC), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), and firefly algorithm (FA) are compared using GLCM as an objective function.

Any attempt of developing the system dealing with the fish disease diagnosis and to overcome various difficulties is in it has still not met any extra ordinary success. Identification of diseased fish at early stage is necessary step to prevent from spreading disease. This paper recognizes and identifies the EUS (Epizootic Ulcerative syndrome) disease which is caused by bn Aphanomyces invadans, a fungal pathogen. It is a red spot disease and looks like ulcer hence it is generally misidentified by the people. The paper is divided into two parts, in the first part segmentation has been applied to enhance the image, various edge detection techniques have applied to get the useful information and Morphological operations have been applied on the EUS diseased fish image. In second part features are extracted from the EUS infected fish image through different feature Descriptors i.e. HOG (Histogram of Gradient),FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and classify the EUS infected and Non-EUS infected fish image through Machine Learning Algorithms and find the classification accuracy through Classifier. If PCA applied after feature extraction then it increases the accuracy as it is a dimensional reduction. The proposed combination of techniques gives better accuracy as compared to the others. The Experimentation has been done on MATLAB environment on real images of EUS infected fish database. © 2017 IEEE.","FAST (features from accelerated segment test); HOG (histogram of gradient); PCA (principle component analysis); The EUS (epizootic ulcerative syndrome)","Diagnosis; Edge detection; Fish; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mathematical morphology; Principal component analysis; Classification accuracy; FAST (features from accelerated segment test); Fish disease diagnosis; Histogram of gradients; Image processing technique; Morphological operations; Principle component analysis; The EUS (epizootic ulcerative syndrome); Image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538609682,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Periodical check ups alone can detect this kind of cancer in an early stage. The earlier the detection of disease, the easier it is to prolong the lifespan of the patient. Taking these statements into account and to serve the society, this article proposes a segmentation algorithm for cervical cell images. The objective of this work is attained in two steps such as cervical image pre-processing and segmentation. The cervical image pre-processing intends to remove the noise by employing adaptive median filter. The irregular staining effect of the cervical images is addressed by Haar wavelets. The background subtraction is achieved by bit slice plane technique. The pre-processed images are segmented by means of Intersecting Cortical Model (ICM) and cuckoo search algorithm. The parameters of ICM are fixed by the cuckoo search algorithm, in order to make the algorithm completely automated. The results of this algorithm are satisfactory in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision rates. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the related state-of-the-art works. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature","Cervical cancer; Optimization; Pre-processing; Segmentation","Adaptive filters; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Median filters; Optimization; Adaptive median filter; Automated segmentation; Background subtraction; Cervical cancers; Cuckoo search algorithms; Intersecting cortical models; Pre-processing; Segmentation algorithms; Image segmentation","Lakshmi, G.A.; Manonmaniam Sundaranar UniversityIndia; email: annalakshmi.msu@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",18685137,,,,"English","J.

This paper presents the document image binarization method by adaptive image contrast which is the integration of the local image gradient and the local image contrast which is lenient to background and text variation generated by various document degradations. Initially, an adaptive contrast map is constructed for the input degraded document image by the proposed document image binarization method. Then, the binarization is performed on this adaptive contrast map and the binarized contrast map is integrated with the Canny's edge map for determining the text stroke edge pixels. After that, depends on the local threshold which is defined by the identified text stroke edge pixels' intensities in the local window, the document text is divided. The proposed method is straight forward, vigorous, and it requires least amount of parameter tuning.

The OD segmentation is also used for the detection of other anatomical structures like fovea and vascular tree. Many algorithms based on thresholding, active contour model, GVF snake and clustering have been proposed for the segmentation of OD. In this study, a novel method is proposed for optic disc segmentation. The method makes use of P-Tile thresholding for detecting patch of OD. Connected component analysis is performed for eliminating false positives. This step yields initial patch of optic disc for which centroid correction is performed. GVF snake model is used for finding the contour of OD. The method is robust and effective even in the low contrast images as well as in the presence of other pathological structures like exudates.

Unlike the traditional ACM variant, which is frequently caught in a local minimum, this methodology helps the focalizing of control points toward the global least of the energy function. In the proposed system, energy minimization is performed through a fruit fly algorithm, and every control point is compelled in a local search window. As for the local search window, the rectangular-shaped approach has been viewed. The results demonstrated that the fruit fly strategy utilizing polar coordinates is, for the most part, desirable over the fruit fly performed in rectangular shapes. Three performance metrics, such as the Jaccard index, the Dice index, and the Hausdorff distance, were utilized to validate the proposed strategy in real agricultural and synthetic images.

People with diabetes are more likely to get affected by diabetic retinopathy. There are many screening techniques available to diagnose this pathology. Majority of this screening methods use the retinal image of the patient for the diagnosis. Recently many automatic retinal image analysis methods are being developed to automate the diagnosis of this pathology, thereby eliminating the need for a specialist ophthalmologist for such a screening. In order to evaluate the performance of any such automatic method, there is a need for a database of retinal images which could act as a reference for bench-marking the performance of the methods developed. In this paper, we discuss a new retinal image database known as University of Auckland Diabetic Retinopathy database (UoA-DR), prepared specifically for benchmarking the performance of various automatic systems developed for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. This database consists of 200 retinal images mostly affected with diabetic retinopathy.

The high dimensional data sets generally comprise of irrelevant and redundant features also along with the relevant features which deteriorate the clustering result. Therefore, feature selection is necessary to select a subset of relevant features as it improves discrimination ability of the original set of features which helps in improving the clustering result. Though many metaheuristics have been suggested to select subset of the relevant features in wrapper framework based on some criteria, most of them are marred by the three key issues. First, they require objects class information a priori which is unknown in unsupervised feature selection. Second, feature subset selection is devised on a single validity measure; hence, it produces a single best solution biased toward the cardinality of the feature subset. Third, they find difficulty in avoiding local optima owing to lack of balancing in exploration and exploitation in the feature search space. To deal with the first issue, we use unsupervised feature selection method where no class information is required. To address the second issue, we follow pareto-based approach to obtain diverse trade-off solutions by optimizing conceptually contradicting validity measures silhouette index (Sil) and feature cardinality (d). For the third issue, we introduce genetic crossover operator to improve diversity in a recent Newtonian law of gravity-based metaheuristic binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in multi-objective optimization scenario; it is named as improved multi-objective BGSA for feature selection (IMBGSAFS). We use ten real-world data sets for comparison of the IMBGSAFS results with three multi-objective methods MBGSA, MOPSO, and NSGA-II in wrapper framework and the Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (FM-CC) as a multi-objective filter method. We employ four multi-objective quality measures convergence, diversity, coverage and ONVG. The obtained results show superiority of the IMBGSAFS over its competitors. An external clustering validity index F-measure also establish the above finding. As the decision maker picks only a single solution from the set of trade-off solutions, we employee the F-measure to select a final single solution from the external archive. The quality of final solution achieved by IMBGSAFS is superior over competitors in terms of clustering accuracy and/or smaller subset size. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature","Data clustering; Feature selection; Gravitational search algorithm; Multi-objective optimization","Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Set theory; Clustering validity index; Data clustering; Exploration and exploitation; Feature subset selection; Gravitational search algorithms; Linear correlation coefficient; Unsupervised classification; Unsupervised feature selection; Feature extraction","Prakash, J.; Computational Intelligence and Data Mining Research Laboratory, ABV - Indian Institute of Information technology and Management GwaliorIndia; email: jayprakash.iiitm@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035104565

It determines the cost to construct, capacity, coverage ratio and quality of service (QoS). In 2G and 3G standards, eNBs have similar coverage range. The idea of heterogeneous network (HetNet) is launched in long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), where the network contains different eNBs of different coverage ranges. The HetNet contains both large power macro-cells and less power small-cells such as pico, femto and relay nodes. But the placement of different eNBs is very difficult. We have proposed a four phase scheme for the placement of different eNBs based on uniform clustering concepts. Our placement scheme chooses optimal eNB sites from the candidate sites in the service area. Also according to the constraint of power on each eNB, it will alter the range of cell to offer the proper coverage while satisfying the demands of user. From the simulation outcomes, it is proved that our suggested scheme reduces the system cost and also provides better coverage ratio under the power constraints. © 2017 IEEE.","Evolved node base Station (eNB); Heterogeneous network (HetNet); Long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A); Multi-hop relay networks (MHR); Quality of service (QoS)","Base stations; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cost effective; Coverage ranges; Coverage ratio; Evolved node base Station (eNB); Heterogeneous Network (HetNet); Multi-hop relay networks; Placement scheme; Power constraints; Long Term Evolution (LTE)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045273,,,"English","Proc.

In DSM, two-way secured communications between customers and service provider are established. The entire distribution system is divided into segments, where each segment is having a local energy management system and all local energy management systems are linked to the central energy management system via a communication channel. However, this paper deals with a scaled down version of total number of customers and there is no local energy management unit. Here, the customer directly interacts with the Central Energy Management Unit (CEMU) before the Service Provider dispatches power to the customer's end. The communication channel is established via Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and both the data packets (from customer to the CEMU) as well as command signals (from CEMU to load end) is sent wirelessly via GSM network. The CEMU decides the scheduling of all the loads by using Load Shifting Technique.

It is the process through which best available path between the source and the destination nodes is identified. This selection procedure is carried out with the help of measurements that address various issues of the network. Such measurements are called as routing metrics. Routing metrics are in the course of evolution addressing the issues such as path length, transmission failures, interference, congestion etc. Considering the fact that maintenance of connectivity in multi-hop wireless networks is important and congestion in the network should not be a hindrance, we propose a congestion aware medium access based routing metric, Request To Send (RTS)-Clear To Send (CTS) Retransmission count (RCR) for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN). The metric considers RTS-CTS handshake of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) method. It is incorporated in Multi-radio Multi-channel (MRMC) WMN for its wide usage. The channel assignment (CA) scheme utilized is cluster based with Latin matrix allocation strategy for MRMC WMN. The metric and the CA scheme are simulated in the network simulator NS3. The results depict a comparably better performance by RCR and Cluster based Channel and Backoff Assignment Scheme (CCBAS) than the Airtime link cost metric and conventional CA strategy respectively of WMN. © 2017 IEEE.","Back off slot assignment; Channel Assignment; Routing Metric","Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidances; Channel Assignment; Channel assignment scheme; Multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC); Multihop wireless network; Routing metrics; Slot assignment; Wireless communications; MESH networking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

Difference of this energy corresponding to both the regions is used as the external energy of the proposed ACM. The contour stops and converges completely when this difference attains a maximum value. The proposed approach requires only initial contour selection and no object point selection like the other variants of parametric ACM used for texture segmentation.

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

Brain tissue is explicitly complex and it consists of three normal main tissues named White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM) and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and abnormal tissues like tumor and edema. These normal and abnormal tissues can be detected using segmentation of the brain MR image and are very important for surgical planning and in diagnosing neurological diseases. This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of normal and abnormal tissues. Anisotropic diffusion filtering is used as the preprocessing step. The part of the algorithm used to detect the healthy tissues WM, GM, and CSF is based on multilevel thresholding that selects the best threshold values using Electro-magnetism-Like algorithm. A Region-based Active Contour is used to detect the tumor. A trained Support Vector Machine with different kernels which can be treated as KSVM is used for the classification of the tumor. In the classification process, features are extracted from the tumor images using the single level decomposition of 2-D Daubechies DWT. The high dimensioned feature vector is reduced by using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The suggested method can identify the benign and malignant type of tumors. The pursuance of the suggested method is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, segmentation accuracy using ground truth images and results are compared with some of the existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Active Contours; CSF; DWT; Electro-magnetism-Like algorithm; GM; ICA; KSVM; MRI; WM","Brain; Cerebrospinal fluid; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Histology; Image classification; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Independent component analysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal reconstruction; Support vector machines; Tissue; Tumors; Active contours; Anisotropic diffusion filtering; Cerebral spinal fluids; Classification process; Independent component analysis(ICA); KSVM; Multilevel thresholding; Region based active contours; Tissue engineering",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467388542,,,"English","Int.

Numerous speckle noise removal techniques have been proposed in the literature based on anisotropic filtering, wavelets and morphology; however they have some major problems like loss of edge information, texture information and inability to remove low frequency noise. Despeckling of US images is usually carried out using conventional anisotropic diffusion or speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion. However, despeckling US images may not be able to preserve the edges which comprises of important clinical information. To overcome the issues in speckle noise removal (despeckling) of US images, contourlet transform based anisotropic nonlinear diffusion filtering is proposed in this paper. Contourlet transform improves some important features like multiscale and directionality. Adaptive nonlinear diffusion has been incorporated in anisotropic filtering to improve the filtering performance. The comparison performance of the proposed method with other despeckling techniques indicates that it has better noise removal performance for medical US images. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Anisotropic diffusion; Contourlet transform; Despeckling; Multiresolution analysis; Ultrasound image","Adaptive filtering; Anisotropy; Diagnosis; Diffusion; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Information filtering; Mathematical transformations; Medical imaging; Multiresolution analysis; Optical anisotropy; Speckle; Ultrasonics; Anisotropic Diffusion; Contourlet transform; De-speckling; Filtering performance; Nonlinear diffusion filtering; Speckle noise removal; Speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion; Ultrasound images; Image denoising","Jubairahmed, L.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Eshwar College of EngineeringIndia; email: jubairahmeed@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034613857

However, the computational complexity of multilevel thresholding increases exponentially with the increasing number of thresholds. To overcome this drawback, a new approach of multilevel thresholding based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is proposed in this paper. GWO is inspired from the social and hunting behaviour of the grey wolves. This metaheuristic algorithm is applied to multilevel thresholding problem using Kapur's entropy and Otsu's between class variance functions. The proposed method is tested on a set of standard test images. The performances of the proposed method are then compared with improved versions of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and BFO (Bacterial Foraging Optimization) based multilevel thresholding methods. The quality of the segmented images is computed using Mean Structural SIMilarity (MSSIM) index. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is more stable and yields solutions of higher quality than PSO and BFO based methods. Moreover, the proposed method is found to be faster than BFO but slower than the PSO based method. © 2017","Grey wolf optimizer; Image segmentation; Kapur's entropy; Multilevel thresholding; Otsu's threshold","Entropy; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Bacterial foraging optimization; Mean structural similarity; Meta heuristic algorithm; Multilevel thresholding; Multilevel thresholding method; Optimizers; Otsu's threshold; PSO(particle swarm optimization); Image segmentation","Chaudhury, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology (NIT) SilcharIndia; email: saurabh@nits.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725802

It also created new challenges to handle resource allocation and power optimization of User Equipment (UE). The paper explores radio resource allocation and power consumption problem of UE in LTE environment. An intelligent scheduling scheme developed is based on Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) method and AHP-TOPSIS method. It distributes resources in a fair way among a number of applications and UE are prioritized based on certain criteria like delay, throughput history, UE buffer space and channel conditions and preferences. In LTE, Discontinuous Reception (DRX) has been adopted to conserve the battery life of UE. DRX periodically switches off the radio interfaces to conserve the battery life but it may breach Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, the DRX parameters need to be further optimized to satisfy QoS and minimize power consumption of UE. DRX parameters are dynamically adjusted on the basis of current load and channel condition of the network. Power saving operations are numerically analyzed. Simulation results show that the expert and an intelligent system can distribute resources in a fair way among UE, improves the battery consumption of UE up to 85% and packets transmission delay by 10% as compared to existing scheme for real-time applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AHP-TOPSIS method; Cooperative Game Theory; DRX; LTE; Scheduling","4G mobile communication systems; Analytic hierarchy process; Bandwidth; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Hierarchical systems; Intelligent systems; Internet telephony; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Next generation networks; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Standards; Video streaming; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Battery consumption; Cooperative game theory; Discontinuous receptions; Intelligent scheduling; Multimedia applications; Radio resource allocation; Real-time application; TOPSIS method; Game theory","Goyal, T.; Computer Science and Enigneering, UIET, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: tanugoyal27@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020005624

In particular, to be able to use polar codes in a wireless scenario, varying attenuation due to fading needs to be mitigated. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive work in this direction thus far. In this work, a practical scheme involving channel inversion with the knowledge of the channel state at the transmitter, is proposed. An additional practical constraint on the permissible average and peak power is imposed, which in turn makes the channel equivalent to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel cascaded with an erasure channel. It is shown that the constructed polar code could be made to achieve the symmetric capacity of this channel. Further, a means to compute the optimal design rate of the polar code for a given power constraint is also discussed. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Fading channels; Gaussian noise (electronic); Optimal systems; White noise; Wireless telecommunication systems; Additive white Gaussian noise channel; Channel inversion; Delay constraints; Erasure channels; Power constraints; Practical schemes; Symmetric capacity; Wireless scenarios; Codes (symbols)",,,"VDE Verlag GmbH",21540217,9781538629130,,,"English","Proc.

The classical receivers like maximal ratio combining, minimum mean square error, and iterative block–decision feedback equalization fail to cancel MAI when the MC–CDMA is subjected to severe nonlinear distortions, which may occur due to saturated power amplifiers or arbitrary channel conditions. Being highly nonlinear structures, the neural network receivers such as multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network could be better alternative for such a case.

LTE Wi-Fi radio level integration with IPSec tunnel (LWIP) corresponds to realizing this binding at IP layer. A collocated deployment of LWIP enables greater flexibility in utilizing the channel efficiently. With the advent of bandwidth-hungry smartphone Apps and IoT applications, the cellular uplink resources become highly demanding. This enforces Wi-Fi to support efficient uplink transmissions since the uplink transmissions through Wi-Fi suffers high contention because of distributed nature of Wi-Fi MAC. In order to improve Wi-Fi channel utilization by leveraging the potential of LWIP in controlling and coordinating the transmissions through LTE and Wi-Fi links, we introduce Network Coordination Function (NCF) in LWIP. The proposed NCF focuses on coordinating the uplink transmissions through Wi-Fi in a network with high load. NCF enhances the channel utilization of Wi-Fi network by regulating the packet arrival rate to the Wi-Fi link and also by revamping medium access techniques at the Wi-Fi interface of users associated with LWIP node. NCF is composed of four different uplink traffic steering algorithms with diverse objectives which improve Wi-Fi channel utilization by (i) minimizing collisions among LWIP users, (ii) increasing transmission opportunities for Wi-Fi users that are connected to legacy Wi-Fi APs operating on the same channel, and (iii) ensuring fairness for both LWIP and Wi-Fi users. Interestingly, NCF has not only improved the throughput of LWIP users but also the throughput of Wi-Fi users. Simulation experiments reveal that NCF has reduced collisions in the Wi-Fi uplink by 13–53% and improved throughput by 10–37% as compared to Wi-Fi offloading and Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Interworking; Link aggregation; LTE-Wi-Fi aggregation; LWIP; Traffic steering","Bins; Mobile telecommunication systems; Throughput; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Distributed coordination functions; Interworking; Link aggregation; LWIP; Network coordinations; Steering algorithms; Transmission opportunities; Up-link transmissions; Wi-Fi","Santhappan, T.V.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology HyderabadIndia; email: cs13p1002@iith.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

It is mainly adopted in the uplink of LTE and LTE-A cellular systems. OFDMA is another key technique employed in downlink of current wireless systems. These techniques offers benefits like increase in throughput, bandwidth efficiency, data rate and less interference. Apart from these advantages it suffers from the problem of high PAPR over a journey 4G to 5G. Although, there is extensive work done in this aspect, still there is a gap to further reduce the PAPR and improve the efficiency of next generation wireless networks. In this paper, the performance evaluation of SC-FDMA and OFDMA is carried out in LTE physical layer using various probabilistic schemes (PTS and SLM), adaptive modulation shift keying (Mary-PSK and Mary-QAM) by considering the parameters like PAPR. The study of various research papers tells that the PTS has a better PAPR reduction than SLM and when companding is, performed (Formula presented.)-law yields good results compared to A-law.

Empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) has been derived. In order to segment the Fourier spectrum of the EEG signals, the scale-space representation based boundary detection method has been employed. Then, EWT is used to decompose EEG signals into narrow sub-band signals and HMS of these sub-band signals have been computed. For a synthetically generated multi-component frequency modulated signal, the EWT based HMS is compared with the conventional Fourier spectrum obtained using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Three features have been extracted from these HMSs which belong to distinct oscillatory levels of the EEG signals and probability (p) value based feature ranking is performed. Finally, the selected features are fed to random forest classifier for classifying EEG signals of seizure and seizure-free classes. We have achieved 99.3% classification accuracy with only 50% training rate which shows the usefulness of the proposed method for the classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. © 2017 IEEE.","Electroencephalogram (EEG); empirical wavelet transform; features; Hilbert marginal spectrum; random forest","Decision trees; Digital signal processing; Electroencephalography; Fast Fourier transforms; Image segmentation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Wavelet transforms; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram signals; Fast Fourier transform algorithm; features; Frequency modulated signal; Hilbert marginal spectrum; Random forests; Scale-space representation; Biomedical signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538618950,,,"English","Int Conf Dig Signal Process DSP",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040314647

This system is named LTE-CommSense by the authors and can be used in many environment sensing objectives namely monitoring of crop growth over a period of time, disaster monitoring, sea state monitoring, snow avalanche monitoring, security of large unmanned landscapes etc. This technology focuses on already known information from received signal e.g. reference symbols in the LTE communication signal frames. In the equalizer block of the receiver, the equalizer tap coefficients gets modified while training the equalizer using reference symbols. These modifications depend on the channel through which the received signal has passed through. Therefore the adaptive equalizer tap coefficients contain information related to the channel condition. We propose to use these coefficients to get an estimate of change in the channel properties. LTE spectrum and infrastructure will be utilized to get channel characteristics without affecting the existing communication system. After the channel information is received, phenomenological knowledge about the environment will be obtained using ASIN (Application Specific INstrumentation) phylosophy.

To achieve this target, this paper aims to implement a unique Radio Resource Management scheme for a heterogeneous LTE based BWA network (BWA Het-Nets) which consists of Small cells along with Macro cells. The proposed analysis has two components: (1) Received Signal Strength (RSS) based CAC policy; and (2) Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) scheme for QoS provisioning. The novelty of this work lies on the integration of the RSS based CAC policy with DBA scheme for improved performance in terms of different QoS parameters like New Call Blocking Probability (NCBP), Hand off Call Dropping Probability (HCDP) and Bandwidth Utilization (BU). A Continuous Time Markov Chain based mathematical model is also developed for the realistic analysis of those QoS parameters.

In our approach images are represented in a continuous domain based on a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with the images modeled as mixture of Gaussian distributions in the selected feature space. The distance metric between the Gaussian distributions is defined in the sense of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. The clustering is done using a semi-supervised learning framework where labeled data in the form of cluster templates is used to classify the unlabelled data. The clusters are formed around initially chosen seeds and are updated in the due course based on user inputs. In our clustering approach the user interaction is done in a structured way as to get maximum inputs from the user in a limited time. We propose two methods to carry out the structured user interaction using which the cluster templates are updated to improve the quality of the clusters formed. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on benchmark datasets that are specifically chosen to include a wide variation of images around a common theme that is typically encountered in applications like photo-summarization and poses a major semantic gap challenge to conventional clustering approaches. The experimental results presented demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Gaussian mixture modeling; Image clustering; Kullback-Leibler distance","Benchmarking; Content based retrieval; Database systems; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Probability distributions; Semantics; Supervised learning; Content based image retrieval; Conventional clustering; Gaussian Mixture Model; Image clustering; Kullback-Leibler distance; Mixture of Gaussians; Probabilistic modeling; Semi- supervised learning; Image retrieval","Nisha Chandran, S.; Department of CSE, Graphic Era University, Bell road, Clement town, India; email: nisha.unnikrishnan@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017181049

Methods: A fully automatic segmentation of sino-nasal and pharyngeal airway subregions was implemented in MATLAB programing environment. The novelty of the algorithm is automatic initialization of contours in upper airway subregions. The algorithm is based on boundary definitions of the human anatomy along with shape constraints with an automatic initialization of contours to develop a complete algorithm which has a potential to enhance utility at clinical level. Post-initialization; five segmentation techniques: Chan-Vese level set (CVL), localized Chan-Vese level set (LCVL), Bhattacharya distance level set (BDL), Grow Cut (GC), and Sparse Field method (SFM) were used to test the robustness of automatic initialization. Results: Precision and F-score were found to be greater than 80% for all the regions with all five segmentation methods. High precision and low recall were observed with BDL and GC techniques indicating an under segmentation. Low precision and high recall values were observed with CVL and SFM methods indicating an over segmentation. A Larger F-score value was observed with SFM method for all the subregions. Minimum F-score value was observed for naso-ethmoidal and sphenoidal air sinus region, whereas a maximum F-score was observed in maxillary air sinuses region. The contour initialization was more accurate for maxillary air sinuses region in comparison with sphenoidal and naso-ethmoid regions. Conclusion: The overall F-score was found to be greater than 80% for all the airway subregions using five segmentation techniques, indicating accurate contour initialization. Robustness of the algorithm needs to be further tested on severely deformed cases and on cases with different races and ethnicity for it to have global acceptance in Katradental radKatraiology workflow. © 2017, CARS.","Fully automatic; Landmarks; Obstructive sleep apnea; Upper airway subregions; Volumetric analysis","adolescent; adult; anatomic landmark; anatomical concepts; Article; automation; classification algorithm; clinical article; comparative study; cone beam computed tomography; ethmoid sinus; human; image segmentation; maxillary sinus; paranasal sinus; pharynx; pilot study; priority journal; scoring system; sphenoid; three dimensional imaging; upper respiratory tract; algorithm; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; female; image processing; male; paranasal sinus; pharynx; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Paranasal Sinuses; Pharynx; Pilot Projects; Young Adult","Sardana, H.K.; Computational Instrumentation, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments OrganisationIndia; email: hk_sardana@csio.res.in",,"Springer Verlag",18616410,,,"28755036","English","Int.

In this work, we present “Adaptive Video Streaming Architecture”, an efficient resource allocation framework that attempts to maximize Quality of Experience (QoE) for a set of users by simultaneously balancing three important QoE verticals: (i) providing stutter-free viewing experience by dynamically throttling video streaming data-rates; (ii) minimizing flickers in video outputs by controlling and stabilizing the rates of encoding quality switches over time; (iii) maximizing aggregate video quality over all users. We have posed the resource allocation problem through an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation and showed that solution strategies such as conventional dynamic programming (DP) impose substantial overheads. Next, we have proposed the Streamlined DP-based Quality-level Allocator (SDQA) which utilizes the discrete nature in the data-rate scalability of video flows to retain a far lower number of non-dominating partial DP-solutions and thereby generates far quicker solutions. Further, SDQA has been extended to provide a tunable approximation scheme called SDQA-AA that can accelerate the speed of generating solutions at multiple scales with distinct bounds on solution quality.

However, due to inherent tradeoff between Pf a and Pm d, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve high value of throughput while maintaining a sufficient level of protection to the licensed users. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a CR system which while operating under the double threshold scheme does not only promise a high value of throughput but it also ensures a target level of protection to the licensed users. We further study the problem of designing a sensing duration to maximize the achievable throughput for the secondary network under the constraint that the primary users are sufficiently protected. We formulate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem mathematically, and prove that the formulated problem indeed has one optimal sensing time which yields the highest throughput for the secondary network. To overcome uncertainties of the wireless communication channel, the proposed approach was further been implemented under the cooperation of n- out- of- k CRs. It is observed that, under the proposed approach, the CR user while ensuring a target level of protection to the licensed users achieves a significant gain in throughput than the CR systems based on the single and double thresholds both. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cognitive radio; Double threshold; Energy detection; Spectrum sensing","Copyrights; Radio systems; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Double threshold; Energy detection; Probability of false alarm; Probability of missed detections; Sensing-throughput tradeoffs; Spectrum sensing; Throughput maximization; Wireless communication channels; Cognitive radio","Verma, G.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra (NITKKR)India; email: gaurav@nitkkr.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020137866

To ensure ubiquity in connections across all machines, it is necessary to have a standard infrastructure, such as 3GPP LTE-A network infrastructure, that facilitates such type of communications. However, owing to the huge scale of ?> machines to be deployed in near future and the nature of data transactions, ensuring ubiquitous connections among all the machines will be difficult. Solutions that not only maintain connectivity but also route machine data in a cost effective manner are the need of the hour. In this context, it has been suggested that Device-To-Device (D2D) communication can play a very important role in expanding network coverage and routing the data between source-destination machine pairs. In this paper, we conduct a feasibility study to highlight the impact of multi-hop D2D communication in increasing the network coverage and average rate of a Machine Type Communication (MTC) device. We present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the coverage probability and average data rate of a three-hop M2M network deployed along with User Equipments (UEs) and conduct extensive simulations to study the system performance. Our simulation results show that the three-hop M2M network formed from out-of-range MTC devices and UEs can significantly improve the coverage and average rate of the entire network. Due to the mobility of users in the network, design of robust routing mechanisms in such a time evolving network becomes difficult. Hence, we suggest the use of space-Time graph built from the predicted user locations to design a cost efficient multi-hop D2D topology that enables routing of MTC data to its destination. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","average rate; coverage; D2D communication; LTE-A network; M2M communication; routing; stochastic geometry","Cost effectiveness; Geometry; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Stochastic systems; Telecommunication links; Topology; Wireless telecommunication systems; Average rate; coverage; D2D communications; LTE-A networks; routing; Stochastic geometry; Machine-to-machine communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361233,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing.

To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","blindness; Cloud computing; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy; wireless body area networks (WBANs)","Cloud computing; Data privacy; Digital storage; Health care; Hospitals; Internet of things; Network function virtualization; Search engines; Servers; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; blindness; Body Area Network; Delays; Internet of Things (IOT); Wireless body area network; Wireless communications; Distributed computer systems","Chatterjee, S.; IIT KharagpurIndia; email: chatterjeesubarna@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10897798,,ICLEF,,"English","IEEE Commun Lett",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028459167

However, due to limitation of image acquisition devices and other related factors, MRI images are severely affected by the noise and inhomogeneity artefacts which lead to blurry edges in the intersection of the intra-organ soft tissue regions, making the segmentation process more difficult and challenging. This paper presents a novel two-stage fuzzy multi-objective framework (2sFMoF) for segmenting 3D MRI brain image data. In the first stage, a 3D spatial fuzzy c-means (3DSpFCM) algorithm is introduced by incorporating the 3D spatial neighbourhood information of the volume data to define a new local membership function along with the global membership function for each voxel. In particular, the membership functions actually define the underlying relationship between the voxels of a close cubic neighbourhood and image data in 3D image space. The cluster prototypes thus obtained are fed into a 3D modified fuzzy c-means (3DMFCM) algorithm, which further incorporates local voxel information to generate the final prototypes. The proposed framework addresses the shortcomings of the traditional FCM algorithm, which is highly sensitive to noise and may stuck into a local minima. The method is validated on a synthetic image volume and several simulated and in-vivo 3D MRI brain image volumes and found to be effective even in noisy data.

The foremost stage for computer-aided diagnosis of liver is the identification of liver region. Liver segmentation algorithms extract liver image from scan images which helps in virtual surgery simulation, speedup the diagnosis, accurate investigation and surgery planning. The existing liver segmentation algorithms try to extort exact liver image from abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. It is an open problem because of ambiguous boundaries, large variation in intensity distribution, variability of liver geometry from patient to patient and presence of noise. A novel approach is proposed to meet challenges in extracting the exact liver image from abdominal CT scan images. The proposed approach consists of three phases: (1) Pre-processing (2) CT scan image transformation to Neutrosophic Set (NS) and (3) Post-processing. In pre-processing, the noise is removed by median filter. The “new structure” is designed to transform a CT scan image into neutrosophic domain which is expressed using three membership subset: True subset (T), False subset (F) and Indeterminacy subset (I). This transform approximately extracts the liver image structure. In post processing phase, morphological operation is performed on indeterminacy subset (I) and apply Chan-Vese (C-V) model with detection of initial contour within liver without user intervention. This resulted in liver boundary identification with high accuracy. Experiments show that, the proposed method is effective, robust and comparable with existing algorithm for liver segmentation of CT scan images. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chan-Vese model; Computed Tomography; Indeterminacy subset; Liver segmentation; Neutrosophic Set","Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Median filters; Set theory; Surgery; Tomography; Boundary identification; Chan-Vese model; Indeterminacy subset; Intensity distribution; Liver segmentation; Morphological operations; Neutrosophic sets; Virtual surgery simulations; Computerized tomography; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; human; liver; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28946992","English","Comput.

We analyze the effect of imperfect power control on the conventional timer with power control scheme, which selects the best node in a distributed manner, and quantify the extent by which it reduces the probability of selecting the best node and increases the probability of selecting a non-best node. We then redesign it to ameliorate the impact of imperfect power control. Our systematic approach eschews several ad hoc assumptions implicit in the design of the conventional timer scheme, and jointly optimizes its various parameters to maximize the probability of selecting the best node in the presence of imperfect power control. We present several structural insights, including asymptotic ones, about the optimal scheme, which also enable it to be determined with much lower computational complexity.

Variations in face image due to change in illumination, expression and presence of occlusions along with aging present many challenges to face recognition system. In this paper a new approach to robust face recognition using Polar FFT features modeled as symbolic data is proposed. Initially the face segment is cropped from the image using Viola-Jones algorithm and is converted into gray scale image of size 120 × 120 pixels. 2D-DFT is performed on pre-processed image. The dominant magnitude of 2D-DFT coefficients are computed using polar fourier transform technique and are represented as 1D P-FFT. The magnitude that represents maximum value in 1D P-FFT is considered as a feature value. The extracted feature value is used to construct a symbolic object to represent a face image. Further, a new symbolic similarity measure is devised and employed for assigning test symbolic object to a face class. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with AR database and an average accuracy of 96.25% is achieved. 100% and 97% verification rate is achieved on the ORL and LFW face databases respectively. The various experiments conducted on AR, ORL and LFW databases using the proposed symbolic data modeling approach shows that this method has a very high degree of recognition and is better compared to some of the recently reported face recognition techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Face recognition; Polar-FFT; Symbolic data modeling and analysis; Viola–Jones","Database systems; Design for testability; Fast Fourier transforms; Image processing; Image segmentation; Information analysis; DFT coefficients; Face recognition systems; Face recognition technique; Gray-scale images; Model and analysis; Processed images; Symbolic similarity; Viola - Jones algorithms; Face recognition","Kagawade, V.C.; Department of Computer Applications, Basaveshwar Engineering CollegeIndia; email: vishwanath.1312@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00313203,,PTNRA,,"English","Pattern Recogn.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023181459

Several attempts to secure 802.11 standard ends up with the inadequate security mechanisms that are vulnerable to various attacks and intrusions. Thus, integration of external defense mechanism like intrusion detection system (IDS) is inevitable. An anomaly-based IDS employs machine learning algorithms to detect attacks. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensure the performance of the classifier in terms of speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability. This paper proposes a normalized gain based IDS for MAC Intrusions (NMI) to improve the IDS performance significantly. The proposed NMI includes two primary components OFSNP and DCMI. The first component is optimal feature selection using NG and PSO (OFSNP) and the second component is Detecting and Categorizing MAC 802.11 Intrusions (DCMI) using SVM classifier. The OFSNP ranks the features using an independent measure as normalized gain (NG) and selects the optimal set of features using semi-supervised clustering (SSC). The SSC is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that uses labeled and unlabeled features simultaneously to find a group of optimal features. Using the optimal set of features, the proposed DCMI utilizes a rapid and straightforward support vector machine (SVM) learning that classifies the attacks under the appropriate classes. Thus, the proposed NMI achieves a better trade-off between detection accuracy and learning time. The experimental results show that the NMI accurately detects and classifies the 802.11 specific intrusions and also, it reduces the false positives and computation complexity by decreasing the number of features. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Intrusion detection system; MAC 802.11; Normalized gain (NG); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machine (SVM) classifier; WLAN","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Computation complexity; Intrusion Detection Systems; MAC 802.11; Normalized gains; Optimal feature selections; Semi-supervised Clustering; WLAN; Feature extraction","Kavitha, P.; Department of Information Technology, Adhiyamaan College of EngineeringIndia; email: kavitha.it@adhiyamaan.in",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969850606

The objective of this retrospective study was to improve the sensitivity and specificity of smaller polyp measurement in CTC using image processing techniques. Methods: A domain knowledge-based method has been implemented with hybrid method of colon segmentation, morphological image processing operators for detecting the colonic structures, and the decision-making system for delineating the smaller polyp-based on a priori knowledge. Results: The method was applied on 45 CTC dataset. The key finding was that the smaller polyps were accurately measured. In addition to 6–9 mm range, polyps of even <5 mm were also detected. The results were validated qualitatively and quantitatively using both 2D MPR and 3D view. Implementation was done on a high-performance computer with parallel processing.

The evolution of steel microstructure through various heat treatment processes is an important factor in controlling properties and performance of steel. Extensive experimentations have been performed to enhance the properties of steel by customizing heat treatment processes. However, experimental analyses are always associated with high resource requirements in terms of cost and time. As an alternative solution, we propose an image processing-based technique for refinement of raw plain carbon steel microstructure images, into a digital form, usable in experiments related to heat treatment processes of steel in diverse applications. The proposed work follows the conventional steps practiced by materials engineers in manual refinement of steel images; and it appropriately utilizes basic image processing techniques (including filtering, segmentation, opening, and clustering) to automate the whole process. The proposed refinement of steel microstructure images is aimed to enable computer-aided simulations of heat treatment of plain carbon steel, in a timely and cost-efficient manner; hence it is beneficial for the materials and metallurgy industry.

Underground mine tunnels offers several distinctive features that are quite different from regular rail/road tunnels. While several studies have been performed on electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in tunnel environments, there is limited understanding of the inter-working of tunnel dimension with long range tilt variations (a typically feature of coal mines) on the propagation characteristics of wireless radio waves. In this paper, we study and describe a new hybrid multimode model for wireless communication applications in underground coal mines; and analyze it with respect to significant parameters such as operating frequency, mine tunnel size, transmitter–receiver position, electrical parameters and antenna gain. The characterization results suggest that the mine tunnel size and transmitter–receiver position affects the signal behavior significantly. However, the electrical parameters have almost negligible effects on the propagation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Channel modeling; Mine communication; Signals in mine; Wireless network","Coal; Electric network parameters; Radio waves; Signal receivers; Transmitters; Wave propagation; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channel model; Electrical parameter; Mine communication; Propagation characteristics; Underground coal mine; Wave propagation in tunnels; Wireless communication applications; Wireless technologies; Coal mines","Ranjan, A.; Department of Mining Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: alokranjan007@hotmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022027496

One fundamental application of WSNs is event detection in a Region of Interest (RoI). A set of sensors are deployed to monitor any events inside RoI. In such monitoring applications, both the quality of detection as well as resource requirement in terms of sensors must be optimized while satisfying a certain level of detection guaranty. Therefore, carrying out an optimal sensor deployment is a challenging task for achieving a certain coverage quality with minimum energy consumption and network cost. This paper proposes analytical models for critically analyzing the performance of different deployment techniques to provide insight on the design parameters and system behaviors. Mathematical formulations have been derived to measure the quality of coverage, energy consumption and network cost of geometrical deployment patterns in terms of different metrics; namely, size of RoI, number of sensors and their sensing range. The deployment patterns are modeled by using different shapes of mathematical geometry such square, tri-tilling-hexagon and hexagon. Simulations are carried out using MATLAB considering realistic parameter setting and results are comparatively analyzed for deployment techniques. Analysis of results attests the superiority of Tri Hexagon Tiling (THT) deployment in terms of 2-coverage, energy consumption and network cost to the square and hexagon deployments. In terms of 3-coverage and 4-coverage, hexagon deployment is better as compared to THT and square deployments. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Analytical models; Deployment analysis; Energy consumption; Network cost; Sensor deployment; Wireless sensor networks","Analytical models; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy utilization; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Deployment analysis; Mathematical formulation; Minimum energy consumption; Monitoring applications; Network costs; Resource requirements; Sensor deployment; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Kumar, S.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: skdohare@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020751051

It is well known that a feedback-based beamforming scheme aids channel adaptive signaling in wireless communication systems and provides large performance gain. If the feedback information is always decoded error free, then the beamforming technique reduces to a best transmit aperture selection scheme [termed error free optimal weighting scheme (EFOWS)]. However, due to a practically unguided environment, the feedback link is prone to error and leads to incorrect aperture selection, due to which diversity gain is lost. Therefore, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive error tolerant weighting (ETW) scheme is introduced and is optimized according to the SNR of the feedback link. In comparison to the considered arbitrarily fixed SNR-based ETW scheme, the proposed SNR adaptive ETW scheme provides significant performance gain (coding gain) almost equivalent to EFOWS. Closed-form expressions for the upper bound of the asymptotic average bit-error rate (BER) and the ergodic capacity of the proposed schemes are obtained with the help of order statistics. By minimizing the derived average BER, optimized transmit weights for the transmit apertures are achieved under erroneous feedback over Gamma-Gamma fading with pointing errors. Further, numerical results show that the proposed new error tolerant scheme outperforms the well-known repetition coding (referred to as the uniformly weighted scheme). © 2009-2012 OSA.","BER; Feedback; FSO links; Gamma-Gamma fading; MISO system; Order statistics; Subcarrier intensity modulation","Adaptive optics; Beamforming; Bit error rate; Error statistics; Errors; Fading channels; Feedback; Optical communication; Signaling; Wireless telecommunication systems; FSO links; Gamma-gamma fading; MISO systems; Order statistics; Subcarrier intensity modulation; Signal to noise ratio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19430620,,,,"English","J.of Opt.

First, monocular video taken using a stationary camera is given as the input to Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based foreground detector. Then a grid is used to measure the number of foreground pixels. If the pixels inside the grid is greater than a pre-assigned threshold, the grid will sense the presence of a vehicle. When the presence of a vehicle is identified within a frame, the region within the bounding box (created by foreground detector), which contain the RGB image of the vehicle is cropped and saved. SURF features of the stored frames are extracted and used for training classifier for 5 vehicle classes, namely, two wheelers, three wheelers, cars, Heavy Motor Vehicle (HMV) and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV). For classifying a test video, frames with vehicles are extracted using the grid and SURF features are extracted and applied to the classifier. When the feature of test vehicle image becomes closer to that of class, the vehicle will be categorized into that class.

Subsequently, the pupil is segmented from the smoothened iris images, using wavelet transform. From the experimental results, it is clearly evident that the proposed method is not only efficient in pupil segmentation, irrespective of its shape but also capable of handling low contrast images or images with noise.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type which satisfies these requirements. But the two main performance parameters of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are near to the ground for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of a patch antenna is 1-2dB. Most straightforward approach of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to generation of surface waves. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antenna with metamaterial on the substrate for multiband application is proposed. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0. The performance parameters analysed are bandwidth, gain and return loss.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to capture structural abnormalities in human brain regions. In this work, segmentation of ventricle region from Schizophrenic MR brain images was carried out using optimized energy minimization framework. The images considered in this work are obtained from Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) database. Initially, the original images are subjected to simultaneous bias correction and segmentation using multiplicative intrinsic component optimization. The ventricles are extracted from other internal brain structures using this method. The obtained results are validated against the ground truth images. Results show that, multiplicative intrinsic component optimization method is able to segment ventricle from normal and SZ images. The correlation of ventricle area with ground truth is high (R = 0.99). It is noticed that SZ subjects have increased ventricle area compared to that of normal subjects. The high value of rand index (0.98) along with low value of global consistency error and variation of information shows the efficiency of the proposed method. The feature area extracted from the ventricle seems to be significant; hence it may be clinically supportive in the diagnosis of Schizophrenic subjects. © 2017 IEEE.","bias correction; multiplicative intrinsic component optimization; Schizophrenia; segmentation","Brain; Brain mapping; Diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal processing; Bias correction; Biomedical research; Energy minimization; Global consistency; Neurological disorders; Optimization method; Schizophrenia; Variation of informations; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047406,,,"English","Int.

Many existing methods are there. Abnormal events are those which cannot be well represented. For example, if a flight is hijacked or it is damaged, it is due to some abnormal activities. Abnormal activities may occur due to human intervention or due to some weather conditions. So in this system we are using abnormal detector to detect the events. Abnormal patterns are extracted from incoming events. The major contribution to this paper are: 1) In this abnormal detector is used to identify abnormal events. In this complexity is high in video events due to the presence of noise.

This research work introduces a new model, IBE-ECC that administers the energy of sensor nodes with faster authentication process. Signature verification model is deployed to achieve faster authentication process. Nevertheless, the public key-based strategies eliminate the security process but their verification process takes larger time. Therefore, authentication speed is a major constraint of our research endeavor. The proposed scheme is design to achieve high security and fast authentication with energy efficiency.

Further, to improve the speed of the authentication, it reduces the signature size so that it would accelerate signature verification faster. Hence, the proposed scheme will provide a secure key management, energy efficiency, fast authentication and additionally, computation overhead and communication costs are minimized.

Major operations are preprocessing, random selection of coordinates and genetic algorithm.

Segment the bacilli called candidate bacilli using its characteristics from the image using Particle Swarm Optimization technique, depending on pixel intensities. The candidate bacilli are then grouped together using connected component analysis after using morphological operations. Detection of Tuberculosis bacilli from sputum smear by random forest technique is a prominent method used in diagnosing the tuberculosis by classifying the subject samples.

This paper aims to extract features from the different renal abnormalities to discriminate between the normal and abnormal conditions. Two filters, median and wiener filter are used to remove the speckle noise in US (ultrasound) images. A picture quality performance technique is implemented to identify the quality of the images. Peak to signal noise ratio (PSNR) and Mean squared error (MSR) is used to verify the enhanced images. The preprocessed images are then segmented using FCM (fuzzy c-means clustering technique) which yields better results to find Region of interest (ROI). The statistical features along with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features and Texture features are extracted and analyzed.

India has 17% of world's population suffering from breast cancer. World Health Organization's International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimates that more than 4,00,000 women die every year due to breast cancer. Thus early identification of breast cancer plays a vital role in reducing the mortality rate. Medical infrared thermography is gaining popularity as it can detect abnormality at an early stage when compared to mammogram. In this work an attempt has been made to distinguish healthy and pathological subjects using Bidirectional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) and uniform Rotated Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). Frontal thermogram images are pre-processed using anisotropic diffusion filtering which preserves sharp edges, fine details and effectively removes noise. Level set segmentation technique is applied on pre-processed image to obtain the required Region Of Interest (ROI). The delineated ROI's are subjected to BEMD where the image is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residue. IMF1 is considered for further processing as it contains maximum edge information about the image. Texture analysis is performed on IMF1 using uniform RLBP technique to obtain feature vector comprising of 59 unique elements. The dimensionality of features is reduced to 20 using Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). The subjects are classified using Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) classifier with different kernel functions and the classifier results are evaluated based on classifier performance measures. Analysis is performed on 43 healthy and 24 cancerous subjects chosen from DMR (Database of Mastology Research) database. The experimental results obtained by LSSVM classifier using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with σ2=3D0.5 and γ=3D1 outstands by achieving 89% accuracy. Hence the proposed system effectively distinguishes healthy and pathological subjects. © 2017 IEEE.","BEMD; IMF; LSSVM; RLBP; Thermogram","Diseases; Functions; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; International cooperation; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Anisotropic diffusion filtering; BEMD; International agency for research on cancers; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Least square support vector machines; LSSVM; RLBP; Thermogram; Medical imaging",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049790,,,"English","Proc.

Early diagnosis of cancer prevents morbidity and mortality rate. Thermography is an additional tool for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Low contrast, poor Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and complex breast boundaries are the inherent limitation of breast thermal images which makes segmentation a challenging task. In this work, an attempt is made to extract edge map from Type-I and Type-II breast images using Geometric Non linear Diffussion Filter (GNLDF) method to aid accurate segmentation. GNLDF is an iterative nonlinear filter which reduces the noise and preserves the edges based on the local image topology. The extracted edge maps are validated against the input images using betametric and Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD). Result showed that edge map extracted using GNLDF method is distinct for both types of images. The beta metric and GMSD values are found to be 0.29 and 0.004 indicating high resemblance of filtered image edges with the input images. GNLDF method has improved the SNR of Type-I and Type-II images by 35dB compared to Perona Malik method. Hence, the edge map extracted using GNLD filter shall aid accurate segmentation of breast tissue to identify pathology for clinical interpretation and diagnosis. © 2017 IEEE.","Beta metric; Breast thermography; GMSD and SNR; GNLDF; Perona Malik","Bandpass filters; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image processing; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Thermography (imaging); Beta metric; Breast boundary; Geometric non-linear; GMSD and SNR; GNLDF; Gradient magnitude; Inherent limitations; Perona Malik; Image enhancement",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049790,,,"English","Proc.

The diagnosis of OSA requires an overnight sleep experiment in a laboratory. However, due to limitations in relation to the number of labs and beds available, patients often need to wait a long time before being diagnosed and eventually treated. In addition, the unfamiliar environment and restricted mobility when a patient is being tested with a polysomnogram may disturb their sleep, resulting in an incomplete or corrupted test. Therefore, it is posed that a PSG conducted in the patient's home would be more reliable and convenient. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the e-Health system. In this paper, we implement an IoT-based wireless polysomnography system for sleep monitoring, which utilizes a battery-powered, miniature, wireless, portable, and multipurpose recorder. A Java-based PSG recording program in the personal computer is designed to save several bio-signals and transfer them into the European data format. These PSG records can be used to determine a patient's sleep stages and diagnose OSA. This system is portable, lightweight, and has low power-consumption. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed PSG system, a comparison was made between the standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system. Several healthy volunteer patients participated in the PSG experiment and were monitored by both the standard PSG-Alice 5 Diagnostic Sleep System and the proposed system simultaneously, under the supervision of specialists at the Sleep Laboratory in Taipei Veteran General Hospital. A comparison of the results of the time-domain waveform and sleep stage of the two systems shows that the proposed system is reliable and can be applied in practice. The proposed system can facilitate the long-Term tracing and research of personal sleep monitoring at home. © 2013 IEEE.","Internet of Things; Java; Polysomnography (PSG); sleep monitoring; wireless","Computer software; Diagnosis; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Java programming language; Monitoring; Patient treatment; Personal computers; Radio; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Biomedical monitoring; JAVA; Polysomnography; Sleep apnea; Sleep monitoring; Wireless communications; Sleep research","Prasad, M.; Centre for Artificial Intelligence, School of Software, University of Technology SydneyAustralia; email: mukesh.nctu@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032435870

However, it has some disadvantages. The major issues are convergence to the local optima, that is, the quality of the clustering result is highly dependent on the initialization. Another problem is that the clustering will produce different results in different independent runs. The number of clusters have to be specified in advance. But in the real application, it is tough to determine the parameters in advance. This research is intended to develop a parallel clustering algorithm which is capable of clustering large data sets.

In this paper, we propose the use of Gaussian posteriorgram of VTLN-warped spectral features for a Queryby-Example Spoken Term Detection (QbE-STD).

This GMM framework does not require phoneme-level transcription and hence, it can be useful for unsupervised tasks. We propose the iterative approach for VTLN warping factor estimation with two GMM training approaches, namely, Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Deterministic Annealing-Expectation Maximization (DAEM). The VTLN-warped Gaussian posteriorgram gave the better QbESTD performance. The performance of TIMIT QbE-STD was investigated with different evaluation factors, such as a number of Gaussian components in GMM, various local constraints, and a number of iterations in VTLN warping factor estimation. VTLNwarped Gaussian posteriorgram reduces the speaker-specific variation in Gaussian posteriorgram and hence, it is expected to give better performance than Gaussian posteriorgram. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Maximum principle; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Deterministic annealing expectation maximizations; Expectation Maximization; Gaussian components; Gaussian Mixture Model; Number of iterations; Speaker normalization; Spoken term detections; Vocal tract length normalization; Gaussian distribution",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9780992862671,,,"English","Euro.

Vehicular detection and classification is decisive as it can guide in traffic control and gathering of traffic info that can be used in intelligent transportation systems. Vehicular classification poses a thought-provoking problem as vehicles have high intra-class variation and comparatively low inter-class variation and it is time consuming, varying performance under different weather conditions etc. Hence there is a demand for employing innovative efficient data collection technique which will give the advantageous continuous data collection with acceptable level of accuracy.

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed - such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

WSN consists of small nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. In WSN, clustering is used as an effective technique to achieve scalability, self-organization, power saving, channel access, routing etc. Lifetime of sensor nodes determines the lifetime of the network and is crucial for the sensing capability. Clustering is the key technique used to extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In this proposed method, the node next to the present cluster head is selected as the new cluster head if its energy is greater than the threshold energy. Moreover all the nodes used in this method are mobile nodes. Mobile nodes increases the scope of gathering updated information. Mobile nodes also have a chance of entering remote area where cluster head cannot reach them. In this case the nodes die. In the proposed method this problem is solved, whenever the nodes tends to move out of the cluster, the nodes generates a random angle to which it is redirected. This approach will increase the network lifetime and will provide high throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","Clustering; Mobile Nodes; Network; Routing; Scalability; Wireless Communication","Network routing; Networks (circuits); Routing protocols; Scalability; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clustering; Mobile nodes; Mobile sensor networks; Routing; Self organizations; Updated informations; Wireless communication capabilities; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks",,"Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538622155,,,"English","Ind.

In such networks, base station (BS) density in a particular area is more compared to the traditional macrocell network for better quality of service. However, increase in BS density results in more frequent handovers, and thus causes handoff failures. To address these challenges, knowledge of mobile user's velocity is a significant requirement. In this work, we develop a velocity estimation strategy based on sojourn time. Sojourn time is defined as the time span in which a user is served by one BS before it handed over to another BS for better services. The sojourn time method is used in this analysis as it considers both handover count and sojourn time information in estimating the user velocity. Here, we consider that BSS are randomly distributed by homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), and their coverage is modeled by using Poisson-Voronoi tessellation. Using these statistics, we first derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) based on sojourn time and later we determine an ML estimator, which is asymptotically unbiased. We validate our approach by simulation in which we show the tight closeness of ML estimator asymptotic variance with CRLB. Also, we compare the proposed ML estimator with CRLB of velocity estimator based on sojourn time and handover count. Our results illustrate that proposed ML estimator based on sojourn time outperforms the CRLB based on handover count. © 2017 IEEE.","Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB); Heterogeneous networks (HetNets); Long term evolution (LTE); Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE); Sojourn time; Velocity estimation","Cramer-Rao bounds; Estimation; Heterogeneous networks; Interoperability; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Maximum likelihood; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Velocity; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cramer-rao lower bound; Heterogeneous network (HetNets); Maximum likelihood estimators (MLE); Sojourn time; Velocity estimation; Maximum likelihood estimation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053568,,,"English","Natl.

The primary objective of these algorithms is to reduce the number of unnecessary handovers such as ping-pong handovers which diminish the network performance. We compare and provide statistical analysis for these algorithms using various metrics and show that in a topology which induces ping-pongs, A1A3RSRP reduces the number of ping-pong handovers by an average of 33.33% as compared to A3RSRP and increases the average aggregate system throughput by an average of 3.43%.

LTE-Wi-Fi Aggregation or LWA) has become one of the most prominent solutions in the era of 5G to boost network capacity and improve end user's quality of experience. LWA offers flexible resource scheduling decisions for steering user traffic via LTE and Wi-Fi links. In this work, we propose a Collocated LTE/WLAN Radio Level Integration architecture at IP layer (C-LWIP), an enhancement over 3GPP non-collocated LWIP architecture. We have evaluated C-LWIP performance in various link aggregation strategies (LASs). A C-LWIP node (i.e., the node having collocated, aggregated LTE eNodeB and Wi-Fi access point functionalities) is implemented in NS-3 which introduces a traffic steering layer (i.e., Link Aggregation Layer) for efficient integration of LTE and Wi-Fi. Using extensive simulations, we verified the correctness of C-LWIP module in NS-3 and evaluated the aggregation benefits over standalone LTE andWi-Fi networks with respect to varying number of users and traffic types. We found that split bearer performs equivalently to switched bearer for UDP flows and switched bearer outperforms split bearer in the case of TCP flows. Also, we have enumerated the potential challenges to be addressed for unleashing C-LWIP capabilities.

Spectrum utilization can be enhanced considerably by allowing a secondary user to use a licensed band when the primary user (PU) is not present. Cognitive radio (CR) promotes the efficient use of the spectrum. Cyclostationary detection is a method for detecting primary user transmissions by taking advantage of the cyclostationary features of the received signals. SC-FDMA is a multiple-access technique with low peak-to average-power ratio (PAPR) and reasonable complexity. A spectrum sensing technique for the discovery of the SC-FDMA signals is developed using a metric that makes use of the cyclostationary features of SC-FDMA signals. This metric is compared with a threshold to deduce the presence or absence of PU. The threshold is calculated using the Bayesian detection. The Bayesian decision rule is to minimise the expected posterior cost. The superiority of Bayesion detector over Neyman-Pearson detector, energy detector and cyclic prefix (CP) detector is compared. The performance of the detector is presented for additive white Gaussian noise and multipath Rayleigh fading channels.

With different operating conditions, interference, obstacles and type of building materials used, it is difficult to predict the path loss components in an indoor environment, which are crucial for the network design. It has been observed that the indoor path loss models proposed for western countries cannot be directly used in Indian scenarios due to variations in building materials utilized, floor plans, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a non-deterministic statistical indoor path loss model-Tata Indoor Path Loss Model (T-IPLM) which can be used for the 2.4-2.5 GHz, Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. To propose and validate, we have conducted several drive tests with different conditions such as busy office premise with obstacles, open office premise, corridor, canteen, and multistorey office locations, etc. We have also compared T-IPLM with popular path loss models such as ITU-R and Log-distance; T-IPLM matches closely with the drive test results as compared to other models.

In the UWB literature, non-coherent energy detector (ED) receiver is proposed to reduce receiver implementation complexity by avoiding the complex channel estimation process and relaxing the precise synchronization requirement. However, the ED receiver performance is sensitive to the integration interval, and too large or small value of integration interval degrades the UWB receiver performance. In this paper, we propose a non-coherent UWB receiver by exploiting the cluster-sparsity of the received UWB signal. The proposed receiver structure enhances the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver output as compared to the ED by barring inter-clusters noise accumulation. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed non-coherent receiver for time-hopping binary pulse position modulation UWB system is analyzed using IEEE 802.15.4a channel. The proposed receiver design does not require any training and optimization process, and provides 1-3 dB BER performance gain as compared to the conventional ED receiver. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bit error rate; Broadband networks; Complex networks; Error statistics; Low power electronics; Radio communication; Radio receivers; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Binary pulse position modulation; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Low power application; Non-coherent receivers; Precise synchronizations; Receiver implementation; Short-range wireless communications; Ultra-wideband technology; Ultra-wideband (UWB)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053568,,,"English","Natl.

In a bid to cope with the increasing data demands, the mobile network operators and the research community, alongside 3GPP, are working towards standardizing the operation of LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band by opportunistically supplementing the licensed LTE carrier with a carrier in the unlicensed band - a feature named Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA). Since this unlicensed band already hosts well-established technologies like Wi-Fi, a need arises for a fair coexistence mechanism between LAA and Wi-Fi users. In this regard, we propose a novel duty-cycle based fair coexistence condition that not only facilitates Wi-Fi and LAA to be fair neighbours, but also maximizes the LAA throughput in the unlicensed band. To the best of our knowledge, this condition is the first to provide a fairness bound which gives a fair duty-cycle for LAA and Wi-Fi transmissions in the unlicensed band. The simulation results obtained validate our analytical model. Furthermore, the derived condition shows that the LAA throughput in the unlicensed band can be improved by around 65 to 1350 Kbps, when there are ten or fewer active users in a Wi-Fi cell of 20 MHz bandwidth, over the current state of the art coexistence scheme that facilitates proportional fairness between LAA and Wi-Fi in the unlicensed band. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Carrier aggregations; Consumer expectations; MAC layer protocols; Mobile network operators; Modulation schemes; Proportional fairness; Research communities; Spatial multiplexing; Long Term Evolution (LTE)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053568,,,"English","Natl.

The chances of recovery can be well improved if it is possible to diagnose the cancer at its early stages. Cancer detection is conventionally done by invasive procedures like biopsy, but it causes lot of discomforts for the patient. Here Hyperspectral Images (HSI) based noninvasive alternative for biopsy is introduced, it is also applicable as a tumor margin assessment during image-guided surgery. HSI is emerged as a promising tool for cancer detection and in tumor margin assessment. The key technique employed here is Marko Random Field (MRF), for depth wise segmentation and it is followed by malignant tissue extraction using Chan-Vese Active Contour method. Here MRF and active contour methods are respectively utilizes local and global features of the subject and the effectiveness of the segmentation at discrete input conditions can be improved by incorporating local optimizations scheme with the segmentation. It helps to make the segmentation more effective and accurate, by compensating the geometrical (ie, containment and exclusion) and distance constraints in the input samples. It is essential because of the spatially-recurring, multi-regional boundary structure of tumor margins. The heterogeneity in the tissue samples can be well defined by the optimization values and it is also be used for tissue classification. Finally feature of the malignant tissue is also extracted for having a clear inference of the subject.

To address this problem, we have come up with a solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places, it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs. Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to identify the intruder and help in catching him.

This method is based on k-means (KM) clustering and thresholding techniques. SAR images have huge employment in topography, remote sensing, and subsurface imaging. The segmentation of SAR images is always demanding because of the noise present in it. Speckle noise is the common noise present in SAR images. The median filter is utilized for noise removal. Clustering methods are customary segmentation techniques, but they do not give meticulous results. Hence we have performed image filtering and traditional thresholding methods along with clustering technique for effective results. In our proposed method, we have used k-means clustering method and Otsu thresholding for effective segmentation. Finally, morphological closing is performed for accurate results.

For this a new idea is proposed which aims at designing a Gabor filter that makes accurate detection of diseases. We use an efficient pipelined architecture for input. Image segmentation for the detection of diseases is done using Gabor filter that in turn uses shift-add CORDIC algorithm for making the designing of Gabor filter easier. In addition to this algorithm, we use a new algorithm called Variable Thresholding algorithm that sets a threshold value during the decision making period. The algorithm is named variable because, the threshold value can be varied depending upon the diseases we are going to detect. All these algorithms are written in VHDL Language in MODELSIM software, which makes the designing and decision making process more effective. This technique is also implemented on FPGA/CPLD kit that shows us the presence of disease manually through lighting of LED's.

Level set methods and active contour models (ACMs) plays a vital role in the applications of image processing, robot vision, object recognition and computer vision. DRLSE model has recently become a powerful technique for image segmentation. DRLSE model eliminates the re-initialization problem in conventional level set method. DRLSE has been applied successfully into some fields like medical imaging, remote sensing and computer vision. However when it is applied to noisy images, It leads to significant drawbacks (number of iterations and computational time is increased). In order to avoid disadvantages of conventional DRLSE, we introduce a method to combine the median filtering, k-means clustering and DRLSE model. Firstly a noise free image is extracted by median filtering; then k-means clustering is applied to denoised image. The last stage is that the DRLSE model is applied for the extraction of object boundaries with pre segmentation process. The accuracy and the efficiency of the algorithm can be described on various noisy magnetic resonance (MR) brain images.

Still the exact cause of the breast cancer remain unknown. Early detection and diagnosis is the best and most effective strategy to control the tumor progression. Mammography is the currently recommended imaging method for early determination and diagnosis of breast malignancy. A mammogram can identify abnormal areas in the breast that look like a cancer but turns out to be normal, this leads to false positive. Mammogram images are found to be difficult to interpret so a CAD is becoming an increasingly important tool to assist radiologist in the mammographic lesion interpretation. Preprocessing was considered as an important step in mammogram image analysis. Accuracy of preprocessing will determine the success of the remaining process such as segmentation, classification etc. In this paper, mean, median, adaptive median, Gaussian and wiener denoising filters are used to remove salt and pepper, speckle and Gaussian noises from a mammogram image and these filters were compared based on the parameters such as PSNR, MSE and SNR to determine which filter is better for removing these noises in mammogram images. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive median filter; CAD; Gaussian filter; Mammogram; Mean filter; Median filter; MSE; Preprocessing; PSNR; SNR; wiener filter","Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Computer aided design; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Image segmentation; Mammography; Medical imaging; X ray screens; Adaptive median filter; Gaussian filters; Mammogram; Mean filter; Preprocessing; PSNR; WIENER filters; Median filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055555,,,"English","Conf.

The proposed approach takes into account different types of fruits. The main goal is to come up with a method for classifying these different types of fruits accurately and efficiently. Images are preprocessed in order to separate the fruit in the foreground from the background. Texture features from Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and statistical color features are extracted from the segmented image. Two types of features are combined in a single feature descriptor. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model is trained using these feature descriptors extracted from the training dataset.

When the medical image is transmitted through insecure public network, there is a chance for tampering medical images. Therefore, it is crucial to check the integrity of medical images to prevent any unauthorized modification. To check the integrity we calculate cryptographic hash function of ROI (Region Of Interest) by using SHA algorithm. The hash value (H1) will be embedded in the RONI using discrete wavelet transform. By comparing the hash value at receiver side, we can check the integrity of medical image. If any tampering occurs, the hash function does not match. This paper proposes a new method to improve the security. The modified medical image is embedded in an ordinary looking image by spatial reversible steganography method. It helps to conceal the existence of secret medical data. It ensures that the eavesdroppers will not have any suspicion that medical image is hidden in that image.

Pressure, venous and arterial leg ulcers are considered in this study. For this purpose, chronic wound images acquired by digital camera are enhanced using color correction, noise removal and color homogenization. Enhanced images in Cb color channel of YCbCr color space is used to extract wound bed with factorization based segmentation approach. Binary classification is performed to classify pressure ulcers and leg ulcers. The obtained results showed that the proposed segmentation method is capable of converging exactly to irregular wound boundaries.

But due to the heavy licensing fee and the cost of setting up new base stations, service providers have started to resort to the unlicensed spectrum, particularly the ISM band to offload some of the data from the LTE network locally, in areas of heavy user base. There does not exist a long-term and standard solution although some efforts have been made to enable cooperation between the different networks like LTE and IEEE 802.11. Thus, a new architecture and accompanying routing protocol is proposed to enable a tighter integration between different networks to improve QoS and overall performance of the combined heterogeneous network.

The next big challenge is to represent these images mathematically so that a classification algorithm can be put into place to classify them. In this paper, the task of segmenting flower images from their natural background is achieved by proposing and implementing a segmentation method based on average color and the variance of the color distribution. Flower images are encoded into mathematical feature vectors using combined color and GIST features. Tests involving the aforementioned features individually along with several other image features, also tested individually and in combination, show that the proposed representation works best for the task. Finally, a classification model, based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), is trained. The trained model can distinguish between 12 different classes of flowers.

DC and RF performance is observed for both the devices. It is shown that the DC parameters like drain current, transconductance are nearly same for both the devices. Coming to the RF performance, the maximum cut-off frequency of the normal gate HEMT is 24 GHz at the drain voltage of 20 V and the gate voltage of 2 V where as the maximum cut-off frequency of the T-shaped gate HEMT is 47 GHz at the same drain and gate voltage. For T-shaped HEMT, it is observed that maximum cutoff frequency is double of the normal gate HEMT. Maximum frequency of oscillation for normal gate HEMT is 95 GHz and for T-shaped gate HEMT it is 115 GHz at same drain and gate voltage i.e. 2 V and 20 V. At the operating frequency 5 GHz, the minimum noise figure of the normal gate HEMT is 0.13 dB. At the same operating frequency the minimum noise figure of the T-shaped gate HEMT is 0.05 dB.

Detection of brain tumor has become a challenging task to compete with. In this paper an automated method for detecting brain abnormalities and tumor edema has been proposed using sobel edge detection method. Various MRI images have been used as inputs here. Here, first of all the pre-processing of image has been done to cut out any discrepancy in it and then the image has been smoothened using median filter. We have proposed an appropriate method to find threshold value using standard deviation and we get an intensity map. Now we recomputed standard deviation for this intensity map. Using this we will calculate an average intensity of the pixels those are above this standard deviation. Finally, this computed average intensity will be taken as the threshold value to segment the tumor from the original MRI images. The intensity value greater than and equal to the calculated threshold value is set to 255 and less than is set to 0, this segments our abnormal region which is tumor. At last, we use sobel edge detector to identify the border of the tumor region. The outcome of the proposed method improves efficacy and accuracy for detection of brain tumors. © 2017 IEEE.","Average Intensity; MRI Images; Sobel Operator; Standard Deviation; Tumor Detection","Brain; Computer circuits; Edge detection; Image processing; Image segmentation; Median filters; Statistics; Tumors; Average Intensity; MRI Image; Sobel operator; Standard deviation; Tumor detection; Magnetic resonance imaging",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049660,,,"English","Proc.

The high-data rate applications running through mobile devices together with the radio access devices at the base stations (BS) cause a significant growth in energy consumption in the network accounting a large share of network operation expenditure (OpEx), as well as increased carbon emissions. Unlike an interference-free network, in the IL cellular network, a monotonically increase of the transmission power does not necessarily improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. For the analysis of the EE an information theoretic approach is applied and represented as a function of the BS transmission power considering the interference signals. A gradient based optimal level solution for the BS transmission power is derived to maximize EE. A network operator can significantly reduce the energy cost by setting the transmission power of the BS at the optimum level. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy Efficiency; Interference-limited Cellular Networks; Operation Expenditure; Poisson point process; Spectral Efficiency","4G mobile communication systems; Base stations; Energy utilization; Information theory; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; High data rate applications; Information-theoretic approach; Interference signal; LTE-Advanced systems; Operation Expenditure; Poisson point process; Spectral efficiencies; Energy efficiency",,"Stankovic Z.Z.Doncov N.S.Milovanovic B.D.Dimitrijevic T.Z.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538618004,,,"English","Int.

Most of the muscles in the palmar region of the hand are intrinsic, and hence noninvasive EMG measurements give minimal information. In this study, an attempt is made to quantify the variations in thermal profile of the hand pre- and post- fatigue using infrared thermography. Subjects are tested using pinch grip based isometric contraction of the hand until fatigue. Baseline and post-fatigue thermal images are acquired using a Meditherm IRIS infrared camera. The process of image segmentation is carried out to delineate the dominant hand from the background. Features such as average temperature and kurtosis are extracted from the segmented images. Results show that there are wide variations in the intensities depicted by the thermal profile of each subject's hand. A decrease of 1.22% in median hand temperature of the palmar hand is observed. Similarly, a 1.17% reduction in temperature of the dorsal hand is detected post-fatigue. The kurtosis of the thermal profiles increases by 5.39% in the palmar hand and 6.63% in the dorsal hand post-fatigue. The statistical Student T-test performed on these features indicate that the decrease in average temperature is non-statistically significant (P>0.05); however, the increase in kurtosis is statistically significant (P<0.05). Infrared thermography appears to be a promising tool to measure the state of activation of muscle groups using thermal profiles.","Fatigue; Image processing; Infrared thermography; Upper Extremity Musculoskeletal Disorder","Bioinformatics; Diseases; Ergonomics; Fatigue of materials; Higher order statistics; Image processing; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; EMG measurement; Infra-red cameras; Isometric contractions; Minimal information; Segmented images; Student t tests; Thermal profiles; Upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders; Thermography (imaging)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353229,,,"English","ACM Int.

Atmospheric disturbances have a significant impact on performance of FSO Link which results in the degradation of the laser beam. In this paper, the analysis and investigation based on experimental set-up for a Free Space optical communication link at wavelength of 532nm and 850nm is being carried out which helps to evaluate the link performance and further improvement in link performance is done by experimental arrangement. The FSO link in case of 532nm tolerate attenuation up to 66.12 dB/km at the loss of -0.04 dB and rain rate of 2.3592mm/min. whereas 850nm tolerate attenuation up to 17.5 dB/km at the loss of -0.01 dB and at the same rain rate as in 532nm. The experimental investigation is carried out by analyzing the receiver current, exposed length and rain rate conditions. It is concluded that the proposed FSO link of 532nm having more attenuation than 850nm wavelength and in the both the cases loss is assumed of -0.01 dB. There is an increase in attenuation when rain rate increases. The rain rate over the exposed lengths depends on the different rain drop sizes. So it can be said that visible wavelengths due to its low cost, low power consumption and easy detection is good for short range communication purposes than infrared wavelengths. © 2017 IEEE.","Free Space Optics (FSO); Rain attenuation; Rain rates; Visible Light Communication","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Laser beams; Light; Optical links; Rain; Space optics; Visible light communication; Wireless telecommunication systems; Atmospheric disturbance; Experimental arrangement; Experimental investigations; Free Space Optical communication; Free space optics; Rain attenuation; Rain rates; Short-range communication; Optical communication","Soni, G.; Head-Center of Excellence (R and D Wing), Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amritsar College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: gaurav.ece@acetedu.in","Niranjan Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063994,,,"English","Proc.

The GPS based monitoring of trains will help to track trains, better scheduling and avoids any mishaps. In the existing system, the scheduling of trains, traffic railway signalling is manual and less accurate in predicting train arrival destination time and no/or very less emergency alert broadcast sent to from and to station in case of any mishaps. Automated Train scheduling will be incorporated with the help of GPS system and if there are concurrent trains running in the same path, scheduling is automated to avoid deadlock scenario and train waiting issues and hence train travelling time can be reduced. Traffic Signalling is better handled with additional proactive measures by sending broadcast message to the nearest from or to stations with current latitude location details of train. The nearest station where train has been halted can be found by using the shortest distance using proposed Hybrid shortest distance algorithm using latitude conversion to weight and applying dijkstra to find the shortest distance. Accurate Train schedule timings are tabulated and expected train arrival at the destination will be precise enough as tabulations are dynamic. Hence necessary steps can be carried out for false traffic and immediate medical services can be provided for mishaps and reduces the number of accidents. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Accidents; Automation; Embedded systems; Railroad accidents; Railroads; Scheduling; Transportation; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadcast messages; Distance algorithm; Existing systems; Proactive measures; Railway signalling; Railway transportation; Transportation system; Wireless communications; Data communication systems","Sridhar, T.; Computer Science and Engineering, SATHYABAMA UNIVERSITYIndia; email: sridharthalapanani@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

It is widely used in image processing, video surveillance, cyber forensic, video browsing, and video indexing and retrieval applications. Though the state-of-the art computer vision algorithms provide efficient solutions for extraction of key frames, but often demands very high computational power as it involves computing very high dimensional image features. On the other hand, with the widespread use of Big Data and IOT applications, the storage, management and accessing of large volume, high velocity and variety of video data is increasing at exponential rates. Therefore, in order to address this problem we propose optimization of key frame extraction algorithms on Apache Hadoop distributed framework. As the process of extracting key-frames involves simultaneous execution of image processing tasks, the Hadoop framework divides and distributes these tasks to multiple nodes of the cluster. The MapReduce programming model has been redefined to perform the tasks of identifying key frames by color histogram difference between successive frames. The proposed optimized Hadoop's MapReduce algorithm has been tested on a data set of 1000 news videos each having approximately a length of 10 minutes. A performance speed up of 7 has been achieved by varying the size of the cluster from 1 node to 10 nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","Color Histogram; Hadoop; Key Frame Extraction; MapReduce","Big data; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Extraction; Graphic methods; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Optimization; Security systems; Color histogram; Computer vision algorithms; Hadoop; High-dimensional images; Key-frame extraction; Map-reduce; Map-reduce programming; Video indexing and retrieval; Image processing","Deshmane, P.; B.V.B CETIndia; email: deshmane.praveen@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

Many developing countries follow the manual method for diagnosing TB, which causes false alarms in the detection of TB positive or negative. In order to reduce the intervention of human we have developed an effective algorithm for the detection of tuberculosis bacilli as an automated system. This paper proposes a color segmentation and classification approach for automatic detection of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, which causes TB from the image of Ziehl-Nielsen stained sputum smear obtained from a bright microscope. Segment the bacilli called candidate bacilli using its characteristics from the image using Particle Swarm Optimization technique, depending on pixel intensities, each bacillus is segmented by extracting blue component of pixel values. The candidate bacilli are then grouped together using connected component analysis after using morphological operations. Detection of Tuberculosis bacilli from sputum smear by random forest technique is a prominent method used in diagnosing the tuberculosis by classifying the subject samples. The combination of particle swarm optimization and random forest classification provides better results and correct diagnosis in term of infection level.

Here the smart visual surveillance system starts with separating, detecting, and tracking of moving objects in the level crossing (Danger area) region using the proposed variance-based method. This new method is based on five frame background subtraction, five frame differencing and variance calculation for object detection and tracking. In the variance based method, the variance of rows and columns in video frames are calculated where the variation in image intensity pixels gives the position of moving object and it is used for locating and tracking the objects in the video. The algorithm is tested on various hazardous conditions over the level crossings such as vehicle crossing over the region of interest, pedestrian crossing the ROI, and stopped vehicle over the ROI. On the basis of comparison between proposed variance based algorithm and mean shift method, variance based method is more robust to environmental noise and accurately detecting an object in danger area with minimum computational timings. © 2017 IEEE.","Danger area; five frame background subtraction; five frame differencing; Level crossing; multiple object tracking; variance method","Image segmentation; Monitoring; Object recognition; Railroad accidents; Railroad crossings; Railroads; Roads and streets; Security systems; Smart city; Transportation; Background subtraction; Danger area; Frame differencing; Level crossing; Multiple object tracking; Variance method; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062553,,,"English","TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

This technique has been developed specifically for hand geometry based authentication, and thus requires that the hand is facing the camera with the fingers spread, as required by most of the hand geometry based techniques. For skin detection, we determined HSV and RGB color ranges and further modified those values by incorporating color information from face. We used a two-step shape filtering: the first one using shape characteristics such as solidity, eccentricity, while the second one is a novel method based on the distribution of skin pixels for the hand. The algorithm also determines the location of the wrist and segments the hand above the wrist.

Here, a novel concept is introduced regarding antipodal vivaldi antenna. In the ground plane of the antenna, square ring resonator (SRR) structure slot and circular ring resonator (CRR) structure slot are cut to produce the notch characteristic on the WLAN band. The designed antenna covers a bandwidth of 6.8 GHz (2.7 GHz-9.5 GHz) and it can be useful for a large range of wireless applications like satellite communication applications and biomedical applications where directional radiation characteristic is needed. The designed antenna shows better impedance matching in the above said band. A parametric study is also performed on the antenna design to optimize the performance of the antenna. The size of the antenna is 40×44×1.57 mm3. It is designed and simulated using HFSS. The presented prototype offers well directive radiation characteristics, good gain and efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.","Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) Ultra-wideband (UWB); circular ring resonator (CRR); Directional radiation pattern; Front to back (F/B) ratio; Notch Characteristics; square ring resonator (SRR)","Antenna grounds; Directive antennas; Medical applications; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Optical resonators; Resonators; Ring gages; Satellite communication systems; Slot antennas; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Antipodal Vivaldi antenna; Circular ring resonator; Directional radiation; Front to back (F/B) ratio; Notch Characteristics; Square ring resonator; Directional patterns (antenna)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

Simplicity of use, reliability and uniqueness are important characteristics of biometric based authentications. This kind of techniques can solve the typical problem of systems based on use of password which can be forgotten or stolen. Biometric systems plays a significant role in personal, national, and global security. Despite the increase in usage of biometric based systems, these are quiet susceptible to sophisticated spoofing attacks. Various spoofing attacks are present to defeat such biometric authentication systems. To improve the level of security, it is necessary to augment the reliable liveness detection tools as software modules along with the existing authentication systems. This paper targets the countermeasures for the biometric spoofing attacks and also suggests technical measures for implementing the biometric liveness detection systems. The research in this field is very active, with local descriptors.

All the methods of image inpainting start with a selection of the area which is needed to be inpainted. However, this selection of area or mask is to be done manually as there is no way for a machine to identify it. The process of creation of mask is cumbersome and time consuming and requires human expertise. Using image segmentation, the image can be divided into probable areas of inpainting and then the user can select area/s to generate the mask accurately and easily. In this paper we present a method to do selection of segments to generate mask which is further used to inpaint the image using exemplar based inpainting algorithm. The proposed scheme greatly reduces the overall inpainting time by drastically reducing the manual work of drawing the mask. Comparative results of masking object manually and by using proposed method are shown. Subjective analysis of inpainting using proposed method of masking and manual masking shows the effectiveness of the same. © 2017 IEEE.","Exemplar based Image inpainting; JSEG; Segmentation","Image segmentation; Area of interest; Exemplar-based; Human expertise; Image Inpainting; Inpainting; JSEG; Semi-automatics; Subjective analysis; Image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

Cooperative communication which is an enabling technology for the 5G has lead to further requirement of Quadrature Spatial Modulation (QSM). It will give better diversity leading to reduction in error rate. QSM is a recent digital MIMO transmission technique that improves the spectral efficiency and enhances the reliability of communication. In QSM system, Inter Channel Interference (ICI) is also avoided entirely since the two transmitted data are orthogonal and modulated on the real and imaginary parts of the carrier signals. The objective of the work is to implement the recent QSM in a cooperative system. A cooperative multiple Amplify and Forward (AF) relaying system over QSM technique is proposed.

In this manuscript a FSM based architecture is developed for the efficient implementation of K-means algorithm.

Such multi-standard wireless communication receivers (MWCRs) need filter bank to extract the desired signal of interest from wideband input spectrum and bring it to the baseband for further signal processing tasks such as spectrum sensing, modulation classification, demodulation etc. In MWCRs, rather any wireless receivers, modulated filter banks, such as Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks (DFTFB), are preferred due to their advantages such as lower area, delay and power requirements. To support multi-standard operation, reconfigurable DFTFB (RDFTFB) was proposed by integrating DFTFB with the coefficient decimation method. In this paper, an efficient high speed implementation of RDFTFB on Virtex-7 field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) has been proposed. The proposed approach minimizes the critical path delay between clocked registers thereby leading to significant improvement in the maximum operating frequency of the RDFTFB. Numerically, the proposed implementation leads to 89.7% improvement in the maximum frequency at which RDFTFB can be clocked.

Multiple input multiple output-Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) is extensively used in current and next generation broadband wireless communications to yield a high data rate of transmission and spectral efficiency over the multipath fading channels. The MIMO-OFDM systems has a major drawback as is it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which in turn requires designing of efficient power amplifier (PA), in order to maintain a wider linear region for preventing signal clipping, which therefore increases hardware complexity and power consumption. The various PAPR reduction algorithms have been developed which provide a maximum PAPR reduction ranging from 0.5 to 6 dB. The maximum SNR loss after applying a Beamforming technique is reported around 0.2 dB with BER of around 10-4 to 10-6. In the current work.

With the wireless interfaces, these will communicate with one another just in case of cooperative communication in a very single or multiple networks. As multiple nodes are required for cooperative communication, the stable election protocol (SEP) is used for cluster formation. Further Vector Quantization (VQ) is used for analysis of low energy path for the nodes and clusters respectively. The main issue of inter cluster node communication is carried out in earlier work using SEP protocol. The proposed technique illustrates the SEP-Vector Quantization (SEP-V) protocol, for intra-cluster communication in a cooperative communication network. In the application point of view, SEP-V performs the lowest energy path. SEP-V provides the intra-cluster communication between the cluster head, which creates the shortest path results in energy efficient technique.

Scanning through a wide band spectrum, particularly in the GHz range, poses challenges, especially for the Analog-To-Digital Converters that belongs to the front end of the CR receivers. Compressive Sensing is a method which addresses this problem, by collecting fewer samples compared to the ideal Nyquist rate. This paper proposes to use modified reconstruction algorithms based on orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for the recovery of the wide band Primary User (PU) signals from a very low number of collected samples. Here three algorithms are discussed viz. Stage wise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP), Regularized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (ROMP) and CoSaMP Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP). Simulation studies reveal that these three algorithms are better compared to the original OMP algorithm. Also, a study on the mean square performance is also done which reveals that CoSaMP outperforms other peer level algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.","Compressed Sensing; Orthogonal Matching Pursuit; Reconstruction; Wide Band","Analog to digital conversion; Compressed sensing; Image reconstruction; Internet of things; Radio systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Analog to digital converters; Matching pursuit algorithms; Mean-square performance; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Reconstruction algorithms; Regularized orthogonal matching pursuits; Wide-band; Wireless communications; Cognitive radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032433,,,"English","Proc.

Assessment and management of such wound is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Currently, precise wound bed estimation depends on the clinical judgment and remains a difficult task. The paper introduces a novel method for ulcer boundary demarcation and estimation, using optical images captured by a hand-held digital camera. The proposed approach involves gray based fuzzy similarity measure using spatial knowledge of an image. The fuzzy measure is used to construct similarity matrix. The best color channel was chosen by calculating the mean contrast for 26 different color channels of 14 color spaces. It was found that Db color channel has highest mean contrast which provide best segmentation result in comparison with other color channels. The fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) method was applied on Db color channel for effective delineation of wound region. The segmented wound regions were effectively post-processed using various morphological operations. The performance of proposed segmentation technique was validated by ground-truth images labeled by two experienced dermatologists and a surgeon. The FSC approach was tested on 70 images. FSC effectively segmented targeted ulcer boundary yielding 91.5% segmentation accuracy, 86.7%, Dice index and 79.0%. Jaccard score. The sensitivity and specificity was found to be 87.3% and 95.7% respectively. The performance evaluation shows the robustness of the proposed method of wound area segmentation and its potential to be used for designing patient comfort centric wound care system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chronic wound; Color constancy; Digital image processing; Fuzzy similarity measure; Segmentation; Spectral clustering","Clustering algorithms; Color; Dermatology; Diseases; Fuzzy logic; Geometrical optics; Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Optical data processing; Physiological models; Chronic wounds; Color constancy; Fuzzy similarity measure; Morphological operations; Performance evaluations; Segmentation techniques; Sensitivity and specificity; Spectral clustering; Image segmentation; adult; aged; Article; chronic wound; clinical evaluation; color; contrast; controlled study; decision making; evaluation study; female; fuzzy system; health care system; human; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; major clinical study; male; noise reduction; patient comfort; priority journal; ulcer; wound care; clinical trial; decubitus; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; image processing; injury; multicenter study; procedures; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Pressure Ulcer; Wounds and Injuries","Chakraborty, C.; School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: chandanc@smst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28479109","English","Comput.

This tool is mainly used to find early signs of breast cancer. Usually, mammogram image contains region with low contrast and complicated structured background. This may cause difficulties in detection of infected cells in their early stage. Using contrast enhancement of mammogram image we can increase the detection rate of early breast cancer. In this paper we propose a tool supported method named histogram modified grey relational analysis, based on HE with local contrast enhancement for mammogram images. This method enhances local as well as global contrast of given mammogram image and segments breast region in order to obtain better visual interpretation, analysis, and classification of mammogram masses to assist radiologists in making more accurate decisions. The main contribution of this work is to show that better breast-region segmentation results can be achieved from simple breast-region segmentation method if the input image has sufficient contrast with good interpretation of local details. We tested proposed method for MIAS mammogram images.

A novel PLL is designed using a linear PFD which is free of glitches, dead zone and blind zone, a charge pump based on current splitting technique and a modified current starved differential delay cell (MCSDD) VCO. Performance characteristics of proposed PLL obtained from circuit simulation in Cadence have been compared with simulation results from MATLAB. φ–V characteristics of linear PFD has been found to offer better linearity from −π to π as blind zone and dead zone are eliminated. Glitches at output of PFD have also been eliminated. Charge pump based on current splitting technique in combination with proposed PFD has been found to be effective in reducing leakage current to 3 nA. Tuning range of 98.12% with maximum operating frequency of 4.27 GHz has been obtained for the MCSDD VCO. PLL built with above circuits has been found to offer reference spur of −75.92 dBc@20 MHz offset, phase noise of −113.5 dBc/Hz@100 kHz and lock time of 2.95 μs.

The popular transforms such as discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) provide decent EC; however, their capability is not enough to deliver good quality image reconstruction for higher compression levels (CLs). In this study, the authors propose a new hybrid transform which is a fusion of wavelet packet transform (WPT) and block-DCT (BDCT) transform to achieve high-quality image compression. This new hybrid WPT-BDCT transform is able to attain higher EC than the existing transforms.

The proposed hybrid transform has been extensively evaluated, based on proposed ECI parameter, the visual quality assessment of reconstructed images and with the standard image quality indexes peak-signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure.

Though there are several research studies exclusively pertaining to drilling mechanism and the implications on materials, there are research voids that pertain to the driller’s hand-arm posture and the corresponding mechanical responses during the process. Considering the vitality of the ergonomics involved, the objective is framed to estimate the stresses acting on the hand while operating handheld drilling machine by different subjects and investigate the effects of various hand-arm postures on the stresses transmitted to the hands. Finger TPS—wireless tactile force sensor device—is employed for measuring the force exerted at the fingers while operating handheld cordless drilling machine. The nature of vibration transmitted to the human hand-arm system is affected by the contact force variation between a vibrating tool handle and the hand. The transmitted vibration will impose the stresses on the anatomical structure of the hand-arm system. In the present study, the dynamic response of a human hand to exert force during drilling task is analysed by three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of the human hand of a normal male. The model is developed from 3D reconstruction of CT scan images using the segmentation software, Mimics. The FE model contains the essential anatomical structures of a human hand. It includes both linear and nonlinear elements to represent rigid and elastic parts of the hand like the bones, tissues etc. Refined FE model is properly meshed, and analysis is carried out using finite element code ABAQUS. Preliminary results of the numerical analysis utilizing the developed model and qualitative evaluation are presented.

Caliber Fuzzy C-means (CFCM) clustering Algorithm for edge detection depends on the selection of initial cluster center value. This endeavor to put in order a collection of pixels into a cluster, such that a pixel within the cluster must be more comparable to every other pixel. Using CFCM techniques first cluster the BSDS image, next the clustered image is given as an input to the basic canny edge detection algorithm. The application of new parameters with fewer operations for CFCM is fruitful. According to the calculation, a result acquired by using CFCM clustering function divides the image into four clusters in common. The proposed method is evidently robust into the modification of fuzzy c-means and canny algorithm. The convergence of this algorithm is very speedy compare to the entire edge detection algorithms. The consequences of this proposed algorithm make enhanced edge detection and better result than any other traditional image edge detection techniques. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Besides strengthening the data authentication, integrity, non-repudiation properties, the computational overhead is also reduced in extracting the required keys without any uncertainty. Moreover, effort has been extended to sustain proper signal quality and restrict unauthorized tampering during wireless communication. The first phase of the algorithm describes collection of a digitized signature from a legitimate source; conversion of the pixels of the digitized signature into white or black form based on a threshold comparison result; formation of two shares by representing a pixel value as a combination of two pairs; conversion of the digital cover signal to two distinct frequency levels and casting of one of the shares in high frequency coefficients of the two distinct levels concurrently. The second phase explains appropriate detection of the fabricated share and a user and the proprietary document are authenticated by superimposing the detected share on the second share. The selection of a suitable threshold value to clean the digitized signature and control the share casting intensity helps in considerable reduction of the undesired white noise. The robustness of DWT in narrowband interferences in wireless communication supports its use in the proposed approach. The pseudorandom fabrication position supports visual secret sharing to safeguard the communicating parties from any suspicion.

The automated delineation of lesion is a prerequisite prior to characterization, which is challenging itself. Thus, this paper has two major objectives: (a) design of a segmentation system which can model by learning the lesion characteristics and this is posed as a Bayesian model; (b) develop a psoriasis risk assessment system (pRAS) by crisscrossing the blocks which drives the fundamental machine learning paradigm. Methods The segmentation system uses the knowledge derived by the experts along with the features reflected by the lesions to build a Bayesian framework that helps to classify each pixel of the image into lesion vs. background. Since this lesion has several stages and grades, hence the system undergoes the risk assessment to classify into five levels of severity: healthy, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. We build nine kinds of pRAS utilizing different combinations of the key blocks. These nine pRAS systems use three classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN)) and three feature selection techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and Mutual Information (MI)). The two major experiments conducted using these nine systems were: (i) selection of best system combination based on classification accuracy and (ii) understanding the reliability of the system. This leads us to computation of key system performance parameters such as: feature retaining power, aggregated feature effect and reliability index besides conventional attributes like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. Results Using the database used in this study consisted of 670 psoriasis images, the combination of SVM and FDR was revealed as the optimal pRAS system and yielded a classification accuracy of 99.84% using cross-validation protocol. Further, SVM-FDR system provides the reliability of 99.99% using cross-validation protocol. Conclusions The study demonstrates a fully novel model of segmentation embedded with risk assessment. Among all nine systems, SVM-FDR produced best results. Further, we validated our pRAS system with automatic segmented lesions against manually segmented lesions showing comparable performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian segmentation; Color features; Machine learning; Performance evaluation; Psoriasis; Texture features","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Dermatology; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Reliability; Support vector machines; Bayesian segmentation; Color features; Performance evaluation; Psoriasis; Texture features; Risk assessment; Article; Bayes theorem; benchmarking; classifier; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity assessment; Fsher Discriminant Ratio; image segmentation; machine learning; Mutual Information; nerve cell network; principal component analysis; psoriasis; risk assessment; support vector machine; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; discriminant analysis; human; pathology; psoriasis; reproducibility; risk assessment; Bayes Theorem; Decision Trees; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Principal Component Analysis; Psoriasis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Support Vector Machine","Suri, J.S.; Skin Point-of-Care Division, Global Biomedical Technologies, Inc.United States; email: jsuri@comcast.net",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28859832","English","Comput.

To achieve the goals of MEC, Mobile Edge (ME) servers are co-placed with the mobile network base station (at the edge of the mobile network). This eliminates the need to move computation and storage intensive tasks from a mobile device to a centralized cloud server. This in turn reduces the network communication load and delay and it also enhances the quality of service provided for the mobile end users. Applications, such as smart grid applications, content delivery networks, crowed sourcing, traffic management and E-health, will greatly benefit from such deployment. Unfortunately, a large-scale deployment of ME servers that is needed to make hundreds of applications available to millions of users, comes with great management complexity. The emerging technique of Software-Defined Systems (SDSys) abstracts the management complexities of many systems at different layers by utilizing software components. In this paper, we build a software-defined based framework that enable efficient and ubiquitous MCC services by integrating different SDSys components with the MEC system. The integrated framework is implemented and it is evaluated for its feasibility, flexibility and potential superiority. © The British Computer Society 2017.

The secondary network selection aims to minimize the outage probability of the primary satellite system and, thereby, to explore spectrum sharing opportunities. With the overlay approach, the selected secondary network allocates part of its power to relay the satellite signal and utilizes the remaining power to transmit its own signal. Considering Shadowed-Rician fading for satellite links, and Nakagami-m as well as Rician fading for terrestrial links, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability of both primary and secondary networks, and examine their achievable diversity orders.

The flat IP-based LTE and LTE-Advanced technologies are the expected key drivers for 5G. However, LTE, with its elapsed security mechanism and open nature, leaves a huge loophole for intruders to jeopardize the entire communication network. The time-And bandwidth-consuming authentication procedure in LTE leads to service disruptions and makes it unfit for public safety applications. To cater the prevailing LTE security and service requirements, we propose the 4G plus relative authentication model (4G+RAM), which is composed of two dependent protocols: 1) Privacy-protected evolved packet system authentication and key agreement protocol for the initial authentication (PEPS-AKA) and 2) 4G plus frequency-based re-Authentication protocol for the re-Authentication of known and frequent users (4G+FRP). The 4G+RAM supports seamless communication with a minimum signaling load on core elements and conceals users' permanent identifiers to ensure user privacy. We simulate the proposed protocols for formal security verification with the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool.

Whilst free space is undoubtedly a known medium for wireless energy harvesting, space waves are too attenuated to support realistic transmission of wireless energy. A layer of thin stratified dielectric material suspended in mid-Air can form a substantially less attenuated pathway, which efficiently supports propagation of wireless energy in the form of lateral waves. The conductivity of the suspended dielectric layer does not appear to be a critical factor rendering propagation of lateral waves impossible. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed to simulate wireless energy harvesting over a suspended layer of stratified dielectric material. The model has been experimentally verified with the help of a novel open-ended voltage multiplier designed to harvest energy from ambient electromagnetic fields. © 2013 IEEE.","Avremenko diode configurations; Energy harvesting; Goubau line; ground waves; lateral waves; stratified ground; TEM modes; TM modes; transverse magnetic modes; trapped surface waves; Zenneck Waves","Electromagnetic fields; Energy harvesting; Surface waters; Surface waves; Wireless telecommunication systems; Avremenko diode configurations; Goubau line; Ground waves; Lateral waves; Sea surfaces; stratified ground; Surface impedances; TEM modes; TM modes; Transverse magnetic modes; Trapped surface waves; Wireless communications; Zenneck waves; Dielectric materials","Zhang, Q.; Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Southern University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: zhangqf@sustc.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030786032

This paper presents a completely unique emotional modeling methodology for incorporating human feeling into intelligent systems. The projected approach includes a technique to elicit emotion factors from users, a replacement illustration of emotions and a framework for predicting and pursuit user’s emotional mechanical phenomenon over time. The neural network based CML service has better training concert and enlarged exactness compare to other large scale deep learning systems. Opinions are important to almost all human activities and cloud based sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment related information from text. With the rising popularity and availability of opinion rich resources such as personal blogs and online appraisal sites, new opportunities and issues arise as people now, actively use information technologies to explore and capture others opinions. In the existing system, a segmentation ranking model is designed to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification. A classification model is used for predicting the sentiment polarity of segmentation. The joint framework is trained directly using the sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without the use of any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. However the existing system still has issue with classification accuracy results. To improve the classification performance, in the proposed system, cloud integrate the support vector machine, naive bayes and neural network algorithms along with joint segmentation approaches has been proposed to classify the very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative features more effectively using important feature selection. Also to handle the outliers we apply modified k-means clustering method on the given dataset. It is used to cloud cluster the outliers and hence the label as well as unlabeled features is handled efficiently. From the experimental result, we conclude that the proposed system yields better performance than the existing system. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Classification; Cloud clustering; Cloud machine learning; Segmentation; Sentiment analysis","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Statistics; Classification accuracy; Classification models; Classification performance; Machine learning techniques; Modified k-means clustering; Neural network algorithm; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Learning systems","Arulmurugan, R.; Department of Information Technology, Bannari Amman Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: arulmr@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030089501

This paper gives a detailed explanation on the design and development of a wireless mesh network for large area monitoring. In our experiment, we were able to stream video through multiple hops to cover an area of approximately 1 square km. However, it was found that the quality of video decreases with increase in the number of hops because of the interference and decrease in the signal strength. The throughput and the latency also gradually decreases with increase in the number of hops. However, the latency achieved at the fourth hop is far better than the normal latency in an internet broadband network. © 2016 IEEE.","BATMAN-adv; mesh protocol; surviellance; Wireless Mesh Network","Broadband networks; Computer circuits; Mesh generation; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Wireless telecommunication systems; BATMAN-adv; Design and Development; Mesh protocols; Quality of videos; Signal strengths; surviellance; Use of wireless technology; Wireless mesh test bed; MESH networking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053698,,,"English","Int.

Therefore, an efficient optimization algorithm that converges at faster rate while minimizing the cost function (total power) is required. In this paper, we propose the use of Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to achieve assured coverage and connectivity control in backbone-based wireless networks. The Levenberg-Marquardt method combines the advantages of Cauchy steepest descent method and Newton-Raphson method and is expected to achieve faster convergence rate irrespective of initial conditions, which is the main motivation of this study. It relies on that when current solution is far from the optimal solution, then steepest descent method will be used, and as current solution approaches to optimal solution, then gradually switched to Newton-Raphson method to find the optimal solution. Extensive simulations using MATLABR2020a has been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method by measuring its performance in the number of iterations, elapsed time, and power requirement to maintain proper coverage and connectivity. The performance is compared with Cauchy steepest descent method as well as Newton-Raphson method.

Image processing based counterfeit IC design techniques are promising, but currently often suffer from high computational complexity and requirement of expensive image acquisition infrastructure. We describe two techniques based on image texture analysis to automate the process of counterfeit IC detection. The first method employs local textural feature identification to detect counterfeit ICs. The second method includes identification of counterfeit ICs by segmenting the image into regions of different textural features using texture filters. The first method is of lower computational complexity compared to the segmentation method, but the second method is capable of blind identification in the sense that it does not require knowledge of the textural features of a golden IC sample.

But ultrasonic can be a promising alternative method as unlike RF it does not have any biological effect that results in heating of human tissue. The development of aeronautical single channel and multichannel ultrasonic data communication system is discussed in this paper. Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) followed by Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is implemented successfully. Single channel of bandwidth 1 KHz were used allowing 8 bits of data packet transferred from the transmitter to the receiver concurrently. The rate of data transfer achieved was up to 1 kb/s. A model was designed during the work which could anticipate ultrasonic signals. The carrier frequency of data transmission was 40 KHz. The BitError Rate(BER) of the system was analyzed for different distances. The maximum distance of communication was 1 meter. Through the model designed we have transmitted image data, audio data and text data and received successfully. Further the source point was replaced with multipoint for application of Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) and show that multipoint point communication is possible with a rate of 327 b/s. The conclusion drawn was the oblique angles of less than 7°and error-free transmission could still be achieved. © 2017 IEEE.","Aeronautical ultrasound; amplitude shift keying(ASK); bit error rate(BER); multipoint to point; pulse width modulation(PWM); wireless sensor network(WSN)","Amplitude shift keying; Bit error rate; Convolutional codes; Data transfer; Fading channels; Modulation; Optical communication; Pulse width modulation; Signal processing; Voltage control; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Amplitude shift keying (ASK); Biological effects; Data-communication; Error free transmission; multipoint to point; Point communication; Ultrasonic signals; Wireless technologies; Data communication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

MIMO provides robustness against multipath fading using spatial diversity gain, and increases data rate by spatial multiplexing gain. These gains are achieved due to the usage of several antennas. This paper presents multiuser (MU) MIMO downlink system under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and heterogeneous user signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) profile. MU MIMO essentially provides multiuser diversity gain. System capacity is increased by choosing the users experiencing better channel parameters. We have used normalized SNR based scheduler to select a user for data transmission. The outcomes of these techniques are higher data rate and transmitting long range without need of much power or bandwidth. Alamouti's space time block code (STBC) has been used in this work to increase the transmit diversity, which improves reliability of data transfer. In this paper a comparative performance evaluation of MU MIMO-STBC and MIMO-OFDM has been presented.

The proposed constraint sets–based method is flexible and optimum for the UWB mask. The pulse designed by the proposed method is Federal Communication Commission compliant and has an autocorrelation function similar to the Gaussian pulse. The bit error rate performance of time hopping binary phase shift keying using the proposed method and some of the existing methods such as Norman and Lee pulses and sixth derivative Gaussian pulse is analyzed in additive white Gaussian noise and Saleh-Valenzuela channels. Pulse designed using the proposed method outperforms existing pulse design, and the same is verified through simulations. The proposed algorithm is flexible and can also be used to mitigate narrow band interference, multiband UWB pulse generation and any other Federal Communication Commission (or other regulatory body) compliant spectrum mask by modifying the parameter of the proposed constraint set(s).

The base station (BS) transmits the coded symbols to the relays during the first time interval. The relay decodes the symbol and then re-encodes the information so that error free communication can be achieved. Then, the coded bit stream is transmitted during the second time interval. Finally, we will obtain the user’s information at the destination using iterative decoding algorithm and achieve better ER with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We assume that each user is reinforced by at least single relay. We consider MC modulation which convert frequency-selective channel into flat-fading channel. We realize TP technique on both the BS and the intermediate relays, so that the effects of Multi-user interference and Inter-relay-interference are suppressed. To be specific, we evaluate ER performance of MC-IDMA system using TP for co-operative network with rich scattering effects based on LTE-vehicular channel environments considering both BS to relay and relay to mobile stations (MS).

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel and efficient self-optimizing HO detection along with HO execution and decision parameter optimization algorithm which is named as Handover Detection Self-Organizing-HO Parameters (HD-SOHP) based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) concept. HD-SOHP improves the users’ mobility performance by achieving effective session handovers thereby reducing call drop, HO failures and ping-pong at the cell level. Compared with the different SON based handover techniques as stated in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4, HD-SOHP gives two times performance improvement with respect to call drop, handover failure and ping-pong for the users’ moving with speed up to 120kmph. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Handover; LTE-A; MDP; Reinforcement learning; SON","4G mobile communication systems; Arts computing; Drops; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Reinforcement learning; Standards; 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP); Handover; Handover performance optimizations; LTE-A; Lte-advanced (LTE-A); Self Organizing Network (SON); Self-organizing method; Wireless cellular networks; Wireless telecommunication systems","Chaudhuri, S.; IIIT-Bangalore, Electronic CityIndia; email: saptarshi.chaudhuri@iiitb.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",01403664,,COCOD,,"English","Comput Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027864328

Stochastic gradient (SG)-based non-parametric maximum likelihood (NPML) estimator, gives better channel estimates in the presence of Gaussian mixture (AWGN plus interference) noise processes, for subsequent use by the channel equalizer. However, for sparse channels, the SG-NPML-based channel estimator requires large iterations to converge. In this paper, we propose a natural gradient (NG)-based channel estimator for sparse channel estimation in the presence of high interference. We propose a generalized p th order warping transformation on channel coefficients space and then calculate the Riemannian metric tensor, thereby resulting in faster convergence in interference limited channels. The proposed algorithm is applied for IEEE 802.22 (based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) channel estimation in the presence of interference. Extensive simulations and experimental results show that the proposed NG-based algorithm converges faster than SG-NPML for the same mean squared error (MSE) floor with similar computational complexity per iteration as an SG-NPML algorithm. We also present convergence analysis of proposed NG-NPML algorithm in the presence of Gaussian mixture noise and derive an analytical expression for the steady-state MSE. © 2013 IEEE.","convergence analysis; Gaussian mixture noise; IEEE 802.22; natural gradient; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing non-parametric maximum likelihood; Riemannian geometry; sparse channel estimation","Frequency estimation; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Geometry; Iterative methods; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Mean square error; Measurements; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Stochastic systems; Wave interference; White noise; Wireless telecommunication systems; Algorithm design and analysis; Convergence; Convergence analysis; Gaussian mixture noise; IEEE 802.22; Matching pursuit algorithms; Natural gradient; Non-parametric; Riemannian geometry; Sparse channel estimations; Channel estimation","Bishnu, A.; Signal and Software Group, Discipline of Electrical Engineering, IIT IndoreIndia; email: phd1501102014@iiti.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030642730

With the popularity of the Internet of Things in recent years, source privacy protection has attracted a lot of attentions. In order to mitigate this threat, many proposals show their merits. However, they fail to get the tradeoff between multi-path transmission and transmission cost. In this paper, we propose a constrained random routing mechanism, which can constantly change routing next-hop instead of a relative fixed route so that attackers cannot analyze routing and trace back to source nodes. First, we design a specific selection domain which is located around the sending node according to the dangerous distance and the wireless communication range. Then sending nodes calculate the selected weights of the candidate nodes according to their offset angles in this domain. Finally, the selected weights help to decide which node will become the next hop. In this way, attackers would be confused by the constantly changing paths. The simulation results prove that our proposal can achieve high routing efficiency in multi-path transmission, while only introducing a controllable energy consumption, end-to-end delay and redundant paths. © 2013 IEEE.","offset angle; probability; source privacy protection; Wireless sensor networks","Energy utilization; Probability; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Internet of thing (IoTs); Multi-path transmission; Offset angle; Routing efficiency; Source privacies; Transmission costs; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Hu, G.; Shenzhen Institute of Information TechnologyChina; email: hugw@sziit.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030321687

The threshold-selection decode-and-forward relay is considered, which can decode the source message correctly only if a predefined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved. The effects of channel state information (CSI) availability on secrecy outage probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived. Diversity is achieved from the direct and relaying paths both at the destination and at the eavesdropper by combinations of maximal-ratio combining and selection combining schemes. An asymptotic analysis is provided when each hop SNR is the same in the balanced case and when it is different in the unbalanced case. The analysis shows that both hops can be a bottleneck for secure communication; however, they do not affect the secrecy identically. While it is observed that CSI knowledge can improve secrecy, the amount of improvement for SOP is more when the required rate is low and for ESR when the operating SNR is also low. It is also shown that the source to eavesdropper link SNR is more crucial for secure communication. © 2013 IEEE.","Channel state information; cooperative diversity; decode-and-forward relay; ergodic secrecy rate; secrecy outage probability; threshold-selection relay","Asymptotic analysis; Channel capacity; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Cooperative communication; Cryptography; Decoding; Diversity reception; Rayleigh fading; Secure communication; Transmitters; Wireless telecommunication systems; Co-operative diversity; Decode-and-forward relay; Ergodics; Relays; Secrecy outage probabilities; Threshold selection; Wireless communications; Signal to noise ratio","Duong, T.Q.; School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University BelfastUnited Kingdom; email: trung.q.duong@qub.ac.uk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030265662

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a great problem for a user of computers linked to the Internet. Data mining techniques are widely used in IDS to identify attacks using the network traffic. This paper presents and evaluates a Radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) detector to identify DDoS attacks. Many of the training algorithms for RBF-NNs start with a predetermined structure of the network that is selected either by means of a priori knowledge or depending on prior experience. The resultant network is frequently inadequate or needlessly intricate and a suitable network structure could be configured only by trial and error method.

From histology point of view, the presence of mucin is one of the indicators for detection of this carcinoma. In order to detect MC, the proposed method majorly includes pre-processing by colour correction, colour transformation followed by near-set based segmentation and post-processing for delineating only mucin regions from the histological images at 40×. The segmentation step works in two phases such as Learn and Run.In pre-processing step, white balance method is used for colour correction of microscopic images (RGB format). These images are transformed into HSI (Hue, Saturation, and Intensity) colour space and H-plane is extracted in order to get better visual separation of the different histological regions (background, mucin and tissue regions). Thereafter, histogram in H-plane is optimally partitioned to find set representation for each of the regions. In Learn phase, features of typical mucin pixel and unlabeled pixels are learnt in terms of coverage of observed sets in the sample space surrounding the pixel under consideration. On the other hand, in Run phase the unlabeled pixels are clustered as mucin and non-mucin based on its indiscernibilty with ideal mucin, i.e. their feature values differ within a tolerance limit. This experiment is performed for grade-I and grade-II of MC and hence percentage of average segmentation accuracy is achieved within confidence interval of [97.36 97.70] for extracting mucin areas.

The standards which use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) coupled with multi input multi output (MIMO) are expected to rule the future wireless world. Time selective nature of the channel introduces inter carrier interference (ICI), which is the major performance limiting parameter in OFDM based systems. ICI causes loss in spectral efficiency and results in poor bit error rate (BER) performance, affecting the QoS of MIMO-OFDM systems. The conventional single input single output (SISO)-OFDM-flexible subcarrier spacing (FSS) system offers better performance than the fixed subcarrier spacing systems in terms of ICI mitigation. But BER and spectral efficiency performance of SISO-OFDM-FSS is not good enough to satisfy the requirements of future wireless broadband services. To improve the BER performance, SISO-OFDM system is replaced by space frequency block coded (SFBC)-OFDM system, which adds spatial and frequency diversity benefits to the conventional system. More number of antennas in the MIMO scheme increases the hardware cost, computational complexity and percentage of overhead. In the present study, to improve the spectral efficiency and to reduce the complexity and cost, optimal transmit antenna selection (OTAS) is combined with the SFBC-OFDM-FSS scheme. The simulation results prove that the proposed SFBC-OFDM-FSS-OTAS scheme offers better QoS than the conventional SISO-OFDM-FSS scheme. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Flexible subcarrier spacing (FSS); Inter carrier interference (ICI); Optimal transmit antenna selection (OTAS); Quality of service (QoS); Signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR); Space frequency block codes (SFBC)","Antennas; Bit error rate; Block codes; Communication channels (information theory); Efficiency; Error statistics; Fading channels; Frequency division multiplexing; MIMO systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Spurious signal noise; Wireless telecommunication systems; Intercarrier interference; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Space frequency block code (SFBC); Sub-carrier spacings; Transmit antenna selection; Quality of service","Babu, K.V.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: vinothbab@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018796026

As a recent trend defence networks are incorporating off-the-shelf, state of the art commercial protocols to enhance the capability of their networks. LTE is one such commercially available protocol which is easy to deploy and provide high data rate which can be ideally implemented in WMN for defence networks. To enable these high data rate services LTE-based defence mesh networks (DMN) are the requirement of the day and future. However, LTE-based DMN are prone to congestion at times of active operations or full-fledged war. The congestion scenarios may lead to LTE packet loss. Hence, it is pertinent that these networks amalgamate information grooming algorithms to alleviate the throughput of the network in peak hour conditions. An efficient priority scheduling algorithm based on class of service prioritisation, data rate consumption and location of origin of traffic in the DMN is proposed. The simulations demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed priority scheduling algorithm, the overall packet loss of priority packets in the DMN reduces substantially. © 2017, DESIDOC.","Class of service; Data rate; Long term evolution; OFDM; Quality of service; WiMax; Wireless mesh networks","Internet protocols; Location based services; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mesh generation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Packet loss; Packet networks; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Wi-Fi; Wimax; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Centralised; Class of service; Data rates; Grooming algorithms; High data rate; Recent trends; Scheduling architecture; State of the art; MESH networking",,,"Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre",0011748X,,DSJOA,,"English","Def.

In this paper, performance of MIMO transmission schemes with joint channel allocation and relay assignment (JCARA) in MIMO cooperative cognitive radio network (CRN) is studied. The problem of maximizing the spectrum efficiency among multiple CR source–destination pairs under different number of antenna configurations is studied. In order to improve the spectrum efficiency, multiple antennas are exploited at cognitive radio (CR) sources, CR relays, and CR destinations in a cooperative CRN. In this concern, we obtain the spectrum efficiency for various settings of MIMO maximum ratio transmission (MIMO-MRT) and MIMO transmit antenna selection (MIMO-TAS) schemes, which are applied at CR transmitter (i.e., CR sourc/relay) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) is applied at CR receivers (i.e., CR relay/destination), with JCARA. Extensive numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the MIMO-MRT and MIMO-TAS schemes. It is also shown that as the number of transmit–receive antenna increases the spectrum efficiency of both the MIMO-MRT and MIMO-TAS schemes increases as compared to single transmit–receive antenna case. Moreover, it is shown that relay assignment offers more benefit of maximization of minimum transmission rate with the MIMO-TAS scheme than the MIMO-MRT scheme. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cognitive radio; Cooperative communication; Maximum ratio transmission; Multiple-input multiple-output; Resource allocation; Spectrum efficiency; Transmit antenna selection","Antennas; Codes (symbols); Cognitive radio; Communication channels (information theory); Cooperative communication; Efficiency; Feedback control; Radio communication; Radio transmission; Receiving antennas; Resource allocation; Telecommunication repeaters; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication reliabilities; Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks; Maximum ratio combining; Maximum ratio transmission; Multiple input multiple output techniques; Spectrum efficiency; Transmit antenna selection; Wireless communications; MIMO systems","Mishra, S.; Department of Information and Communication Technology, ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and ManagementIndia; email: sadhanamishra4678@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019212388

Such images need more security and confidentiality as total diagnosis depends on it. In telemedicine applications, transmission of medical image via open channel, demands strong security and copyright protection. In our proposed robust watermarking model, a double layer security is introduced to ensure the robustness of embedded data. The embedded data is scrambled using a unique key and then a transform domain based hybrid watermarking technique is used to embed the scrambled data into the transform coefficients of the host image. The data embedding in medical images involves more attention, so that the diagnosis part must not be affected by any modification. Therefore, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier, which classify a medical image into two regions i.e. Non Region of Interest (NROI) and Region of Interest (ROI) to embed watermark data into the NROI part of the medical image, using the proposed embedding algorithm.

This study proposes a system which can identify the gender based on face image. For finding the location of the face region, each input image is divided into overlapping blocks and Gabor features are extracted with different scale and orientations. Generate the enhanced feature, concatenate mean, standard deviation and skewness of Gabor features which are obtained from each block. For detecting face region, this feature is passed to ensemble classifier. To recognise the gender, reinforced local binary patterns are used to extract the facial local features. Adaboost algorithm is used to select and classify the discriminative features such as male or female. The authors' experimental results on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), FERET and Gallagher databases for face detection using Gabor features achieve 98, 98.5 and 96.5% accuracy, respectively. Moreover, the reinforced local binary patterns achieve the accuracy for gender classification as 97.08, 98.5 and 94.21% on the LFW, FERET and Gallagher databases, respectively.

The antenna resonates at 4.5 GHz when a half wavelength slot section is fed by the coplanar waveguide line. The fundamental resonant frequency is lowered by 2.05 GHz when the slot antenna is loaded with a pair of SRR at the end of the half wavelength slot section. The additional inductive and capacitive reactance of the resonator enables the patch to resonate at lower frequency (2.45 GHz). The proposed antenna structure reduces the resonant frequency with respect to the reference antenna (slot antenna without SRR) by 45.5%, causing the patch to almost reach an electrically small size. Finally, asymmetrical slot has been used and a wide band antenna of band width 900 MHz has been achieved. Despite the loaded patch touching the electrically small limit, the antenna needs no matching networks, offers high efficiency and exhibits a bandwidth better than the unperturbed patch. The radiation pattern is also seen to be unaffected by the presence of the SRR. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CPW-fed; Electrically small antenna and wideband antenna; Slot antenna; SRR","Antenna feeders; Bandwidth; Coplanar waveguides; Directional patterns (antenna); Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Natural frequencies; Optical resonators; Resonators; Ring gages; Spiral antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna structures; Capacitive reactance; Coplanar waveguide lines; CPW-fed; Fundamental resonant frequencies; Reference antennas; Wideband antenna; Wireless application; Slot antennas","Ghosh, C.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, B.

CDMA has contributed much to the field of wireless communication and still addresses many of the capacity and security requirements. The collaborative multi-user technique achieves an increase in capacity by sharing the spreading sequences among the users. In such grouped CDMA schemes, the sum of large numbers of statistically uncorrelated pseudo-random (PN) sequences results in multiple access interference. This restricts the number of PN sequences available for spreading, thereby limiting the total number of full rate users. Furthermore, PN sequences can be detected by their bit timings and consequently the security of the users’ data is a matter of concern. To solve this problem, a novel high-capacity and secure system, called the 1D-Bernoulli-chaotic-collaborative-CDMA (BCC-CDMA), is proposed. In the BCC-CDMA, a set of specific ‘initial-conditions’ are used, and identified for the 1D-Bernoulli Map, that generates row elements of an N × N matrix of mutually orthogonal chaotic sequences,. The ith row of this matrix acts as the spreading sequence for the ith group of collaborating users in BCC-CDMA. The proposed scheme eliminates the constraints in security and user capacity outperforming the existing multi-user detection schemes. Simulations show the bit-error-rate performance of BCC-CDMA supporting 120 full-rate users compared to the almost 90 and 30 users offered by conventional schemes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","BCC-CDMA; Chaotic sequences; Multi-user detection; Multiple access interference","Bit error rate; Matrix algebra; Mobile security; Multiple access interference; Multiuser detection; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Chaotic sequence; Code division multiple access (CDMA); Contemporary techniques; Conventional schemes; Security requirements; Spreading sequences; Wireless communications; Code division multiple access","Babu, S.B.S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, SRM UniversityIndia; email: sumithbabusb@yahoo.co.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019133431

Trajectory data are obtained using GPS devices that capture the position of an object at specific time intervals. These enormous amounts of data necessitates to explore efficient and effective techniques to extract useful information to solve real world problems. Traffic flow pattern mining is one of the challenging issues for many applications. In a literature significant number of approaches are available to cluster the trajectory data, however the clustering has not been explored for trajectories pattern mining in bi-directional road networks. This paper presents a novel technique for excavating heavy traffic flow patterns in bi-directional road network, i.e. identifying divisions of the roads where the traffic flow is very dense. The proposed technique works in two phases: phase I, finds the clusters of trajectory points based on density of trajectory points; phase II, arranges the clusters in sequence based on spatiotemporal values for each route and directions. These sequences represent the traffic flow patterns. All the routes and sections exceeding a user specified minimum traffic threshold are marked as high dense traffic areas. The experiments are performed on synthetic dataset. The proposed algorithm efficiently and accurately finds the dense traffic in bi-directional roads.

Deployment of Femto cells inside a building can lead to signal leakage at the edges/corners of the buildings. This causes cross-tier interference and degrades the performance of users in High Interference Zone (HIZone) around the building area, who are connected to one of the MBSs in LTE Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). Hybrid Access Femto cells (HAFs) can ensure QoS for paid Subscriber Group (SG) users by giving them preferential access to resource blocks over non-SG (NSG) users and also improve the throughput of LTE HetNet system by serving nearby NSG users. In this work, we address various challenges involved in deployment and operation of HAFs in indoor environments by proposing an Optimal Placement of Femto cell (OPF) model, a dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (BWA) mechanism for splitting resource blocks between SG and NSG users, a dynamic power control mechanism to mitigate co-tier and cross-tier interference in HetNets and an Enhanced Priority (EP) scheduling mechanism to give more priority to SG users over NSG users. During peak traffic load scenarios, HAFs may not be able to guarantee QoS of both indoor and HIZone users connected to them. As HAFs are primarily meant for indoor users, HAFs employ an Optimal Power Control (OPC) mechanism to tune their transmit powers so that HIZone users are offloaded to near-by MBSs. Since the OPC is a Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem, we put forth a Sub-Optimal Power Control (SOPC) mechanism. The SOPC mechanism boosts the throughput of MBSs by almost 62% over the traditional 3GPP proposed enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Co-ordination (eICIC) mechanism for 300 users in the HetNet system. Also, the proposed EP scheduling mechanism maintains Jain's fairness index of 0.99 for both SG and NSG users while providing a 40% higher per user throughput than that obtained with the legacy proportional fair and Priority Set schedulers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid access femtocells; Optimization; Power control and dynamic scheduling; Resource splitting","Cells; Dynamics; Femtocell; FORTH (programming language); Frequency allocation; Heterogeneous networks; Integer programming; Mobile telecommunication systems; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Scheduling; Signal interference; Spurious signal noise; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cross-tier interferences; Dynamic bandwidth allocation; Dynamic scheduling; Femto-cells; LTE heterogeneous networks; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Resource splitting; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Power control","Sathya, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology HyderabadIndia; email: cs11p1003@iith.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01403664,,COCOD,,"English","Comput Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021938531

The detection of small weld defects present on noisy image is extremely difficult in non-destructive testing through machine vision. The presence of high gradient magnitude and the low intensity in the feature space of a noisy image are the main characteristics of weld defects. These characteristics can be considered to refine and obtain noise-free images for detection of weld defects. This study proposes a modified anisotropic diffusion model, which considers a local probability value of gray-level and an adaptive threshold parameter in diffusion coefficient function to adjust the implication of low edge gradient of the feature space from the noisy image. Furthermore, an entropy based stopping criterion has been introduced to terminate the diffusion process. This proposed model is compared with the existing models, and its performance is evaluated through Mean Square Error (MSE), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy (E) and Mean Structural Similarity (MSSIM) measures.

These hybrid algorithms are sensitive to initial centroids, parameter tuning and dependency with the fuzzy membership function to define the IFS. In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm, namely generalized rough intutionistic fuzzy c-means (GRIFCM) is proposed for brain magnetic resonance (MR) image segmentation avoiding the dependency with the fuzzy membership function. In this algorithm, each pixel is categorized into three rough regions based on the thresholds obtained by the image data by minimizing the noise. These regions are used to create IFS. The distance measure based on IFS eliminate's the influence of noise and INU present in the image producing accurate brain tissue segmentation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation and compared it with existing k-means (KM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), Rough fuzzy c-means (RFCM), Generalized rough fuzzy c-means (GRFCM), soft rough fuzzy c-means (SRFCM) and rough intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (RIFCM) algorithms.

Automated Video Surveillance (AVS) systems are established to automatically monitor objects in real-time. Employing wireless communication in an AVS system is an attractive solution due to its convenient installation and configuration. Unfortunately, wireless communication, in general, has limited bandwidth, not to mention the intrinsic dynamic conditions of the network (e.g., collision and congestion). Many solutions have been proposed in the literature to solve the bandwidth allocation problem in wireless networks, but much less work is done to design evaluation frameworks for such solutions. This paper targets the demand for a realistic wireless AVS system simulation framework that models and simulates most of the details in a typical wireless AVS framework. The proposed simulation framework is built over the well-known NS-3 network simulator. This framework also supports the testing and the evaluation of cross-layer solutions that manages many factors over different layers of AVS systems in the wireless 802.11 infrastructure network. Moreover, the simulation framework supports the collection of many used performance metrics that are usually used in AVS system performance evaluation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Automated Video Surveillance; Bandwidth optimization; Online bandwidth estimation; Simulation framework; Video distortion","Automation; Bandwidth; Monitoring; Real time systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Automated video surveillance; Bandwidth estimation; Bandwidth optimization; Simulation framework; Video distortions; Security systems","Alsmirat, M.A.; Department of Computer Science, Jordan University of Science and TechnologyJordan; email: masmirat@just.edu.jo",,"Springer Verlag",18618200,,,,"English","J.

However, measurements of these minute changes are highly dependent on the accurate segmentation of bone tissue from MR images and it is challenging task due to the complex tissue structure and inadequate image contrast/brightness. In this paper, a fully automated method for segmenting subchondral bone from knee MR images is proposed. Here, the contrast of knee MR images is enhanced using a gray-level S-curve transformation followed by automatic seed point detection using a three-dimensional multi-edge overlapping technique. Successively, bone regions are initially extracted using distance-regularized level-set evolution followed by identification and correction of leakages along the bone boundary regions using a boundary displacement technique. The performance of the developed technique is evaluated against ground truths by measuring sensitivity, specificity, dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average surface distance (AvgD) and root mean square surface distance (RMSD). An average sensitivity (91.14%), specificity (99.12%) and DSC (90.28%) with 95% confidence interval (CI) in the range 89.74–92.54%, 98.93–99.31% and 88.68–91.88% respectively is achieved for the femur bone segmentation in 8 datasets. For tibia bone, average sensitivity (90.69%), specificity (99.65%) and DSC (91.35%) with 95% CI in the range 88.59–92.79%, 99.50–99.80% and 88.68–91.88% respectively is achieved. AvgD and RMSD values for femur are 1.43 ± 0.23 (mm) and 2.10 ± 0.35 (mm) respectively while for tibia, the values are 0.95 ± 0.28 (mm) and 1.30 ± 0.42 (mm) respectively that demonstrates acceptable error between proposed method and ground truths. In conclusion, results obtained in this work demonstrate substantially significant performance with consistency and robustness that led the proposed method to be applicable for large scale and longitudinal knee OA studies in clinical settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","3D multi-edge overlapping; Boundary correction; Boundary displacement; Gray-level S-curve transformation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Subchondral bone segmentation","Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Tissue; Bone segmentation; Boundary correction; Boundary displacements; Edge overlapping; S Curve; Bone; Article; automation; bone; confidence interval; contrast enhancement; controlled study; image segmentation; imaging software; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; subchondral bone; surface property; three dimensional imaging; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; human; knee; knee osteoarthritis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Algorithms; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Knee; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Osteoarthritis, Knee","Kumar, D.; Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research, Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PetronasMalaysia; email: dileep.utp@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28711767","English","Comput.

This kind of analysis is helpful to explore the potential reasons behind why players leave the game, analyse retention trends, design customised strategies for different player segments, and then boost the overall retention rate. In particular, a new similarity metric which is driven by players' stickiness to the game is developed to cluster players. Three feature dimensions, namely engagement features (e.g., log-in frequency and length of log-in time), performance features (e.g., level, the number of completed tasks, coins and achievements), and social interactions features (e.g., the number of in-game friends, whether or not to join a guild, and the guild role), are employed and aggregated to derive the stickiness metric. The applicability and utility of this new segmentation model are illustrated through experiments that are conducted on a realistic MMORPG dataset. The derived results are also discussed and compared against two benchmark models. The results reveal that the new segmentation model not only achieves better clustering performance, but also improves player's lifetime prediction by better distinguishing between loyal customers and churners. The empirical results confirm the effects of social interaction, which is usually underestimated in the current research, on player segmentation. From an operational perspective, the derived results would help game developers better understand the different retention-behaviour patterns of players, establish effective and customised tactics to retain more players, and boost product revenue. © 2017","Clustering analysis; Game data mining; Online social games; Retention management","Data mining; Image segmentation; Social sciences; Clustering analysis; Feature dimensions; Game data minings; Lifetime prediction; Player segmentation; Segmentation models; Social games; Social interactions; Social networking (online)","Chen, X.; School of Management, Zhejiang UniversityChina; email: chen_xi@zju.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",01679236,,DSSYD,,"English","Decis Support Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020419611

Over the period of time, researchers have proposed various multiplier designs in order to get high speed. Vedic multiplier is considered as one of the low power multiplier along with high speed as compared with traditional array and booth multipliers. Vedic Multiplier contains a total of sixteen algorithms/sutras for predominantly logical operations. This research focuses on thermal aspects and energy efficiency of wireless communications systems with the thermal aware low power design of Vedic Multiplier. Temperature plays an important role on the performance of any device. The primary purpose of this research is to enhance the thermal stability of the wireless communications. Energy efficient IO standards are used to decrease the power dissipation of Vedic Multiplier and that eventually decrease power dissipation of wireless communications systems. In order to study the effect of different process technology (40, 65, 90 nm) on our design, a novel design is implemented on 40, 65 and 90 nm based FPGA. In this work, we are integrating thermal aware design approach for energy efficient Vedic Multiplier on various FPGA using LVCMOS and HSTL I/O standard. LVCMOS is an acronym for Low Voltage Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor and HSTL is an acronym for High Speed Transceiver Logic. In this Vedic Multiplier, we are using three LVCMOS I/O standard and nine HSTL I/O standard. In order to test the thermal sustainability of our Vedic Multiplier design, we are testing it in three different room temperatures i.e. 20, 30, and 40 °C. Using LVCMOS25, there is 12.99, 19.23 and 10.28% reduction in power dissipation on 90, 65 and 40 nm FPGAs respectively. For LVCMOS25, when our Vedic Multiplier design is migrated from 40 nm design to 90 nm FPGA design, there is 87.72% reduction in power dissipation of Vedic Multiplier when temperature is kept constant at 20 °C. When temperature is scaled down from 50 to 20 °C there is 12.45, 14.93, 12.84, 9.45 and 8.48% saving in power dissipation on using HSTL_I, HSTL_I_12, HSTL_I_18, HSTL_I_DCI and HSTL_I_DCI_18 IO Standard respectively on 90 nm FPGA. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficient wireless communication; FPGA; Green communication; I/O standard; Thermal aware wireless communication; Vedic multiplier","CMOS integrated circuits; Electric losses; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Radio transceivers; Thermal management (electronics); Thermodynamic stability; Wireless telecommunication systems; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Green communications; High-speed transceivers; Low power multipliers; Thermal-aware design; Vedic multipliers; Wireless communications; Wireless communications system; Energy efficiency","Kumar, T.; Indus UniversityPakistan; email: tanesh.nust@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020120847

Video surveillance is an vital area, its applications including both indoor and outdoor automated surveillance systems. In the context of smart home environments, surveillance systems have as principal end to control the safety and the security of materials and of people living in a domestic environment. The automatic analysis and understanding of behaviour and interactions is a crucial job in the design of socially intelligent video surveillance system. The automatic detection addresses several human factor issues underlying the existing surveillance systems. This paper introduces a technique for motion detection and tracking that incorporates several innovative mechanisms. The algorithm presented here is applicable only for binary images and it have two-step procedure. Most challenging task in any facial classification technique is the representation of face in terms of a vector. This vector provides input to a trained classifier and classifier performs final classification. Input vector should represent facial characteristics in most efficient manner such that while it contains all possible information about face.

Index modulation schemes are attractive for their advantages such as good performance, high rates, and hardware simplicity. This paper focuses on index modulation schemes in which multiple transmission entities, namely, antennas, time slots, and RF mirrors, are indexed simultaneously. Recognizing that such multidimensional index modulation schemes encourage sparsity in their transmit signal vectors, we propose efficient signal detection schemes that use compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms. Results show that, for a given rate, improved performance is achieved when the number of indexed transmission entities is increased. We also explore indexing opportunities in load modulation, which is a modulation scheme that offers power efficiency and reduced RF hardware complexity advantages in multiantenna systems. Results show that indexing space and time in load modulated multiantenna systems can achieve improved performance. © 2017 IEEE.","compressive sensing; indexed load modulation; multidimensional hypersphere; Multidimensional index modulation; RF mirrors; signal detection; time slots; transmit antennas; transmit RF chains","Antennas; Compressed sensing; Hardware; Indexing (of information); Information theory; Mirrors; Radio transmission; Signal detection; Slot antennas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Compressive sensing; Hypersphere; Load modulation; Multidimensional index; Time slots; Transmit antenna; Modulation","Shamasundar, B.; Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052936,,,"English","Inf.

Though our concept is generic, we applied it for the challenging task of vessel segmentation in fundus images. We show that proposed method is more data efficient than a CNN. Specifically, with 150K, 30K and 15K training examples, proposed method achieves mean AUC of 0.962, 0.945 and 0.931 respectively, whereas the simple CNN achieves AUC of 0.960, 0.921 and 0.916 respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer vision; Discriminators; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Convolutional neural network; Microscopic image; Multitask learning; Retinal fundus images; Semantic segmentation; Vessel segmentation; Image segmentation",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21607508,9781538607336,,,"English","IEEE Comput.

The multicarrier communication have more spectral efficiency and less noise effect compare with single carrier communication. One of the major MCM technique is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The Main application of OFDM in wireless communication like WCDMA, LTE Digital Video broadcasting, Digital Audio Broadcasting, Wireless broadband communication and ADSL etc. The main disadvantage of OFDM technique is peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The PAPR reduction is one of the major problem in OFDM. To reduce PAPR there are various algorithms are available like SLM, Coding, and PTS etc. In PTS also different type of algorithms are available. The Adjacent portioning PTS is one of the advanced algorithm which is used for reducing PAPR. Adjacent portioning with Partial transmit sequence (AP-(PTS) aim to reduce the PAPR of OFDM signal. The PTS technique is one of the most promising technique to reduce PAPR. In this paper gives an idea to implement adjacent partition PTS with turbo coding for the better performance of the OFDM. Analysis of PAPR with PTS and without PTS is done and the reduction of PAPR is occurred by using this technique. Analysis of the PAPR reduction by using this technique with turbo coding is done by implementing AP-PTS with turbo coding in Simulink.

Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can indicate structural changes in the cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes micro-photographed under metaphase is done by characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread images. Currently, considerable effort and time is spent to manually segment out chromosomes from cell images, and classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24 types, or for diseased cells to one of the known translocated types. Segmenting out the chromosomes in such images can be especially laborious and is often done manually, if there are overlapping chromosomes in the image which are not easily separable by image processing techniques. Many techniques have been proposed to automate the segmentation and classification of chromosomes from spread images with reasonable accuracy, but given the criticality of the domain, a human in the loop is often still required. In this paper, we present a method to segment out and classify chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of crowdsourcing, preprocessing and deep learning, wherein the non-expert crowd from CrowdFlower is utilized to segment out the chromosomes from the cell image, which are then straightened and fed into a (hierarchical) deep neural network for classification. Experiments are performed on 400 real healthy patient images obtained from a hospital. Results are encouraging and promise to significantly reduce the cognitive burden of segmenting and karyotyping chromosomes. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cells; Chromosomes; Computer vision; Crowdsourcing; Cytology; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Chromosome segmentation; Deep classifications; Human-in-the-loop; Image processing technique; Metaphase chromosomes; Overlapping chromosomes; Patient images; Reasonable accuracy; Image segmentation",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21607508,9781538607336,,,"English","IEEE Comput.

With all these years’ rapid development in wireless communication, high demands for broadband mobile wireless communications and the emergence of new wireless multimedia applications have constituted the motivation to the development of broadband wireless access technologies. The long term evolution (LTE) system has been specified by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) on the way towards fourth-generation (4G) mobile to ensure 3GPP keeping the dominance of the cellular communication technologies.

LTE-A will meet or exceed the requirements of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for the 4G radio communication standard. LTE-A is being specified initially as part of the 3GPP specifications. Where the current generation of mobile telecommunication networks are collectively known as 3G (for “third generation”), LTE is marketed as 4G. In this paper, LTE-A WINNER MIMO uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for the downlink that is, from the base station to the terminal. OFDMA meets the LTE requirement for spectrum flexibility and enables cost-efficient solutions for very wide carriers with high peak rates. The multiple access schemes in LTE downlink uses orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).

Due to the ever increasing demand for more radio spectrum, Cognitive Radio Networks is a one of the solution for this crisis. Security is the one of the basic issue to implement a better CRN. CRN is established in a open communication environment that's why CRN are more vulnerable to security threats than wired networks. Black hole attack is one of the most common attack in CR-VANETs. If the Ad-hoc networks are affected by this attack, it not able to perform effectively. In this situation as a consequence the process of any event detection severely affected. The affected nodes can lead to discrepancies in data analysis and hence come with an erroneous report. We have proposed a simple scheme for recognition of malicious node in Black Hole attack in CR-VANET.

Detection of breast cancer at the initial stages increases the probability of survival of the patient. Mammography has been one of the most reliable methods for early detection of this disease. Computer-Aided diagnosis (CAD) of mammograms has received great attention because of its speed, consistency and providing a better solution for automatic detection of breast cancer. However, poor visibility of mammographic image addresses the necessity of accurate segmentation technique. In this paper we have introduced a novel and advanced kernel based fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering technique for segmentation of mammographic masses. To improve the accuracy of the segmentation process two important parameters that convey the properties of masses like 'entropy' and 'intensity mean' of the kernel are taken into account for fuzzification purposes. This kernel is moved across the mammograms to collect all possible values and hence these feature values are exploited as the data of FCM clustering technique. We have also compared the performance of the proposed approach with intensity based conventional FCM clustering technique and have found better segmentation results for both visual interpretation as well as high level detection. © 2016 IEEE.","entropy; intensity mean; kernel based FCM; Mammograms; segmentation","Cluster analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Diseases; Entropy; Mammography; X ray screens; Automatic detection of breast cancer; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); intensity mean; Kernel-based FCM; Mammograms; Probability of survival; Segmentation techniques; Visual interpretation; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509044320,,,"English","Int.

A lot of efforts have been made in the past to find approaches which can detect motion but most methods are limited to particular situations and are not applicable everywhere. This paper proposes another, more robust approach towards object detection using Gaussian Mixture Model for background subtraction and temporal differencing for foreground segmentation that provides a promising result with the application of morphological operations and filtering. The GMM approach is a multimodal approach that faces the constraint of outlier pixels because of sudden illumination changes and commonage pixels among object and background. Other limitations of GMM include its learning rate and the number of models. This paper includes use of GMM and information about temporal gradient using temporal differencing for object detection. By use of adaptive GMM along with temporal differencing methods and filtering in post processing results in successful and robust object detection.

Global segmentation of mass in mammograms is a complex process due to low contrast mammogram images, irregular shape of mass, speculated margins, and the presence of intensity variations of pixels. This work presents a new approach for mass detection in mammograms, which is based on the variational level set function. Mesh-free based radial basis function (RBF) collocation approach is employed for the evolution of level set function for segmentation of breast as well as suspicious mass region. The mesh-based finite difference method (FDM) is used in literature for evolution of level set function. This work also showcases a comparative study of mesh-free and mesh-based approaches. An anisotropic diffusion filter is employed for enhancement of mammograms. The performance of mass segmentation is analyzed by computing statistical measures. Binarized statistical image features (BSIF) and variants of local binary pattern (LBP) are computed from the segmented suspicious mass regions. These features are given as input to the supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify suspicious mass region as mass (abnormal) or non-mass (normal) region. Validation of the proposed algorithm is done on sample mammograms taken from publicly available Mini-mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) datasets. Combined BSIF features perform better as compared to LBP variants with the performance reported as 97.12% sensitivity, 92.43% specificity, and 98% AUC with 5.12 FP/I on DDSM dataset; and 95.12% sensitivity, 92.41% specificity, and 95% AUC with 4.01FP/I on MIAS dataset. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Binarized statistical image features; Finite difference method; Local binary pattern; Mammography; Mesh-free based radial basis function","Computational mechanics; Computer aided diagnosis; Finite difference method; Functions; Mammography; Mesh generation; Numerical methods; Radial basis function networks; Rotational flow; Screening; Set theory; Support vector machines; X ray screens; Anisotropic diffusion filters; Computer aided detection systems; Digital database for screening mammographies; Finitedifference methods (FDM); Local binary patterns; Mammographic image analysis; Radial basis functions; Statistical images; Image segmentation; anisotropy; area under the curve; Article; benign breast tumor; breast calcification; breast density; breast lesion; breast tissue; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; contrast enhancement; diffusion; genetic algorithm; human; image analysis; image processing; image segmentation; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; mammography; mesh-free radial basis function; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; algorithm; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; mammography; procedures; validation study; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Mammography; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Sensitivity and Specificity; Support Vector Machine","Kashyap, K.L.email: kanchan.k@iiitdmj.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28549292","English","Comput.

These techniques greatly depend on the accurate extraction of transition regions. Transition region extraction becomes difficult when there is grey level overlapping between foreground and background. Further, the performance of these methods deteriorates when the background and foreground are textured or are of varying intensities. Also, these are applied mostly for single object segmentation. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a robust hybrid method for image segmentation containing single and multiple objects. The proposed method uses a two-dimensional Gabor filter which enhances the boundaries of object regions for better extraction of transition regions. These transition regions undergo morphological operations to get the object contours and object regions. Finally, objects are extracted from the object regions.

In the present work, an error analysis is performed in determining the centroids of circular objects using synthetic images with eight different signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 2.7 to 17.8. In the first stage, four different centroiding algorithms, namely, Center of Mass, Weighted Center of Mass, Späth algorithm, and Hough transform, are studied and compared. The error analysis shows that Späth algorithm performs better than other algorithms. In the second stage, various image preprocessing techniques, consisting of two filters, namely, Median and Wiener, and five image segmentation methods, namely, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) edge detector, basic global thresholding, and Otsu’s global thresholding, are compared to determine the centroids of circular objects using Späth algorithm. It is found that Wiener filter plus LoG edge detector performs better than other preprocessing techniques. Real images of a calibration target (typical in flow diagnostics) and the secondary atomization of water droplets are then considered for centroids detection. These two images are preprocessed using Wiener filter plus LoG edge detector and then processed using Späth algorithm to detect the centroids of circular objects. It is observed that the results of real image of the calibration target and synthetic images are comparable. Also, based on visual inspection, the centroids detected in the real image of water droplets are found to be reasonably accurate. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Centroiding algorithms; Filtering; Image processing; Segmentation","Bioinformatics; Biomedical engineering; Calibration; Drops; Error analysis; Errors; Filtration; Flow control; Flow visualization; Hough transforms; Image analysis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Median filters; Object detection; Object recognition; Signal to noise ratio; Calibration targets; Centroiding; Global thresholding; Image preprocessing; Laplacian of Gaussian; Preprocessing techniques; Secondary atomization; Segmentation methods; Edge detection","Adatrao, S.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: s.adatrao1@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14329360,,,,"English","Comput.

Though optic cup is characterized by the drop in depth from the disc boundary, most existing methods segment the two structures separately and rely only on color and vessel kink based cues due to the lack of explicit depth information in color fundus images. Methods We propose a novel boundary-based Conditional Random Field formulation that extracts both the optic disc and cup boundaries in a single optimization step. In addition to the color gradients, the proposed method explicitly models the depth which is estimated from the fundus image itself using a coupled, sparse dictionary trained on a set of image-depth map (derived from Optical Coherence Tomography) pairs. Results The estimated depth achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.80 with respect to the ground truth. The proposed segmentation method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods on five public datasets. The average dice coefficient was in the range of 0.87–0.97 for disc segmentation across three datasets and 0.83 for cup segmentation on the DRISHTI-GS1 test set. The method achieved a good glaucoma classification performance with an average AUC of 0.85 for five fold cross-validation on RIM-ONE v2. Conclusions We propose a method to jointly segment the optic disc and cup boundaries by modeling the drop in depth between the two structures. Since our method requires a single fundus image per eye during testing it can be employed in the large-scale screening of glaucoma where expensive 3D imaging is unavailable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conditional Random Field; Coupled sparse dictionary; Depth reconstruction; Glaucoma; Optic cup; Optic disc","Color; Drops; Image segmentation; Ophthalmology; Optical tomography; Random processes; Conditional random field; Depth reconstruction; Glaucoma; Optic cups; Optic disc; Sparse dictionaries; Color image processing; Article; disease classification; extraction; eye fundus; fundus camera; glaucoma; human; illumination; image quality; image segmentation; joint; optic disk; optic disk cup; algorithm; glaucoma; optical coherence tomography; Algorithms; Fundus Oculi; Glaucoma; Humans; Optic Disk; Tomography, Optical Coherence","Chakravarty, A.; Centre for Visual Information Technology, International Institute of Information Technology HyderabadIndia; email: arunava.chakravarty@research.iiit.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28734530","English","Comput.

The commonly used similarity measure in the clustering algorithms is the Gaussian kernel function which uses sensitive scaling parameter and when applied to the segmentation of noise contaminated images leads to unsatisfactory performance because of neglecting the spatial pixel information. The present work introduces a novel framework for spectral clustering which embodied local spatial information and fuzzy based similarity measure to tackle the above mentioned issues. In our approach, firstly we filter the noise components from original image by using the spatial and gray-level information. The similarity matrix is then constructed by employing a similarity measure which takes into account the fuzzy c-partition matrix and vectors of the cluster centers obtained by fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. In the last step, spectral clustering technique is realized on derived similarity matrix to obtain the desired segmentation result. Experimental results on segmentation of synthetic and Berkeley benchmark images with noise demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, giving it an edge over the clustering based segmentation method reported in the literature. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","cluster centers; fuzzy c-means clustering; partition matrix; spatial and gray information; Spectral clustering","Cluster analysis; Filtration; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Image segmentation; Object recognition; Cluster centers; Fuzzy C means clustering; Partition matrixes; spatial and gray information; Spectral clustering; Clustering algorithms",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

In this paper, a two level calendar disc scheduling method is proposed to satisfy the quality of service requirements of real-time users. A calendar disc is a continuous time frame of one component carrier. Initially, the level-1 scheduler, namely, the disc scheduler (DS) schedules the packets based on user type, packet type and the supported CA by the user equipment by calculating the DS metric and creates calendar discs. At the next level, level-2 scheduler called super scheduler schedules the packets in frequency domain by processing on those calendar disc created by DS.

The proposed feature is derived using improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and Hilbert transformation technique. The proposed feature uses the difference signal created by mapping of the fluid attenuation inversion recovery segmented region onto T1 and T1-contrast-enhanced MR images. This difference signal is decomposed into various intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using improved CEEMDAN algorithm that effectively captures the texture variations existing in both tumour groups. Then, the Hilbert transformation of resulting IMF is computed that provides the analytic signal representation, thereby giving a better visualisation of the texture difference. The proposed feature is calculated from this analytic signal representation at 97% confidence level. Subsequently, this feature is utilised to calculate a quantitative metric for tumour classification. The proposed metric has been validated on 120 tumorous images taken from brain tumour image segmentation benchmark (BRATS) 2012 dataset and the images taken from Harvard Medical School repository. The results illustrate that proposed metric yields an overall classification accuracy of 100% which is better than existing state-of-art works. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Brain; Functions; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical transformations; Medical imaging; Tumors; Classification accuracy; Contrast-enhanced MR; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Harvard Medical School; Hilbert transformations; Intrinsic Mode functions; Inversion recovery; Quantitative metric; Signal processing","Kaur, T.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, Dr. B.

In order to alleviate the problem of image forgery, a handful of techniques have been presented in the literature to detect forgery either in shadow or reflection. This paper aims to develop a technique to detect the image forgery either in shadow or reflection using features enabled neural network. The proposed technique of image forgery detection contains three important steps, like segmentation, feature extraction and detection. In segmentation, shadow points and reflection points are identified using map-based segmentation and FCM clustering. Then, feature points from the shadow points and reflective parts are extracted by considering texture consistency and strength consistency using LVP operator. The final step of forgery detection is performed using the feed forward neural network, where a new algorithm called ABCLM is developed for training of neural network weights. The performance is analyzed with four existing algorithms using measures such as accuracy and MSE. From the analysis, we understand that the proposed technique obtained the maximum accuracy of 80.49%. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","forgery detection; image forensics; neural network; reflection; shadow; texture","Computer crime; Forensic engineering; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Reflection; Textures; Forgery detections; Image forensics; Image forgery detections; Maximum accuracies; Network weights; Reflection detections; Reflection points; shadow; Feature extraction","Cristin, R.; St. Peter’s Institute of Higher Education and ResearchIndia; email: rcristin2015@gmail.com",,"Science in China Press",1674733X,,,,"English","Sci.

Based on the application scenario, the reliability of the nodes deployed has become more important for trust management evaluation. At the same time, trust management system should not be power killing, complex in terms of computation and processing capability. To convey a noticeable framework, we propose Collaborative Trust based Secure Routing protocol (CTSR) for observing direct and indirect trust values. Here we utilize two-way acknowledgement-based trust framework (2-ACKT) which requires lesser memory resources and minimizes the communication overhead. Our simulation setup for Mobile Adhoc Networks with 2-ACKT framework calculates trust value with both direct and indirect observations based on Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of uncertain reasoning approach respectively. Since the inception of DST for indirect observation in wireless networks trust values are effectively derived with data packets and control packets. The capability of DST to solve the problems with different reliability has flaws in certain areas where the nodes were subjected to disclose critical information like residual energy level and available bandwidth. And also common results derived from DST may lead to uncertain decisions. Considering all these factors we make few notable modifications in DST to enhance the security feature in 2-ACT. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-ACKT; Dempster-Shafer theory; Mobile Ad-hoc networks; Throughput","Ad hoc networks; Bandwidth; Bayesian networks; Computation theory; Formal logic; Inference engines; Military applications; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Probabilistic logics; Sensor nodes; Throughput; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; 2-ACKT; Communication overheads; Dempster-Shafer theory; Design and Development; Indirect trust values; Trust management systems; Trust-based Secure Routing; Wireless communications; Mobile ad hoc networks","Sargunavathi, S.; St Joseph’s College of Engineering, Sholinganallur, India; email: rndsargunavathi@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",1383469X,,,,"English","Mobile Networks Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015618888

In this paper, we study the scenario where a user wants to identify the best RoI in a city. The user expresses relevance through a set of keywords denoting PoIs. Ideally, the RoI should be small enough in size such that the user can conveniently explore the PoIs. On the other hand, it should be as relevant as possible. How does one balance the importance of size versus relevance? To a user exploring the RoI on foot, size is more critical. However, for a user equipped with a vehicle, relevance is a more important factor. In this paper, we solve this dilemma through skyline subgraph queries on keyword-embedded road networks. Skyline subgraphs subsume the choice of optimization function for an RoI since the optimal RoI for any rational user is necessarily a part of the skyline set. Our analysis reveals that the problem of computing the skyline set is NP-hard. We overcome the computational bottleneck by proposing a polynomial-time approximation algorithm called SkyGraph. To further expedite the running time, we develop an index structure, Partner Index, that drastically prunes the search space and provides up to 3 orders of magnitude speed-up on real road networks over the baseline approach.

The paper demonstrates that the design of a compact size dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) covering wide range of frequency with multiple modes is possible by selecting the value of p less than 1 (p < 1), where p is number of half-wave variations in the z-direction of TEmnp modes. An orthogonal feed has been used to cancel out the undesired modes. Simulations and experimental measurements were carried out to verify the proposed idea.

Automated segmentation of Magnetic Resonance (MR) brain images would be of great assistance to radiologist, as they minimize the complication evolved due to human interface and offer quicker segmentation results. Automated algorithms offer minimal time duration and lesser manual intervention to a radiologist during clinical diagnosis. Moreover, larger volumes of patient data could be assessed with the aid of an automated algorithm and one such algorithm is proposed through this research to identify the tumor region bounded between normal tissue regions and edema portions. The proposed algorithm offers a better support to a radiologist in the process of diagnosing the pathologies, since; it utilizes both optimization and clustering techniques. Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO) and Modified Fuzzy K − Means algorithm (MFKM) are the optimization and clustering techniques used to render efficient MR brain image analysis. The proposed combinational algorithm is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization based Fuzzy C − Means algorithm (PSO based FCM), Modified Fuzzy K − Means (MFKM) and conventional FCM algorithm. The suggested methodology is evaluated using the comparison parameters such as sensitivity, Specificity, Jaccard Tanimoto Co − efficient Index (TC) and Dice Overlap Index (DOI), computational time and memory requirement. The algorithm proposed through this paper has produced appreciable values of sensitivity and specificity, which are 97.14% and 93.94%, respectively.

Since the channel coefficients are rapidly varying over time and the base station has to perform the estimation task from the received composite signal, the exact solution to this joint estimation problem requires multidimensional search which is computationally intensive. We propose an iterative technique for the joint estimation of DSCs and CFOs based on space alternating generalized expectation maximization algorithm which will decompose the multidimensional optimization to many one dimensional searches. The proposed method works even in the presence of residual timing offsets and it does not require the knowledge of channel statistics at the receiver. Convergence properties of the proposed algorithm in terms of rate matrix is studied and analytically proved that the proposed joint estimation algorithm converges. Simulation studies illustrate that the proposed technique offers good performance even at very high mobile speeds. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carrier frequency offset (CFO); Doubly selective channel (DSC); Multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MIMO-OFDMA)","Carrier communication; Channel estimation; Codes (symbols); Communication channels (information theory); Feedback control; Frequency allocation; Frequency estimation; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Maximum principle; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multiuser detection; Optimization; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Telecommunication repeaters; Carrier frequency offsets; Convergence properties; Doubly selective channel; Joint estimation problems; Multidimensional optimization; Multidimensional search; Orthogonal frequency division multiple access; Space alternating generalized expectation maximization; Frequency division multiple access","Muneer, P.; Department of Electrical Engineering, King Khalid UniversitySaudi Arabia; email: muneerpmun@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013140431

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirements. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antennas with metamaterial on the substrate for UWB application is proposed. Three different dimensions with line feed are analyzed in this paper. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0. The performance parameters such as, bandwidth, gain and return loss of the proposed antennas are compared. © 2016 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Gain; Metamaterial; Microstrip antenna; Pentagon Shape; Return loss","Antennas; Bandwidth; Dielectric materials; Metamaterial antennas; Metamaterials; Microstrip devices; Slot antennas; Surface waves; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Wireless telecommunication systems; Gain; Micro-strip patch antennas; Pentagon Shape; Performance parameters; Return loss; Substrate thickness; Surface wave generation; Wireless application; Microstrip antennas",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

Most of the practical images have directional features, edges, curves, lines and texture singularities as high frequency components of the images. When denoising algorithms are implemented, it is very important that such singularities should be preserved, as these singularities are essential to retain satisfactory visual quality along with important image features.

The aim of this study is to propose a solution which can be used to identify TB's presence and start treating such suspected patients. In this paper, we propose a method to use city block measure for segmenting x-ray image which helps in diagnosis of TB. Initially image processing concepts like canny edge detection techniques are applied to x-ray image for preprocessing it. Later K-means clustering algorithm is applied on preprocessed x-ray image to get segmented x-ray image. The outputs of TB x-ray and normal x-ray image are compared and analyzed with sqEuclidean and city block distance measure. Finally the City block distance measure results are found to be more appropriate for segmenting TB x-ray and normal x-ray image. Segmented x-ray image helps doctors in identifying tuberculosis presence, so that early treatment planning can be made on suspected patients without waiting for the exact medical test reports. The advantage of this approach is the ability to interpret x-ray image to know whether it is a TB affected x-ray or normal x-ray. © 2016 IEEE.","Clustering; Image mining; Segmentation; Tuberculosis","Clustering algorithms; Diagnosis; Edge detection; Image processing; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; X ray analysis; Canny edge detection; City-block distances; Clustering; Image mining; Infectious disease; K-Means clustering algorithm; Treatment planning; Tuberculosis; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation architecture and the convoluted mixture of deep experts (CMoDE) fusion technique that enables a multi-stream deep neural network to learn features from complementary modalities and spectra, each of which are specialized in a subset of the input space. Our model adaptively weighs class-specific features of expert networks based on the scene condition and further learns fused representations to yield robust segmentation. We present results from experimentation on three publicly available datasets that contain diverse conditions including rain, summer, winter, dusk, fall, night and sunset, and show that our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art.

Most of the modern operating systems today use attack prevention techniques based on No-eXecute (NX) memory page protection scheme, which prevents execution of malicious code injected into the device.

The posts of the users of the social media are used by many companies in the world to find the mentality of the users, the current trend of the market and many more things. But still, there is a latent potential in the social network. One of the aspect that we were able to discover was about finding the relationship between the users (i.e., especially, the negative link) on the social network using the posts that the users make and the reaction of the other users towards it. The prediction of the negative link can be applied in the cyber security field, to observe the aberrations in the network and further find the malicious nodes in the social network; say, if two nodes are doing things together even though there is no relation between them. It can also be used in improving the recommendation system in social media as if there is some probability between the two nodes of being the enemy or disliking each other then we can remove them from each other's recommendation list or could assign a lower weight to them in our recommendation algorithm. To achieve all this relationship between the nodes we first need to find whether the user is posting posts with positive emotion (like happy, excited, etc.) or negative emotion (like angry, sad, etc.) so that we can further analyze the mentality of the user and use it to recommend the people who we have previously classified with the similar personality. For that, we have used the sentiment analysis, which divides the users into five simple categories: Extremely +ve(i.e.,positive), +ve, Neutral, -ve (i.e.,negative) and Extremely -ve. This research paper explains the methodologies that we have used to achieve the prediction of negative links between the nodes in the social network. © 2017 IEEE.","Negative Link Prediction; Sentiment Analysis; Social Networks","Behavioral research; Data mining; Forecasting; Mobile computing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cyber security; Disruptive innovations; Link prediction; Malicious nodes; Positive emotions; Recommendation algorithms; Research papers; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043729,,,"English","Int.

The geometrical, shape and orientation features have been used to correctly classify the segmented objects as exudates or false pixels. The proposed technique has a high specificity and eliminates false positives correctly when applied across a wide range of images. The exudates segmented have a high degree of accuracy and no false positives are generated in case of non-diseased images.

Intensity inhomogeneity often is a major problem in dental x-rays which causes considerable difficulties in segmentation. For better computer-aided diagnosis in dentistry, having a precise tooth segmentation is a critical task, as the cysts and inflammatory lesions generally occur around tooth root areas and these areas in radiographs are generally subject to noise, poor contrast, and very uneven illumination. This paper presents an effective segmentation method using a combinational approach of Local Gaussian Distribution fitting energy along with level sets. Here the local intensities of images are defined by Gaussian distributions which are combined with the level set function for accurate segmentations of teeth contour.

Specifically, the transmitter employs a transmit antenna selection (TAS) technique; the legitimate receiver uses either a selection combining (SC) or a maximal-ratio combining (MRC) scheme; and the eavesdropper adopts the MRC technique. Exact closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability are derived for both SC and MRC schemes at the legitimate receiver, which are applicable for arbitrary number of power distributed jamming signals. An asymptotic secrecy outage analysis is conducted, which shows that the diversity gains for all combining schemes equal to the product of the number of antennas at the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Representative numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effects of the key system parameters on the secrecy outage performance. Finally, the proposed analysis is validated through Monte Carlo simulation results. © 2017 IEEE.","Jamming; Multiple antennas; Secrecy outage performance; Wiretap channels","Antennas; Intelligent systems; Mobile computing; Monte Carlo methods; Outages; Rayleigh fading; Transmitters; Wireless telecommunication systems; Closed-form expression; Distributed jamming; Maximal ratio combining (MRC); Multiple antenna; Secrecy outage probabilities; Secrecy outages; Transmit antenna selection; Wire-tap channels; Jamming",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043729,,,"English","Int.

Breast region segmentation is an essential step in the analysis of digital mammograms. Accurate image segmentation leads to better detection of cancer. It aims at separating out Region of Interest (ROI) from rest of the image. The procedure begins with removal of labels, annotations and tags from the mammographic image using morphological opening method. Sliding Window Algorithm (SWA) is used for removal of pectoral muscle from mammograms which is necessary as the intensity values of pectoral muscles are similar to that of ROI which makes it difficult to separate out. After removing the pectoral muscle, Dispersed Region Growing Algorithm (DRGA) is used for segmentation of mammogram which disperses seeds in different regions instead of a single bright region. To demonstrate the validity of our segmentation method, 322 mammographic images from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database are used. The dataset contains mediolateral oblique (MLO) view of mammograms. Experimental results on MIAS dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","CAD; Dispersed Region Growing Algorithm (DRGA); Image segmentation; Mammography; Sliding Window Algorithm (SWA)","Computer aided design; Diagnosis; Diseases; Mammography; Muscle; X ray screens; Digital mammogram segmentation; Mammographic image analysis; Medio-lateral oblique views; Morphological opening; Region growing algorithm; Region segmentation; Segmentation methods; Sliding window algorithms; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062379,,,"English","Int.

The study of the Computed Tomography (CT) images considers image segmentation a very important and vital part in identifying the different kinds of tumor. The classification of the tumor and the non-tumor images followed by the segmentation of tumor region in CT images is done by the proposed methodology. The process of classifying is carried out by Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernel functions and optimization techniques. This SVM classifier with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is predominant over the other methodologies in the analysis of classification process. The segmentation process after the classification process is performed by the Modified Region Growing (MRG) with threshold optimization. As regards the threshold optimization, certain algorithms such as Harmony Search (HS), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) are made use of. It is with the aid of a wide set of performance measures that the results are demonstrated. The comparative analysis in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy is done for the optimization techniques said supra. An accuracy rate of 99.05% in the analysis of segmentation process is obtained using the GWO technique. It is in the working platform of MATLAB that this proposed methodology is implemented. The experimental results obtained depict that the proposed methodology (MRG-GWO) enjoys high accuracy with enhanced tumor detection in total contrast to the other two techniques (HS and EP) in comparison. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Feature extraction; Grey Wolf Optimization; Modified region growing; Segmentation; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Support Vector Machine","Classification (of information); Computer programming; Computerized tomography; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; MATLAB; Optimization; Support vector machines; Tomography; Tumors; Classification process; Comparative analysis; Image processing and computer vision; Optimization techniques; Region growing; Segmentation process; Sequential minimal optimization; Threshold optimization; Image segmentation","Ramakrishnan, T.; Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, National Engineering College, K.R Nagar, Kovilpatti, India; email: tramakrishnanklu@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678655,,,,"English","Pattern Recogn.

This approach is considered than the other biometric authentication methods such as behavioral biometrics which specially includes Keystroke, Speaker Recognition whereas the another side of biometric authentication is Physical biometrics which specially includes Fingerprint Recognition, Voice Recognition, Finger Geometry Recognition and Facial Recognition. From these considerations, the hybrid approach of Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial for iris recognition has been proposed. The novelty of this proposed method results in improving the Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) for the given iris image. In addition to this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for iris image pre-processing. Circular Hough transform (CHT) and Canny edge detection (CED) are applied for iris image segmentation which segments the individual region of the input images. After the image is segmented, Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial have been applied to extract the features from the segmented iris image, which is the most important step for obtaining the texture details, which are independent and uncorrelated even for identical pairs. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for image classification. Perhaps, Feature extraction and Classification of iris image are mainly based on the rich texture details present in iris image. Finally, our proposed system is applied on UBIRIS database and our research experiment provides better accuracy and recognition rates compared to the combined iris recognition techniques such as Fourier transform with SVM, Bernstein polynomial with SVM, Fourier transform with KSVM, Bernstein polynomial with KSVM and hybridization of Fourier and Bernstein polynomial with SVM. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bernstein polynomial; Canny edge detection; Circular Hough transform; Equal error rate; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Fourier transform; Iris image segmentation; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machine; Uncorrelated texture","Authentication; Biometrics; Classification (of information); Digital filters; Edge detection; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Fourier transforms; Hough transforms; Image classification; Image processing; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Polynomials; Singular value decomposition; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Bernstein polynomial; Canny edge detection; Circular Hough transforms; Equal error rate; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Image texture","Ramya, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PSG College of TechnologyIndia; email: ramyam7708@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678655,,,,"English","Pattern Recogn.

Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) is the widely considered imaging practice to record the glioma for the clinical study. Due to its complexity and varied modality, brain MRI needs the automated assessment technique. In this paper, a novel methodology based on meta-heuristic optimization approach is proposed to assist the brain MRI examination. This approach enhances and extracts the tumor core and edema sector from the brain MRI integrating the Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), entropy value, and level set / active contour based segmentation. The proposed method is tested on the images acquired using the Flair, T1C and T2 modalities. The experimental work is implemented and is evaluated using the CEREBRIX and BRAINIX dataset.

Routing in WBAN is classified as QoS based, temperature aware, clusters based routing, postural based, cross layer network based routing etc. These categories are further divided into various protocols. This paper provides a review of some of the existing routing protocols of WBAN by describing their techniques, advantages and disadvantages. Also, the comparison of ATTEMPT (Adaptive Threshold based Thermal unaware Energy-efficient Multi-hop Protocol), SIMPLE (Stable Increased-Throughput Multihop Protocol for Link Efficiency) and EERDT (Energy Efficient and Reliable Data Transfer) protocol has been done by simulating in MATLAB. © 2017 IEEE.","energy efficiency; types of routing in WBAN; WBAN","Artificial intelligence; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Network layers; Network routing; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Comparative analysis; Energy efficient routing; Reliable data transfers; Transmission of data; types of routing in WBAN; WBAN; Wireless body area network; Wireless technologies; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062188,,,"English","IEEE Int.

It is a multi stage procedure. In our work, it begins with collecting the handwriting samples on plain white A4 size paper. Preprocessing steps such as binarization and noise removal etc are performed for better recognition. Initially color image or gray scale image is taken as an input then thresholding is done to convert the image into binary image and noise removal technique is also applied. Then line segmentation, word segmentation and character segmentation have been performed. After each segmentation process, normalization techniques have been applied for normalization purpose to find out space between lines, words and letters in handwriting images. Finally, the mean of the space between all the closed loops formed by the characters has been found out and compared with the word spaces to determine the character. This paper focuses on determination of behavior based on space analysis in handwritten document. The proposed method was tested on more than 500 text image of IAM database and sample handwriting images which are written by different writers on different backgrounds, detects the exact space in between lines, words and characters before and after skew normalization of a document.

This in turn would help to eradicate the problem of portability of bulky pianos by replacing them with just an 'image', thus making it cost efficient. This whole process is subsumed in stages of extracting piano from a real world image, finding the particular key user touch and then generating corresponding key's sound.

Among the elderly population falling/collapsing is a common and very serious issue. It can cause severe injuries like fractures, joint dislocations, head injuries etc. In cases where person is immobilized or lost consciousness it is not possible to seek immediate help or medical attention. There are several cases where elderly people live alone are not found for hours after the fall which makes the situation more severe. The damage caused because of failure in seeking medical attention at the right time is more than the damage and injuries caused by the fall itself. Similar cases can be found with Border Security Force soldiers and other security people standing for long hours guarding the nation borders. Also VIP securities standing in front of VIP homes are vulnerable for such attacks causing injuries. Objective of this paper is to develop a wireless fall-detection system which can sense such situations and alerts others seeking help. The sensors for fall Detection is wearable by the potential-victim/user. Upon detection of fall/collapse the sensor system transmits the information wirelessly, which will be received by the care-Taker's mobile. The sensor is a belt shaped wearable device consisting of accelerometer (tri-Axial) and gyroscope. These sensors are used to classify the posture and dynamics of the user. The main aim of the project is to develop efficient algorithms to detect falls and distinguish between falls and non-falls using these sensors. The sensor is a part of zigbee node. It will communicate to the microcontroller over zigbee. Zigbee will provide an efficient wireless communication with the microcontroller with relatively small hardware size. The microcontroller is responsible for sending information to the Care taker's mobile using a GSM module interfaced to it. The microcontroller is interfaced to a PC in order to burn the program on to the microcontroller and for testing and debugging. © 2017 IEEE.","Fall detection; GSM model; lower quality of life; Tri-Axial accelerometers and Gyroscopes; Wireless Network","Accelerometers; Controllers; Global system for mobile communications; Gyroscopes; Microcontrollers; Mobile security; Program debugging; Software testing; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Zigbee; Border Security Force; Elderly populations; Fall detection; GSM models; Quality of life; Testing and debugging; Triaxial accelerometer; Wireless communications; Wearable sensors",,"PadmaSai Y.Garg D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015603,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Hence, this work proposes a methodology to calculate the network reliability of mobile ad hoc network considering with and without the effect of interference.

They comprise only mobile nodes that use wireless transmission and can be set anywhere and anytime because they eliminate complexity of infrastructure and central admission. The Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are extensively used in different fields such as emergency situations, military applications and mobile communications. The routing is the major issue in the field of MANET due to the mobility nature and lack of infrastructure of the network. The different routing protocols have been proposed to address the routing issue. The development of multipath routing for mobile ad hoc network by considering the performance metrics with standard simulator is an important research area. Hence in this paper, we have chosen Power-Aware Node-disjoint Multipath Source Routing (PNDMSR) to implement and analyze its performance with respective to Multipath Dynamic Source Routing (MDSR) by using various quantitative performance metrics like, routing control overhead, throughput, packet delivery ratio, packet loss and energy efficiency by varying various parameters like network's size, mobility of node, pause time, data rate and load. The main objective of the PNDMSR is selecting energy aware node-disjoint multipath from source to destination by optimizing the overhead using node's cost and it increases the network of lifetime. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy; MANET; MDSR; Overhead; PNDMSR; Routing","Ad hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Military applications; Military communications; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Packet networks; Power management; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Energy; MANET; MDSR; Overhead; PNDMSR; Routing; Power management (telecommunication)",,"PadmaSai Y.Garg D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015603,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It's ability to reach high throughput is promising in both downlink and uplink so for ensuring that a good QoS is experienced by user, an efficient end-to-end model is required.

A robust and novel strategic approach for insertion-extraction of a digital watermark in color images is presented. Watermarks are generally intended to be visible but are invisible. Invisible insertion of the watermark is performed in the most significant regions of the host image such that tampering of that portion to remove or to destroy will degrade the esthetic quality and value of the image. One feature of the algorithm is that these user defined characters are used as a region of interest for the water marking process and eliminates the changes of watermark removal.

Since Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is one of the well-known classical graph problems it finds its application in various fields and many attempts are being done to improve the speed of MST using parallel computing. Most of the previous attempts made were either too complicated to implement or they perform well only on special graphs with regular structure. The widespread adaption of multicore platforms and GPU's has offered the opportunity to explore new implementation techniques for many algorithms that were originally designed for uniprocessors. By formulating new parallel schemes, the programmers would be able to exploit the multiple hardware frameworks offered in today's platforms in a more efficient way. A category of problems among the most challenging to parallelize are the ones that exhibit inherently sequential characteristics. The discovery of the Single Source Shortest Path or the composition of the Minimum Spanning Forest of a given graph falls into this category.

In the present work, a comparative evaluation of two segmentation methods named as active contour and level set is presented. Comparative evaluation of both methods has been done individually by applying on Computed Tomography (CT) abdomen images. Comparative study is done by following steps (i) Preprocessing using morphological functions (ii) Segmentation of liver using active contour/level set algorithms (iii) 3-Dimensional volume reconstruction. Results of applied liver segmentation algorithms are compared with manually performed delineations by radiologist. Volume overlapping of above methods is assessed using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) which gives mean DSC of 93.52%±.62 and 89.48%±.76 in case of active contour and level set method respectively.

Image segmentation is essentially a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper an unsupervised image segmentation method is proposed that is based on a nature inspired clustering approach, Multi-objective Gravitational Search algorithm (MOGSA). A variable agent representation is used to encode the cluster centers with different number of clusters. A new fitness function based on multi-objective optimization is proposed to make the search more efficient and faster. Total number of clusters and cluster centers evolves automatically in proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm considers two objectives, minimize intra-cluster distance, and maximize inter-cluster distance. The proposed method has been applied on standard images and compares the results with K-means clustering, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering and single objective Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA).

This review paper reveals that to enable efficient multiple object detection and tracking under occlusion conditions, the combination of different features such as depth data, geometry, textural, color feature metrics, speed, etc can be taken into consideration. With multiple synchronized cameras set up, 3D techniques including depth estimation, azimuth, texture, color, geometric information and speed etc, in conjunction with optimal trajectory estimation model can be vital for multiple objects tracking under occlusions. In addition, efficient region of interest (ROI) feature extraction, trajectory estimation and feature fusion across synchronized cameras can be explored to track multiple objects under occlusions. Synchronizing multiple cameras with best feature training, association, continuous object skeletal tracking using stochastic trajectory prediction and classification; can be an effective solution, especially for traffic surveillance or outdoor surveillance applications. © 2017 IEEE.","Multiple camera; Multiple Objects detection; Occlusion; Video Surveillance","Cameras; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Monitoring; Object recognition; Security systems; Stochastic systems; Synchronization; Tracking (position); Trajectories; Functional characteristics; Moving object detection and tracking; Multiple cameras; Multiple objects; Multiple-object detections; Object detection and tracking; Occlusion; Video surveillance; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

From the region of interest (ROI) of an iris image, distinctive features are strategically extracted for template creation. The significant part, i.e., the ROI of an iris image, is encrypted in a transformational domain and the nonsignificant region is encrypted in a spatial domain. The advantage of this encryption scheme is increased key space and high degree of security compared to 1-D chaos-based systems. Apart from security, another advantage is reduced computational time compared to conventional encryption schemes implemented in either the spatial or frequency domain. The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of increased key space due to transform orders of the fractional wavelet transform (FrWT) and complex dynamical characteristics of hyperchaos, making the proposed scheme resistant to attacks. The properties of the FrWT and hyperchaos complement each other, making the system efficient and highly robust. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the computational time without compromising the security.

High performance can only be achieved at the cost of high power dissipation. Nowadays, the use of FPGAs is rapidly increasing due to its low cost and smaller time to market. Today’s high end FPGAs are capable of implementing high performance designs such as transceivers for RF application, signal processing and image processing applications etc. This is only possible due to their complex designs that includes on chip dedicated multipliers, Dual RAM blocks, Ethernet and DCMs etc. Since FPGAs consume large amount of power, it becomes a challenge for the designers to implement low power battery operated communication systems. Several power estimation models are available in literature for early stage power estimation of FPGAs in the synthesis design flow but they provide less accuracy (high percentage error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique. This paper presents the limitation of existing power estimation model proposed by Deng. The given model is converted into a script using MATLAB. The power values estimated from the power model (script) are compared with the high level synthesis tool: Xpower Analyzer targeted to Virtex FPGA. For estimation of power values, an embedded multiplier is synthesized for two different configurations: one with ‘CE’ (low power) and another without ‘CE’ for different I/O vector length. The results suggested that the given low level power estimation models provide less accuracy (high % error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique i.e. with ‘CE’. Further, there is a scope of remodel the existing model for the observed shortcoming. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Embedded multiplier; FPGAs; IP block; MATLAB; Power estimation model","Embedded systems; Frequency multiplying circuits; High level synthesis; Image communication systems; Image processing; MATLAB; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Embedded multiplier; High-performance design; Image processing applications; IP block; Low-power synthesis; Power estimations; Wireless communication system; Wireless telecommunication technologies; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Verma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-62, India; email: gaurav.iitkg@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996554617

The proposed clustering algorithm Tree-TWSVC has efficient learning time, achieved due to the tree structure and the formulation that leads to solving a series of systems of linear equations.

In multichannel multiradio wireless mesh networks the channel allocation strategy plays a vital role along with multicast tree construction.

With this paper, we propose a Quality of Service Channel Assignment and multicast Routing (Q-CAR) algorithm. The proposed algorithm jointly solves the channel assignment and multicast tree construction problem by intelligent computational methods. We use a slightly modified differential evolution approach for assigning channels to links. We design a genetic algorithm based multicast tree construction strategy which determines a delay, jitter bounded low cost multicast tree. Moreover, we define a multi objective fitness function for the tree construction algorithm which optimizes interference as well as tree cost.

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other HE-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error.

Essentially, image segmentation is used to assign unique class labels to different regions of an image. In this work, it is transformed into texture segmentation by signifying each class label as a unique texture class. The FD based texture analysis model is suggested for texture feature extraction from images and ISODATA is used for segmentation. The proposed methodology was first implemented on artificial target images and then on remote sensing images from Google Earth. The results of the proposed methodology are compared with those of the other texture analysis methods such as LBP (Local Binary Pattern) and NBP (Neighbors based Binary Pattern) by visual inspection as well as using classification measures derived from confusion matrix.

People uses wireless technology along with sensor for monitoring home held devices, security alerts, natural disasters alert, building supervision, industrial quality management, etc. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of thousands of economical and feasible disposable sensors, deployed in the environment to sense parameters related to the surroundings such as temperature, moisture level, pressure etc., Number of sensor nodes are connected in these networks for communication. Each nodes are self-organized, having the capacity of sense, process, and aggregate data. Energy utilization in WSN is major issue in networks for improving network lifetime. Conventional clustering schemes are created with static cluster heads that die past than the normal nodes that degrade the network performance in routing. It is very vital area to develop an energy aware clustering protocol in WSN to reduce energy consumption for increasing network life time. In this paper, a Energy Aware Clustering using Neuro-fuzzy approach (EACNF) is proposed to form finest and energy aware clusters. The proposed scheme consists of fuzzy subsystem and neural network system that achieved energy efficiency in forming clusters and cluster heads in WSN. EACNF used neural network that provide effective training set related to energy and density of all nodes to estimate the expected energy for Uncertain cluster heads. Sensor nodes with higher energy are trained with various location of base station to select energy aware cluster heads. Fuzzy if–then mapping rule is used in fuzzy logic part that inputs to form clusters and cluster heads. EACNF is designed for WSN that handling Trust factor for security to the network. EACNF used three metric such as transmission range, residual energy and Trust factor for improving network life time. The proposed scheme EACNF is compared with related clustering schemes namely Cluster-Head Election Mechanism using Fuzzy Logic and Energy-Aware Fuzzy Unequal Clustering. The experiment results show that EACNF performs better than the other related schemes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Neural network; Wireless sensor network","Computer circuits; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Neural networks; Power management; Quality management; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster-head elections; Clustering; Conventional clustering; Industrial quality management; Neural network systems; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless technologies; Power management (telecommunication)","Golden Julie, E.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: goldenjuliephd@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994449416

There are various problem associates with this topic like low resolution of image, similarity of kidney stone and prediction of stone in the new image of kidney. Ultrasound images have low contrast and are difficult to detect and extract the region of interest. Therefore, the image has to go through the preprocessing which normally contains image enhancement. The aim behind this operation is to find the out the best quality, so that the identification becomes easier. Medical imaging is one of the fundamental imaging, because they are used in more sensitive field which is a medical field and it must be accurate. In this paper, we first proceed for the enhancement of the image with the help of median filter, Gaussian filter and un-sharp masking.

Accuracy of segmentation approach dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process itself i.e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step. Methods To address the above issues, in this paper a fourth order partial differential equation (FPDE) based nonlinear filter adapted to Poisson noise with fuzzy c-means segmentation method is proposed. This approach is capable of effectively handling the segmentation problem of blocky artifacts while achieving good tradeoff between Poisson noise removals and edge preservation of the microscopic biopsy images during segmentation process for cancer detection from cells. Results The proposed approach is tested on breast cancer microscopic biopsy data set with region of interest (ROI) segmented ground truth images. The microscopic biopsy data set contains 31 benign and 27 malignant images of size 896 × 768. The region of interest selected ground truth of all 58 images are also available for this data set. Finally, the result obtained from proposed approach is compared with the results of popular segmentation algorithms; fuzzy c-means, color k-means, texture based segmentation, and total variation fuzzy c-means approaches. Conclusions The experimental results shows that proposed approach is providing better results in terms of various performance measures such as Jaccard coefficient, dice index, Tanimoto coefficient, area under curve, accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, random index, global consistency error, and variance of information as compared to other segmentation approaches used for cancer detection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cell and nuclei segmentation; Fourt order PDE based nonlinear filter; Fuzzy c-means segmentation; Medical image segmentation; Microscopic biopsy images; Segmentation in presence of Poisson noise","Biopsy; Diseases; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy systems; Image processing; Medical imaging; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear filtering; Poisson equation; Biopsy images; Fourth order partial differential equations; Fuzzy C mean; Nuclei segmentation; Poisson noise; Segmentation algorithms; Segmentation process; Texture-based segmentations; Image segmentation; Article; artifact; benign breast tumor; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; color k means segmentation; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; false negative result; false positive result; fourth order partial differential equation; fuzzy c means segmentation; fuzzy system; image analysis; image segmentation; measurement accuracy; measurement error; noise reduction; nonlinear system; Poisson distribution; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; texture based segmentation; total variation fuzzy c means segmentation; tumor biopsy; algorithm; biopsy; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; human; image processing; neoplasm; Algorithms; Biopsy; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neoplasms","Srivastava, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu UniversityIndia; email: rajeev.cse@iitbhu.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28688490","English","Comput.

It serves as a source of second opinion that radiologists may consider in order to interpret CT images. In this work, the purpose of CAD is to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary bronchitis from CT images of the lung. Methods Left and right lung fields are segmented using optimal thresholding from the lung CT images. Texture and shape features are extracted from the pathology bearing regions. A hybrid feature selection approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) combining cosine similarity and support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to select relevant features. Additionally, tandem run recruitment strategy is included in the selection activity to choose the promising features. The SVM classifier is trained using the selected features and the performance of the trained classifier is evaluated using trivial performance evaluation measures. Results The training and testing datasets used in building the classifier model are disjoint and contains 200 CT slices affected with bronchitis, 50 normal slices and 300 slices with cancer. Out of 100 features extracted from each CT slice, a subset of 60 features is used for classification. ACO with tandem run strategy yielded 81.66% of accuracy whereas ACO without tandem run yielded an accuracy of 77.52%. When all the features are used for classifier training without feature selection algorithm, an accuracy of 75.14% is achieved. Conclusion From the results, it is inferred that identifying relevant features to train the classifier has a definite impact on the classifier performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ant colony optimization; Computer aided diagnosis; Hybrid approach; Pulmonary bronchitis; SVM classification; Tandem run recruitment","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Feature extraction; Support vector machines; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Feature selection algorithm; Hybrid approach; Hybrid feature selections; Pulmonary bronchitis; SVM classification; Tandem run recruitment; Computerized tomography; ant colony optimization; Article; bronchitis; classification algorithm; classifier; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; image segmentation; left lung; lung cancer; noise reduction; right lung; support vector machine; algorithm; bronchitis; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; lung; support vector machine; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Bronchitis; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Lung; Support Vector Machine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Nehemiah, H.K.; Ramanujan Computing Centre, Anna UniversityIndia",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28552117","English","Comput.

Due to these characteristics uncertainty is an integral part of MANET behavior. Uncertainty quantification is important for performance evaluation and better decision making in MANET. Packet dropping is a serious issue in MANET which degrades the performance of the network to a great extent. The packet dropping attack increases uncertainty in the network communication and eventually of the MANET. Trust based routing mechanisms are useful for neutralizing packet dropping attack. There are many existing trust based routing protocols which uses uncertainty for precise trust calculations. Thus, trust and uncertainty are closely related to each other. The paper proposes Uncertainty Analysis Framework (UAF) for MANET, it calculates the network Belief, Disbelief, and Uncertainty (BDU) values. The UAF framework integrated into different trust variants of AODV protocol which use direct trust, indirect trust, and global trust. The research work discovers impact of different trust models on MANET BDU using various mobility models.

Hence, in this paper, the features of quantum computing are exploited to introduce four different quantum inspired meta-heuristic techniques to accelerate the execution of multi-level thresholding. The proposed techniques are Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithm, Quantum Inspired Simulated Annealing, Quantum Inspired Differential Evolution and Quantum Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is exhibited in comparison with the backtracking search optimization algorithm, the composite DE method, the classical genetic algorithm, the classical simulated annealing, the classical differential evolution and the classical particle swarm optimization for ten real life true colour images. The experimental results are presented in terms of optimal threshold values for each primary colour component, the fitness value and the computational time (in seconds) at different levels. Thereafter, the quality of thresholding is judged in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio for each technique. Moreover, statistical test, referred to as Friedman test, and also median based estimation among all techniques, are conducted separately to judge the preeminence of a technique among them. Finally, the performance of each technique is visually judged from convergence plots for all test images, which affirms that the proposed quantum inspired particle swarm optimization technique outperforms other techniques. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Colour image thresholding; Friedman test; Huang's method; Kapur's method; Median based estimation; Meta-heuristic method; Quantum computing","Codes (symbols); Color; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Image segmentation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quantum computers; Signal to noise ratio; Simulated annealing; Colour image; Friedman test; Huang's method; Kapur's method; Meta-heuristic methods; Quantum Computing; Optimization","Dey, S.; Department of Information Technology, Camellia Institute of Technology, Madhyamgram, India; email: dsandip_vc@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

Current techniques for suppressing SI rely on generating a copy of the SI signal and subtracting it partly in the radio frequency (RF) and digital domains. A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation of the multipath channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to the antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath reflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and digital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the analog and the digital domain. In this paper, using a linearization technique, we show that the self-interference channel in an indoor environment can be effectively modeled as H(f)=C0-C1f in the frequency domain. Thus, the effective self-interference channel can be represented by two parameters C0 and C1, irrespective of the multipath environment. We also provide experimental evidence to verify the above channel model and propose novel low-complexity designs for self-interference cancellation. © 2017 IEEE.","Full-duplex radios; self-interference cancellation; self-interference channel; wireless communication","Digital radio; Frequency domain analysis; Multipath propagation; Radio transmission; Wireless telecommunication systems; Experimental evidence; Full-duplex radios; Linearization technique; Multi-path environments; Number of multipath; Self-interferences; Taylor series approximation; Wireless communications; Signal interference","Ganti, R.K.; Department of Electrical EngineeringIndia; email: rganti@ee.iitm.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361276,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Therefore, monitoring the respiratory rate by detecting the different breath phases is crucial. Objectives This study aimed to segment the breath cycles from pulmonary acoustic signals using the newly developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on breath phase detection and to subsequently evaluate the performance of the system. Methods The normalised averaged power spectral density for each segment was fuzzified, and a set of fuzzy rules was formulated. The ANFIS was developed to detect the breath phases and subsequently perform breath cycle segmentation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient values were calculated and analysed, and the proposed method was then validated using data collected at KIMS Hospital and the RALE standard dataset. Results The analysis of the correlation coefficient of the neuro-fuzzy model, which was performed to evaluate its performance, revealed a correlation strength of r = 0.9925, and the RMSE for the neuro-fuzzy model was found to equal 0.0069. Conclusion The proposed neuro-fuzzy model performs better than the fuzzy inference system (FIS) in detecting the breath phases and segmenting the breath cycles and requires less rules than FIS. © 2017","Breath phase detection; Correlation coefficient; Neuro-fuzzy; Respiratory rate; Respiratory sound signal; Root mean square error; Segmentation","Correlation detectors; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Image segmentation; Mean square error; Power spectral density; Signal detection; Spectral density; Tracking (position); Breath-phase detections; Correlation coefficient; Neuro-Fuzzy; Respiratory rate; Respiratory sounds; Root mean square errors; Fuzzy inference; abnormal respiratory sound; accuracy; algorithm; Article; breath analysis; breathing; breathing rate; fuzzy system; human; major clinical study; methodology; spectrometry; standard; acoustics; artificial neural network; breathing rate; fuzzy logic; physiologic monitoring; procedures; sleep disordered breathing; Acoustics; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Neural Networks (Computer); Respiration; Respiratory Rate; Sleep Apnea Syndromes","Palaniappan, R.; School of Electronics Engineering (SENSE), VIT UniversityIndia; email: prkmect@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28552127","English","Comput.

Existing WiNoC architectures generally use millimeter-wave antennas without significant directional gains, along with token passing protocol to access the shared wireless medium. This limits the achievable performance benefits since only one wireless pair can communicate at a time. It is also not practical in the immediate future to arbitrarily scale up the number of non-overlapping channels by designing transceivers operating in disjoint frequency bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum commonly adopted for on-chip wireless interconnects. Consequently, we explore the use of directional antennas whereby multiple wireless interconnect pairs can communicate simultaneously. However, concurrent wireless communications can result in interference. This can be minimized in NoC by optimal placement of wireless interfaces (WIs) to maximize performance while minimizing interference. To address this, we propose an interference-aware WIs placement algorithm with routing strategy for WiNoC architecture by incorporating directional planar log-periodic antennas (PLPAs). This directional wireless network-on-chip (DWiNoC) architecture enables point-to-point links between transceivers and hence multiple wireless links can operate at the same time without interference. © 2017 IEEE.","Directional antenna; interference-aware placement; on-chip interconnection networks; wireless network-on-chip","Antenna arrays; Antennas; Computer architecture; Directive antennas; Frequency bands; Integrated circuit interconnects; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Log periodic antennas; Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Network architecture; Radio transceivers; Servers; Transceivers; Wireless interconnects; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Achievable performance; Directional Antenna; Interference-aware; Millimeter wave spectra; Millimeter-wave antennas; Multiple wireless links; On-chip interconnection network; Wireless communications; Network-on-chip",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23327766,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The conventional non-imaging screening test for prostate cancer like prostate antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) tests generally lack specificity. Ultrasound is the most commonly available, inexpensive, non-invasive, and radiation-free imaging modality among all the screening imaging modalities available for prostate cancer diagnosis. The precise segmentation of prostate contours in ultrasound images is crucial in applications such as the exact placement of needles during biopsies, computing the prostate gland volume, and to localize the prostate cancer. Moreover, the low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy treatment in which radioactive seeds are implanted in the prostate region requires accurate contouring of the prostate gland in ultrasound images. Therefore, it is very important to segment the prostrate region accurately for the diagnosis and treatment. This paper aims to present the analysis of existing approaches used for the segmentation of prostate in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images.

The algorithm overcomes the inherent limitations of the US image modality: Nonuniform density; missing boundaries; and strong speckle noise. We introduced a 'guitar' structure that represents the negative space surrounding the thalamic regions. The guitar acts as a landmark for deriving the widest points of the thalamus even when its boundaries are not identifiable. We augmented a generalized level-set framework with a shape prior and constraints derived from statistical shape models of the guitars; this framework was used to segment US images and measure the thalamic diameter. Our segmentation method achieved a higher mean Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, specificity, and reduced contour leakage when compared to other well-established methods. The automatic thalamic diameter measurement had an interobserver variability of-0.56 2.29 mm compared to manual measurement by an expert sonographer. Our method was capable of automatically estimating the thalamic diameter, with the measurement accuracy on par with clinical assessment. Our method can be used as part of computer-assisted screening tools that automatically measure the biometrics of the fetal thalamus; these biometrics are linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2013 IEEE.","Fetal brain; image segmentation; statistical shape model (SSM); thalamus; Ultrasound (US)","Biometrics; Brain; Brain mapping; Musical instruments; Ultrasonics; Automated algorithms; Automatic measurements; Diameter Measurement; Interobserver variability; Measurement accuracy; Similarity coefficients; Statistical shape model; thalamus; Image segmentation; biometry; fetus; fetus brain; fetus echography; human; image segmentation; measurement accuracy; screening; statistical model; thalamus; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; female; fetus echography; image processing; neuroimaging; pregnancy; procedures; statistical model; thalamus; Algorithms; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Statistical; Neuroimaging; Pregnancy; Thalamus; Ultrasonography, Prenatal",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21682194,,ITIBF,"27333614","English","IEEE J.

We consider three commonly used feature extraction techniques, namely, the Local Binary Patterns (LBP), the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and the curvelet transforms to extract features from the images on the JAFFE data set. A subset of these features is then selected using the Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR), the Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM) and the minimum Redundancy maximum Relevance (mRMR) methods. The original feature sets and the subsets are then used to train a PBL-McRBFN classifier. We conduct a subject independent study with 10 cross validations on the JAFFE data set. The average performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier with the different feature sets and subsets are compared. In general, feature selection methods used along with the feature extraction techniques help to perform emotion recognition more efficiently. It is also observed that the subset of features selected using the mRMR on the features extracted from the SIFT technique (SIFT+mRMR+PBL-McRBFN) is the most discriminative feature subset. A statistical paired t-test also ascertains this observation. We also compare the performance of the SIFT+mRMR+PBL-McRBFN with the other results in the literature for this problem.

Future services and business models require efficient provisioning with enhanced traffic management. It is hard to meet these requirements on today's mobile networks that are deployed over specialized hardware. While operators are keen to adopt NFV (Network Function Virtualization) to virtualize their networks, virtualized mobile network deployments face a few technical barriers. To address these challenges, we design SCOPE that effectively applies concepts from SDN and distributed systems to realize NFV-based LTE core networks. Using centralized allocation, SCOPE effectively manages the resources across multiple telecom data-centers in a way to meet the traffic requirements.

However SC-FDMA is very sensitive to carrier frequency offset(CFO), which affects the error rate performance of the system adversely. This paper proposes an efficient signal processing technique known as fractional Fourier transform(FRFT) for Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing(SCFDM) over Nakagami-m fading channel in the presence of CFO. A clear improvement has been shown in symbol error rate(SER) by using FRFT block in place of FFT block. Simulation results confirm that FRFT-SCFDM outperforms FFT-SCFDM as its probability of error can be controlled by varying FRFT angle(α) without significant increase in the complexity. Further, we have compared the FRFT implementations of SCFDM and OFDM and observed a gain of 7 dB for FRFT-SCFDM over FRFT-OFDM at CFO(ϵ) equals 0.1. Further, no change in PAPR, no significant increase in complexity with improved SER performance or quality of service(QoS) motivates FRFT-SCFDMA to be one of the potential candidates for uplink transmission for 5G radio access networks(RAN). © 2017 IEEE.","Bit error rate; Carrier Frequency Offset; Fourier transforms; FRFT; OFDM; QoS; RAN; SCFDMA","Bit error rate; Carrier communication; Complex networks; Errors; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Fast Fourier transforms; Fourier transforms; Frequency allocation; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Quality of service; Radio transmission; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; 3rd generation partnership project (3gpp) long term evolutions; Carrier frequency offsets; Fractional Fourier transforms; FRFT; Orthogonal frequency division multiple access; SC-FDMA; Single carrier frequency division multiple access(SCFDMA); Singlecarrier frequency-division-multiplexing (SCFDM); Frequency division multiple access",,"Papadias C.B.Jamalipour A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015252,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The data is sent using various wireless technologies to application servers present in the IoT cloud via intermediate gateways. Using traditional routing techniques to connect millions of IoT devices to the Internet result in congestion and overloading of gateways leading to drop in throughput of IoT networks. To improve the throughput, the use of multiple wireless technologies for parallel data transmission known as Parallel Opportunistic Routing (POR) has been proposed in the literature. However, in POR the data from a source gateway to the Internet always follows the same path. This leads to congestion in certain gateways which in turn affects the throughput. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive and load balanced routing technique called Adaptive Routing using Multi-technologY and Load balancer (ARMY-Lancer) for maximizing IoT networks' throughput by distributing the load across the network. Through extensive simulations, we show that ARMY-Lancer outperforms POR and load balanced routing using a single technology in terms of network throughput and average load across the gateways. © 2017 IEEE.","Heterogeneous IoT network; Internet of Things; IoT gateway; Performance evaluation; Routing; Solution Specific Gateway","Internet of things; Network routing; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Heterogeneous sensing; Internet of Things (IOT); IOT networks; Multiple wireless technologies; Opportunistic routing; Parallel data transmission; Performance evaluation; Routing; Gateways (computer networks)",,"Papadias C.B.Jamalipour A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015252,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Considering the aforementioned random impairments, we characterize a new quartic mixture random polynomial with three independent variables in this paper. In particular, we derive the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the new quartic mixture random variable. Later on, it has been shown that the newly characterized mixture random variable can be effectively used in the error performance analysis of various FSO communication systems eg., single channel FSO link and cascaded FSO system etc. Moreover, by utilizing the derived PDF and CDF, we can easily obtain the expressions of average error probabilities for different optical wireless communication (OWC) systems with arbitrary constellations. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Atmospheric turbulence; Distribution functions; Mixtures; Probability; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Random variables; Wireless telecommunication systems; Average error probability; Cumulative distribution function; Error performance analysis; Free space optical communication systems; Gamma-gamma distribution; Optical wireless communication systems; Probability density function (pdf); Rayleigh distributions; Optical communication",,"Papadias C.B.Jamalipour A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015252,,,"English","IEEE Int.

With most of the high data rate demands originating from indoor User Equipments (UEs), conventional wired backhaul links prove to be a major bottleneck. Hence, mmWave wireless backhaul links are explored at Femto Base Stations (FBSs). In order to derive maximum benefit of mmWave backhaul links, efficient resource (data slots) utilization is necessary. Proper scheduling of mmWave backhaul links will help to achieve the same. In this paper, we propose a novel FBS-to-FBS (F2F) communication scheme which not only helps in offloading the data traffic from the Micro Base Station (MiBS) but also can act as a relay link for the other FBSs for routing the backhaul traffic to the MiBS. We also propose a solution to concurrently schedule mmWave wireless backhaul links to increase the resource utilization considering the coexistence of both FBS-to-MiBS (F2M) and F2F links. Our proposed solution consists of two parts - first, it determines which backhaul links can be scheduled concurrently by finding the upper bound for the interfering distance based on the alignment of different lobes of the directional antennas. Second, the transmit power is throttled to match the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of each link aiming to further control the interference and to increase the number of concurrent transmissions. The benefits of the proposed solution are studied and compared with the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and random scheduling schemes using extensive simulations. © 2017 IFIP.","5G cellular network; backhaul link scheduling; FBS-to-FBS (F2F) communication; mmWave; power control; QoS","Base stations; Concurrency control; Directive antennas; Femtocell; Millimeter waves; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power control; Quality control; Quality of service; Scheduling; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Backhaul links; Cellular network; Concurrent transmission; Extensive simulations; Millimeter waves (mmwave); mm-Wave; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Time division multiple accesses (TDMA); Time division multiple access",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9783901882906,,,"English","Int.

So, this paper mainly aims at designing a suitable receiver for MC-CDMA system to mitigate such MAI. The classical receivers like maximal-ratio combining and minimum mean square error fail to cancel MAI when the MC-CDMA is subjected to nonlinear distortions, which may occur due to saturated power amplifiers or arbitrary channel conditions. Being highly nonlinear structures, the neural network (NN) receivers such as multilayer perceptron and radial basis function networks could be better alternative for such a case.

Climatology attempts to analyze and explain the impact of climate so that the society can plan accordingly. Climatology analysis is often done on radar images representing various climatic conditions. These images contain varying scale of severity for any specific climatic parameter of study. The climatologists often find it convenient to analyze climatic conditions if tools are available to segment the weather images based on the severity scale which is represented by different colors. Segmentation of the weather radar image is also used for automated analysis of weather conditions. Differential evolution (DE) approach instead is used for fast selection of optimal threshold. In present paper, we have applied DE with multilevel thresholding for weather image segmentation which results in minimum computational time and excellent image quality. A new mutation strategy for DE named reconstructed differential evolution (RDE) strategy is suggested for better performance over image segmentation.

Due to these factors or capabilities, patch antennas are able to overcome the rising demands in the field of wireless communication like high gain, high power, maximized throughput and low losses. Metamaterials are the synthetic materials that are engineered to have some exclusive properties those are not found in any naturally existing materials. These materials possess their properties due to their structure and not because of the material they are composed of. The stacking of patch antennas i.e. The use of one patch over other is an effective method to improve their performance for the dual frequency and broadband operation which is required in most of the high frequency wireless applications. The closure between the two conducting surfaces subjected to an excitation will lead to a strong mutual coupling between them. This is the reason for the bandwidth enhancement and the use of it for operation at multiple frequencies. The objective of the work presented in the paper is to study the performance of the patch antenna by stacking its dielectric with a metamaterial. The paper presents a theoretical study of the use of metamaterial superstrates to improve the performance of patch antennas. The output parameters of patch antenna without and with the metamaterial superstrate were obtained using MATLAB and their comparison is done to understand the effect of the metamaterial when it is used in a patch antenna. © 2016 IEEE.","enhanced performance etc; high frequency; metamaterial superstrates; Micrsostrip; patch antenna; wireless applications","Antennas; MATLAB; Metamaterial antennas; Metamaterials; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Structure (composition); Wireless telecommunication systems; enhanced performance etc; High frequency HF; Micrsostrip; Superstrates; Wireless application; Microstrip antennas","Mahamuni, C.V.; Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Fr.

Antennas employed in such systems have certain requirements: High gain, stable and omni-directional radiation pattern, reduced interference. This paper presents a compact dual band monopole antenna suitable for 2.4/5 GHz WLAN application. The antenna is fabricated on an FR4 substrate of size 20 × 30 × 0.8 mm3 and consists of multiple meandering lines connected to the 50-Ohm microstrip feed signal line to generate the desired dual resonance frequencies. Two impedance bandwidths, for S11≤-10 dB, of 240 MHz and 2570 MHz have been obtained from simulation results which show that the required bandwidths of IEEE 802.11b/g (2.4-2.485 GHz) and IEEE 802.11a (5.15-5.825 GHz) can be completely covered by the proposed antenna. Prototype of the proposed antenna shows good agreement between simulated and measured results. Improved bandwidth and nearly omni-directional radiation pattern of the proposed antenna at both resonance frequencies make it a viable choice for integration into modern portable devices.

It encompasses arms, ammunition weapons, tools and confidential data. A large number of soldiers are active at the national borders and hostile regions to safeguard the civilian people and enhance the security to them; though, in the case of any emergency, some mechanism based on the modern electronics and technology is essential to alert the military officers active in surveillance areas so that they can make a prompt arrangement to lock the security and tighten the forces. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication which can play an effective role in the monitoring of the remote areas for applications like military surveillance, seismic activity monitoring, earthquake detection and disaster relief operations etc. The nodes are randomly deployed in the sensor field for such applications because of which the density of nodes in some part of the area to be monitored will be more and other areas might be very less. Another problem is the physical access to sensor nodes in these areas is extremely challenging, so the human intervention is not easy. Thus, the replacement of nodes or recharging their batteries is practically impossible. The paper presents a prototype model of the surveillance system for the military application using wireless sensor networks and the work progress accomplished till now has been reported.

In the yester years, the segmentation of target and the organs at risk was done by the doctor himself which is very tedious. But now, with the developments in the fields of technology, computerized algorithms are used for the purpose of delineating the organs at risk. The images used for treatment planning are usually CT images. This is because, the density information obtained in CT is used directly for dose calculation. In this work, rectum is segmented from CT images and segmented rectum images are useful in the treatment plan.

Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the apphcation and network architecture. There is a design trade-off between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. This paper provides method for clustering and cluster head selection to WSN to improve energy efficiency. It presents a comparison between LEACH and R-LEACH on the basis of the network lifetime. In this paper, we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system hfetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. Further, we modify one of the most prominent wireless sensor networks routing protocol LEACH as R-LEACH by introducing efficient cluster head replacement and inter cluster communication.

Government has taken several methods for documents to scan and stored digitally for future use. Even though the documents are available in the digital format, but it is very difficult to search for a single word or phrase. Traditional optical character recognition techniques (OCR) and other text retrieval methods fail on these document images due to various types of noises. Word spotting will help the users to automatically search for a particular word/phrase in millions of such document images. In this paper we have proposed a word spotting technique for printed Telugu documents. Based on the word spotting technology, a collection of document images is converted into a collection of word images by word segmentation, and a number of profile based features are extracted to represent word images. Correlation and HMM model are applied for comparison of word images. Image to image matching is done by calculating similarities between a query word image and each word image in the collection. © 2016 IEEE.","Correlation; HMM; OCR; Profile based features; Telugu documents","Character recognition; Correlation methods; Data mining; Embedded systems; Image segmentation; Optical character recognition; Signal processing; Calculating similarities; Collection of documents; Document images; Multimedia technologies; Profile based features; Telugu documents; Text retrieval methods; Word segmentation; Information retrieval",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

It provides high efficiency and low data loss in multipath environment hence there is a need for suitable modulation technique. Different modulation techniques in OFDM give different Bit Error Rate (BER) performance and spectral efficiency. Moreover Even after modulation the output of Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) gives large Peak Amplitude Power Ratio (PAPR) which poses a problem in amplifier efficiency and complexity in analog to digital converters. This paper aims at finding a suitable modulation scheme and efficient technique to reduce PAPR in OFDM, based on BER and bandwidth. Algorithms are implemented using MATLAB for different modulation schemes over AWGN, Rayleigh and Rician channel for WLAN application with 52 subcarriers. Random bits are generated such that there are 16 symbols, each symbol having 52 bits. In AWGN for 3db SNR 64-QAM gives BER of 0.23 and to achieve same BER, 64-PSK requires 25db SNR. Rician channel gives better performance compared to Rayleigh, where BER is 0.2965 for Rayleigh and 0.2714 for Rician thereby reducing it by 0.02. Using wavelet transform PAPR is reduced to 62% of that using FFT. © 2016 IEEE.","Bit Error Rate; Inverse Fast Fourier Transform; Linear Block Codes; Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing; Peak Amplitude Power Ratio; Quadrature Amplitude Modulation; Rayleigh channel Introduction; Rician channel","Analog to digital conversion; Bit error rate; Complex networks; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency division multiplexing; Frequency modulation; Inverse problems; Inverse transforms; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mathematical transformations; Modulation; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Radio broadcasting; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; White noise; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Inverse fast Fourier transforms; Linear block code; Power ratio; Rayleigh channel; Rician channels; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

For effective utilization of the total UWB spectrum, Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is a suitable candidate. To achieve the higher data rates and high capacity, both multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and coding techniques are exploited. Hence, a combination of MB-OFDM UWB and Alamouti Space-frequency block coding (SFBC) increases the capacity of UWB systems, achieves better diversity and coding gain and improves overall performance of the system. However, like OFDM, Alamouti coded MB-OFDM UWB signal is also suffering with high PAPR. A Selected mapping (SLM) technique is a one of the popular PAPR reduction technique for MIMO-OFDM systems.

Even when a wireless channel with high channel capacity is known, we still require to find superior techniques to achieve high speed data transmission or high reliability. Multiple antenna techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: diversity techniques and spatial-multiplexing techniques. The diversity techniques intend to receive the same information-bearing signals in the multiple antennas or to transmit them from multiple antennas, in so doing improving the transmission consistency. Diversity techniques are used to mitigate degradation in the error performance due to unstable wireless fading channels, for example, subject to the multipath fading etc. A basic idea of the diversity techniques is to convert Rayleigh fading wireless channel into more stable AWGN-like channel without any catastrophic signal fading. When the spatial-multiplexing Techniques are used, the maximum achievable transmission speed can be the same as the capacity of the MIMO channel; however, when the diversity techniques are used, the achievable transmission speed can be much lower than the capacity of the MIMO channel. Spatially multiplexed MIMO (SM-MIMO) systems can transmit data at a higher speed than MIMO systems using antenna diversity. However, spatial demultiplexing or signal detection at the receiver side is a challenging task for SM MIMO systems. This paper addresses the signal detection technique using maximum likelihood detection for SM MIMO systems. © 2016 IEEE.","Diversity; Maximum likelihood detection; Space time block coding","Antennas; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Embedded systems; Fading channels; Maximum likelihood; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multipath fading; Rayleigh fading; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Space-time block coding (STBC); Speed; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna diversity techniques; Broadband wireless access network; Diversity; High-speed data transmission; Information-bearing signals; Maximum likelihood detection; Multiple antenna techniques; Wireless fading channels; Signal detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

This paper presents a completely automated computer vision based segmentation of fish gills from digital images of fish samples. Post segmentation, a statistical relationship of the segmented gill region is established to design an assessment model for fish freshness identification. The fish gills are segmented using various strategic image processing techniques like contrast enhancement, adaptive intensity threshold and active contour based methods. The model for fish freshness testing is based on the image statistical features which are derived from the gills region of the saturation channel. The variation of the statistical distribution is observed to be decreasing monotonic which is basis for design of the framework for fish quality and freshness identification.

Since many devices are interconnected, there arises concern pertaining to security of data access and control access of devices. This access cannot be given to an unauthorized person, hence security measures are important in M2M. Centre for Development of Telematics (CDOT) developed Tower Monitoring System (TMS) which monitors the power status of telecom towers. Since CDOT developed TMS devices are of different type and capability based on their usage, we need different security implementation for different devices. Some devices may require and support one security method to be implemented whereas other may require other methods. In this paper we have shown how different security measures stated in oneM2M standard, which is a standard body of M2M, can be implemented in CDOT's TMS. Apart from oneM2M security measures we have implemented some other protocols as required in TMS. This approach is an algorithmic solution to the problem of integrating different security measures more so we are here implementing new security protocols that are still not part of any standard of M2M. So this algorithmic solution will not only help CDOT's TMS devices to be part of oneM2M architecture but our integrated algorithmic approach will help oneM2M standard based device to use new security protocols in their network which are still not part of standard. This paper presents an integrated algorithmic way to implement oneM2M recommended transport layer security protocols in CDOT's TMS network.

In a scenario without D2D communication, the base station (referred in LTE-A network as eNB) allocates the RBs to the user equipments (UEs) (i.e., client devices in LTE-A network) based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) reported by them. However, if the RBs are to be reused for D2D communications then the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each device (eNodeB included) sharing those RBs would decrease thereby deteriorating the network performance. To control the SINR violation the network operator may have to set target SINR values for all devices. The focus of this paper is to simultaneously allocate resource blocks for D2D communication and for the uplink (i.e., UE to eNodeB). First, an optimization problem is formulated to perform the scheduling of the RBs. But since the optimization problem is NP hard, an iterative heuristic resource block allocation algorithm (which respect the constraints of the optimization problem) is proposed. The proposed algorithm is compared with a modified version of an existing algorithm.

This increases the overall spectral efficiency because the same Resource Blocks (RBs) are used across cellular UEs (CUEs) (i.e., all UEs connected to BS for both C-Plane and D-plane communication) and D2D links (i.e., where the UEs are connected to BS only for C-plane communication). However, significant interference problems can be caused by D2D communications as the same RBs are being shared. In our work, we address this problem by proposing a novel scheduling algorithm, Efficient Scheduling and Power control Algorithm for D2Ds (ESPAD), which reuses the same RBs and tries to maximize the overall network throughput without affecting the CUEs throughput. ESPAD algorithm also ensures that Signal to Noise plus Interference Ratio (SINR) for each of the D2D links is maintained above a certain predefined threshold. The aforementioned properties of ESPAD algorithm makes sure that the CUEs do not experience very high interference from the D2Ds. It is observed that even when the SINRdrop (i.e., maximum permissible drop in SINR of CUEs) is as high as 10 dB, there is no drastic decrease in CUEs throughput (only 3.78%). We also compare our algorithm against other algorithms and show that D2D throughput improves drastically without undermining CUEs throughput. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Efficiency; Power control; Scheduling algorithms; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Spurious signal noise; Throughput; D2D communications; Efficient scheduling; Interference problems; Novel scheduling algorithms; Overall networks; Signal to noise plus interference ratio; Spatial reuse; Spectral efficiencies; Wireless telecommunication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

As energy consumed by LTE user equipment (UE) is of keen interest to researchers working in wireless networks, they often analyze the energy consumed by a UE when running network simulations. Thus, there is a stringent need for the underlying simulator to have an energy consumption model, but NS-3 currently does not have a LTE UE energy expenditure module. In literature, the LTE UE energy expenditure is profiled and modeled for a commercial UE. A corresponding implementation of the same is needed in NS-3. In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of LTE UE energy model in NS-3 and then validate it by running various experiments. Our implementation of LTE UE energy consumption model yields the expected power profile in our experiments with varying scheduling of resources to UEs.

The antenna realizes complete azimuthal beam scanning with a maximum elevation angle of 34°. This antenna consists of a central driven element and four hexagonal slotted tunable parasitic patches placed on each side of the driven element. The effective electrical size of the parasitic element is changed with respect to the driven element, by varying the capacitance of varactor diodes loaded in the hexagonal slot. The reflector and director properties of the tunable parasitic elements are used to tilt the main beam of antenna away from the broadside direction. The antenna achieves continuous beam scanning from θ = 0° to 34° for π = 45°, 90°, 135°, 225°, 270° and 315° planes. The advantage of the antenna is that the design is simple and it maintains a common impedance bandwidth from 2.42-2.47 GHz in all configurations.

In HetNet, enabling Carrier Aggregation (CA) usually results in severe downlink interference at small cells from macro cell because of high powered transmissions from macro cell on over-lapping component carriers (co-channels). The intensity of downlink interference is much more profound in HetNet enabled with CA than compared with a single carrier HetNet and ultimately affects the Quality of Service (QoS) of users connected to small cells. Some frequency domain solutions like cross carrier scheduling, soft frequency reuse, and downlink power control have been proposed so far, but they do not provide complete orthogonal transmissions among macro and small cells, leading to adjacent channel interference. Also, a few time domain approaches like Almost Blank Subframe (ABS), dynamic ABS have been proposed in the literature. However, the resource utilization of cells decreases due to high number of ABS assignments in the dense deployment, which also results in low user throughput. In this paper, we propose a combined time domain and frequency domain novel idea for downlink interference control, which is via adaptive Discontinuous Reception (DRX) settings through Multi-Objective optimizations and an optimal carrier allocation scheme, respectively. The proposed idea mitigates the downlink co-channel interference by enabling intermittent data reception at the User Equipment (UE) through adaptive DRX settings, also it utilizes an effective carrier allocation scheme such that users are always allocated to carriers with least interference. The analytical model and simulation results reveal that the proposed idea achieves average gain of 3.5 times w.r.t cell throughput when compared with well-known downlink interference mitigation schemes. © 2016 IEEE.","Carrier Aggregation; Downlink interference control; HetNet; LTE-Advanced; Multi-objective optimization; QoS","4G mobile communication systems; Cells; Cochannel interference; Cytology; Frequency domain analysis; Heterogeneous networks; Interference suppression; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multiobjective optimization; Power control; Quality of service; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adjacent channel interference; Carrier aggregations; Discontinuous receptions; Downlink interferences; Downlink power control; Heterogeneous Network (HetNet); HetNet; Lte- advanced; Adaptive control systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In HetNets, base station (BS) density around a particular user is more compared to the traditional cellular network, resulting in frequent handoffs for a better quality of service. However, if the mobility management is not efficient, there is always a high probability of handover failures, unnecessary handoffs and call drops. The accurate estimation of the velocity of mobile users is one of the most challenging task in mobility management. The proposed velocity estimation strategy is based on handoff count which occurs during a predefined time span. Here we model densely deployed BSs using random waypoint process (RWP) and analyse the statistics of handover count as a function of velocity, BS density, and time span. Using these statistics we first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and later we determine a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is an asymptotic unbiased estimator. We validate our approach by simulation which show the tight closeness of MLE asymptotic variance with CRLB.

Their bidding process usually follows an opportunity cost approach that attempts to trade off the investments in network infrastructure against the acquisition of bigger spectrum blocks in cost-effective bands. To help them understand better the effectiveness of the newly opened 700 MHz band in India, this paper compares the overall financial implications of deploying 4G LTE services on 700 MHz band with those on 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands over a 20-year horizon across 22 telecom circles. We use a combination of Okumara-Hata/Cost-231 model, cell-dimensioning approach and Bass model based adoption forecasts to determine coverage, capacity, and number of subscribers, respectively. After estimating the TCO and the revenue figures for all the three bands, we apply the discounted cash flow method to analyze their comparative profitability. Our results show that, in addition to giving better cellular coverage, 700 MHz is the most cost-effective band, its TCO being approximately one-fourth of that of 1800 MHz band, and one-sixth of that of 2100 MHz band. Moreover, the circle-wise profitability of 700 MHz is the highest amongst all the three bands, with maximum profitability being in Metro circles, followed by Category C circles. Interestingly, the potential for a better profitability in Category C circles, which are crucial to ensure the mandated last-mile coverage for rural villages, further increases the attractiveness of 700 MHz band. We also find that the smaller circles in Category B hold out better promises for profitability, compared to the larger circles in Category A. Hence, overall there is a genuine need for a consolidated approach in spectrum acquisition by an incumbent operator to reap synergistic benefit in aggregate profitability. © 2017 IEEE.","4G; Cellular mobile; Discounted Cash Flow (DCF); LTE; Spectrum; Techno-economic assessment; Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Investments; Mergers and acquisitions; Profitability; Cellular mobile; Discounted cash flow; Spectrum; Techno-economic assessment; Total cost of ownership; Wireless telecommunication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

One of the most important factors that diminish the quality of viewing experience of delivered videos is frequent client side rebuffering events. This paper proposes a buffer-aware downlink scheduling framework (called BA-TLS) for streaming video applications. The problem of scheduling a set of video streams over LTE has first been formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. It has been shown that a conventional dynamic programming solution for the ILP imposes prohibitive online overheads. Then, by utilizing analytical properties of the problem, a genetic algorithm based fast and efficient radio resource allocation heuristic has been implemented over the proposed framework.

The hierarchical framework uses two known binary classifiers SVM and Decision tree at each level which is based on one-Against-All approach. The proposed system assumes no a priori knowledge about signal properties like frequency, phase or symbol rate. The performance of the classifiers is compared based upon the accuracy, training time and classification time needed for each stage of the framework.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirement. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. This paper presents pentagon shape patch antenna with probe feed for three different dimensions.

This paper proposes a method for the detection and classification of mass abnormalities in digital mammogram images using multi SVM classifier. The goal of this research is to increase the diagnostic accuracy of image processing and optimum classification between malignant and benign abnormalities in mass region which reduces the misclassification of breast images. Malignant and benign abnormalities are detected from the segmented images using region based segmentation, which correspond to the Regions of Interest (ROIs) or abnormal regions. Texture based features are extracted from the ROI samples using Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrices (GLCMs). For the purpose of classification between malignant and benign samples, the optimum subset of texture features are classified using a Multi-Support Vector Machine (SVM).

It comprises of many different types of imaging methods likes CT scans, X-Ray and MRI. These techniques allow us to identify even the smallest abnormalities in the human body. The primary goal of medical imaging is to extract meaningful and accurate information from these images with the least error possible. Out of the various types of medical imaging processes available to us, MRI is the most reliable and safe. It does not involve exposing the body to any sorts of harmful radiation. This MRI can then be processed, and the tumor can be segmented. Tumor Segmentation includes the use of several different techniques. The whole process of detecting brain tumor from an MRI can be classified into four different categories: Pre-Processing, Segmentation, Optimization and Feature Extraction.

Currently we are developing a Small Organ Imaging Gamma Camera (SOIGC) for imaging small organs with higher spatial and energy resolution. We present here a novel 'SoC' based real-time medical image processing tool for evaluation and quantification of Thyroid Uptake Ratio derived from Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).The Thyroid Uptake Ratio is a diagnostic index used extensively to assess Thyroid's hormonal activity obtained by quantifying the intensity of the segmented SPECT images which are conventionally done on expensive propriety tools. In contrast to these, our lower cost SoC tool based on DSP architecture offers a higher speed image segmentation process with co-relating performance. Thus, it also eliminates the need for higher computing resources on the host machine by using a Hardware accelerator called 'Pipeline Vision Processor' of an optimized Dual Core Digital Signal Processor. This architecture offers a high performance enhanced infrastructure with large on-chip memory and reduces the overall bandwidth requirement leading to accelerated imaging. We have cross-validated the performance of this tool by evaluating 27 medical case studies with thyroid medical history. As compared to diagnosis by propriety SIEMENS software or segmentation tools based on MATLAB, our hardware accelerated approach has shown a drastic reduction of computational time of about 250% with superior correlation. This SoC tool can be extended and realized for various other Medical Imaging procedures like Kidney's Glomerular Filtration Rate and Myocardial Perfusion studies of Heart. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital Signal Processing (DSP); Medical Imaging; Pipelined Vision Processor (PVP); System on Chip (SoC)","Biomedical equipment; Computer hardware; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Hardware; Image processing; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Pipeline processing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; Single photon emission computed tomography; System-on-chip; Bandwidth requirement; Computational resources; Digital signal processing (DSP); Glomerular filtration rate; Hardware accelerators; Image segmentation process; System on chips (SoC); Vision processor; Integrated circuit design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036622,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Recent days lower back pain in human being increases and so the lumber spine pathology detection becomes a predominant research area in Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system. In the process of lumbar spine pathology detection, the segmentation of the Intervertebral Disc (IVD) is the major step as it identifies the IVDs or the boundaries of the IVDs either normal or abnormal in images. When the axial or the sagittal View of lumbar spine MR image is given as input, this proposed work segments the IVD in both the axial and sagittal views. The segmentation of IVD is a four stage process. First, Expectation-Maximization (EM) segmentation is performed on the MR Image. EM segmentation yields an advantage over K-means with the case of the size of clustering. The second stage is to carry out the morphological operators and third, apply edge detection method and obtain the edges. The final stage is to remove unwanted objects from the obtained output image. If this proposed segmentation is utilized as part of the CAD, the experts will be benefited for localizing the IVD and to diagnose the IVD disease. © 2017 IEEE.","Computer Aided Diagnosis; EM segmentation; Intervertebral Disc; Lower back pain.

Most cases of breast cancer can be prevented through screening programs aimed at detecting abnormal tissue. So, early detection and diagnosis is the best way to cure breast cancer to decrease the mortality rate. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system provides an alternative tool to the radiologist for the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. In this paper, an automated CAD system is proposed to classify the breast tissues as normal or abnormal. Artifacts are removed using ROI extraction process and noise has been removed by the 2D median filter. Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm is used to improve the appearance of the image. The texture features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) of the region of interest (ROI) of a mammogram. The standard Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database images are considered for the evaluation. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are used as classifiers. For each classifier, the performance factor such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are computed. It is observed that the proposed scheme with 3NN classifier outperforms SVM and ANN by giving 95% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity to classify mammogram images as normal or abnormal. © 2016 IEEE.","3NN classifier; Confusion Matrix; GLCM; Mammogram; ROI","Diseases; Image segmentation; Mammography; Median filters; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Tissue; X ray screens; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Confusion matrices; Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE); GLCM; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Mammogram; The region of interest (ROI); Computer aided diagnosis",,"Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034116,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Satellite images are used in many applications such as geosciences studies, astronomy, and geographical information systems. Two most important quality factors of images are contrast and resolution, here this technique decomposes the input filtered image into the four frequency sub-bands by using DWT and then the high frequency subband images and input image have been interpolated along with this the technique also estimates the singular value matrix of the low-low sub band of histogram equalized image and input filtered image then normalize both singular value matrices to obtain brightness enhanced image. In, order to get the new image of better contrast and resolution all these subbands are combined using inverse DWT. The following procedure is done with different types of noises and different types of filters then they are compared with conventional image equalization techniques such as general histogram equalization (GHE), local histogram equalization (LHE) and also from state-of-The-Art technique which is singular value equalization (SVE) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the experimental results show the supremacy of the proposed method over conventional and state-of-Art techniques. © 2016 IEEE.","Bicubic interpolation; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Non local mean filter (NLM); Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR); Singular value decomposition (SVD)","Discrete wavelet transforms; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image compression; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Bicubic interpolation; Contrast Enhancement; Frequency sub band; Histogram equalizations; Local histogram equalizations; Non-local mean filters; Peak signal to noise ratio; State-of-the-art techniques; Singular value decomposition",,"Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034116,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The treatment for ischemic heart disease is a tough nut to crack as it calls for a widened comprehension and skill. One of the widely used conventional approaches to figure out ischemic heart ailment is through a doctor's assessment. Rather the disease can also be found out through a range of health checkups that includes Heart Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) test, Stress Test, Electrocardiogram (ECG), etc. To arrive at an enhanced and useful output, original techniques are recommended, and the suggested methods are Sobel Edge Detection(SED) and Support Vector Machine(SVM).The aforementioned method paves the way for an enhanced yield given identifying heart disease. Some of the phases such as pre-processing involved are suppression of image quality to seek advancement in the influenced area and Segmentation inside the Sobel Edge Detection in the boundaries of the area of concentration. The signs of the pixel differences are changed over by LBP (Local Binary Pattern) in the midst of a pixel and its abutting pixels to a twofold code. Local Binary Pattern has become an important and adored concept due to its user-friendliness and toughness to brightening varieties, responsiveness to noise restricting its act.

Till now several approaches to same problem have been measured in existing reconstruction algorithms. They provide a compromise between restoration capabilities and required computational time. In an effort to push the limits for this compromise, we consider a smoothed l0 norm (SL0) algorithm in a noiseless setup. In this paper, we proposed modified version of SL0 algorithm for modern wireless communication system. We argue that using a set of meticulously chosen parameters in our proposed modified SL0 algorithm may result in considerably good restoration capabilities in terms of phase transition while required less computational time as existing SL0 algorithms.

It is considered as one of the most promising 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced technologies for improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of Proximity-based Services (ProSe). However, due to interference posed by the D2D transmitters to the primary cellular users, intelligent resource allocation techniques need to be incorporated for the betterment of the overall system. Overlay D2D communication avoids the interference between cellular and D2D users by dedicating resources for D2D users. With this approach, efficient use of the dedicated Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) among D2D users is still a concern. To handle the issue of optimum spectral efficiency, efficient allocation of spectrum resources is essential among D2D users. For the first time, we address this problem and propose a PRB allocation scheme that maximizes the PRB utilization among D2D users. The proposed scheme spreads the PRB requirement of a D2D pair over multiple PRBs while reducing the transmit power over each PRB, thereby reducing the overall interference and improving the spectral efficiency of the network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our scheme does better than the conventional PRB allocation scheme (of assigning PRBs based on their data rate demand), by increasing the overall throughput and energy efficiency of the network. To analytically evaluate the proposed PRB allocation scheme, we present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the coverage and average rate of the network, and conclude that the link SINR of the D2D pairs is actually improved on employing our proposed scheme which results in high coverage and overall rate of the system. Finally, we propose a Q-Learning algorithm that learns the optimum number of PRBs to dedicate for overlay D2D communication based on the PRB demand of the cellular and D2D users. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm efficiently allocates PRBs to the D2D pairs when compared to the conventional static scheme of dedicating fixed number of PRBs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular network; Channel assignment; Energy efficiency; Overlay D2D communication; Power control; Q-Learning; Stochastic geometry","Geometry; Learning algorithms; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Power control; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; Channel Assignment; D2D communications; Q-learning; Stochastic geometry; Energy efficiency","Swain, S.N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: siba@cse.iitm.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

Automated multiple human detection is one of the most active research fields of computer vision applications. It provides useful information for crowd monitoring and traffic controlling for human safety in public places. The conventional Gaussian mixture model, that has a fixed K values, is not enough for dynamically varying background and further foreground detection is a time consuming process. The automated multiple human detection algorithms are needed to deal with complex background and illumination change conditions of crowd scene. In this paper, an automated multiple human detection method using hybrid adaptive Gaussian mixture model is proposed to handle efficiently the complex background and illumination changes. The proposed hybrid algorithm utilizes spatiotemporal features, adaptive learning control, adaptively changing weights and an adaptive selection with number of K Gaussian components per pixel to withstand in complex background and different lighting conditions. The experimental results and performance measures demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method performs well for crowd scene.

The sensor nodes are generally tiny and made of irreplaceable power source and limited capacity for computing, communication, and storage. The power constraint necessitates that the WSN routing protocols conserve energy as critical factor to maximize the network lifetime. Cluster-based approaches are popularly used for its energy efficiency where some nodes designated as Cluster Heads (CHs) organize WSNs for data aggregation and energy saving. The CH is responsible for gathering data from the cluster nodes and conveying it to the base station due to which higher energy drain occurs at CH leading to uneven network degradation. Thus, the selection of CH is critical for improving the WSN performance and lifetime.

This paper discusses some of the biasing conditions under which the signal to noise ratio of the licensed user at two sensing nodes differ, so one of the nodes at random (out of two) facilitate better sensing results than the other. Under this situation, the conventional CR may not always ensure a better sensing performance which can degrade its achievable throughput. To avoid such a situation, we propose an interference aware CR system which allows sensing to be performed at both the sides (transmitter and receiver) and considers a side with the best sensing results.

Hence, the proposed MLCMRF is a combination of spatial distribution of color, temporal color coherence and edge maps in the temporal frames. The use of such an edge preserving model helps in enhancing the object boundary in spatial segmentation and hence can detect moving objects with less effect of silhouette. A difference between the frames is used to generate the CDM and is subsequently updated with the previous frame video object plane (VOP) and the spatial segmentation of the consecutive frames, to detect the moving objects from the target image frames.

These types of networks have a wide range of applications including habitat monitoring, health monitoring, data acquisition in hazardous environmental conditions and military operations. Sensor nodes are resource constrained having limited communication range, battery and processing power. Sensor nodes are prone to failure and can be also physically captured by an adversary. One of the main concerns in WSNs is to provide security, especially in the cases where they are deployed for military applications and monitoring. Further, WSNs are prone to various attacks such as wormhole, sinkhole and blackhole attacks. A blackhole attack is a kind of denial of service attack, which is very difficult to detect and defend and such blackhole attack, if happens, affects the entire performance of the network. In addition, it causes high end-to-end delay and less throughput with less packet delivery ratio. The situation can be worst if multiple blackhole attacker nodes present in the network. As a result, detection and prevention of the blackhole attack becomes crucial in WSNs. In this paper, we aim to propose a new efficient group-based technique for the detection and prevention of multiple blackhole attacker nodes in WSNs. In our approach, the entire WSN is divided into several clusters and each cluster has a powerful high-end sensor node (called a cluster head), which is responsible for the detection of blackhole attacker nodes, if present, in that cluster. The proposed scheme achieves about 90 % detection rate and 3.75 % false positive rate, which are significantly better than the existing related schemes. Furthermore, our scheme is efficient and thus, it is very appropriate for practical applications in WSNs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Blackhole attacks; Detection and prevention; Hierarchical wireless sensor networks; NS2; Security","Computer crime; Data acquisition; Denial-of-service attack; Military applications; Military operations; Network security; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Blackhole attacks; Environmental conditions; Hierarchical wireless sensor networks; Limited communication range; Packet delivery ratio; Security; Wireless communication technology; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Das, A.K.; Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: iitkgp.akdas@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986316061

In this approach, instead of extracting the features of the whole query image, features of the objects of interest are extracted. For this, some morphological operations are performed on the image. First, background subtraction is performed to reduce the effect of background intensities, then segmentation is performed and the regions are extracted. To minimize the number of comparisons in image retrieval process, the image is categorized into texture and non texture regions. This reduces the retrieval time by comparing the ROI on the basis of its category. During the feature extraction process, a flag is set to indicate the category of the image i.e. texture image or non-texture (natural) image. Feature vector of an image is stored along with respective objects within the image. Tetrolet transform is used to retrieve the texture features for the texture regions while moment invariants and edge features are used for non-texture regions. The performance and efficiency of the proposed system is tested on COREL and CIFAR databases.

As the primary CH bandwidth differ from the SU and in the case, the SU bandwidth is lower to PU, accommodation of more than one secondary CH into primary is possible. To utilize this facility, bandwidth flexibility is incorporated in the intelligent spectrum allocation. The intelligent spectrum allocation techniques are compared with the sequence based method of spectrum allocation and priority based allocation. The quality measures utilized for comparison are service rate, average packet loss and average delay. On these measures intelligent dynamic bandwidth flexible spectrum allocation method is found to be better, compared to other three methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bandwidth flexibility; Cognitive radio; Fuzzy; Intelligent allocation; Priority; Round robin; Spectrum allocation","Bandwidth; Frequency bands; Fuzzy inference; Routers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Fuzzy; Intelligent allocation; Priority; Round Robin; Spectrum allocation; Cognitive radio","Veeramakali, T.; Faculty of I&C, Adhiparasakthi Engineering CollegeIndia; email: umaprabhu81@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018492313

The current standing spectrum allocation policy is unable to put up the demands of wireless communication. This leads to self-motivated spectrum allocation policy. Cognitive radio (CR) technology is a radiant way to increase spectrum utilization by identifying unused and under-utilized spectrum in vigorously changing environments. Spectrum sensing is a one of the input technique of cognitive radio which detects the existence of primary user in licensed frequency band using self-motivated spectrum allocation policies to use unoccupied spectrum. Spectrum sensing is generally based on energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection. Energy detection is a basic spectrum sensing technique but becomes bleak at a low signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The fundamental cyclostationary feature detection based on cyclic spectrum estimation can actively detect feeble signals from primary users with a cost of maximum complexity on implementation. The objective of this work is to implement precious spectrum-sensing method in field programmable gate array with pragmatic complexity for CR. Particularly, The proposed new spectrum-sensing method called the adaptive absolute-self-coherent-restoral algorithm has been introduced. The complexity of the consequential algorithm is better than the prior self-coherent-restoral (SCORE) algorithm, such as adaptive least-SCORE (ALS), adaptive cross-SCORE (ACS). Their performance for spectrum sensing is analytically appraised and compared in detail. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cognitive radio (CR); Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Spectrum sensing","Feature extraction; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency bands; Logic gates; Radio systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrum analysis; Timing jitter; Wireless telecommunication systems; Changing environment; Cognitive radio technologies; Cyclostationary feature detection; Electromagnetic spectra; Signal-to-interference and noise ratios; Spectrum sensing; Spectrum sensing techniques; Wireless communications; Cognitive radio","Karthikeyan, C.S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Kamaraj College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: crs_karthik@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988934907

Existing methods for RP and RR measurement fall into one of the three categories - 1) estimation through nasal air flow measurement, 2) estimation from video-based remote photoplethysmography, and 2) estimation by measurement of motion induced by respiration using motion detectors. However, these methods require specialized sensors, are computationally expensive, and/or critically depend on selection of a region of interest (ROI) for processing. In this paper, a general framework is described for estimating a periodic signal driving noisy linear time-invariant (LTI) channels connected in parallel with unknown dynamics. The method is then applied to derive a computationally inexpensive method for estimating RP using two-dimensional cameras that does not critically depend on ROI. Specifically, RP is estimated by imaging changes in the reflected light caused by respiration-induced motion. Each spatial location in the field of view of the camera is modeled as a noise-corrupted LTI measurement channel with unknown system dynamics, driven by a single generating respiratory signal. Estimation of RP is cast as a blind deconvolution problem and is solved through a method comprising subspace projection and statistical aggregation. Experiments are carried out on 31 healthy human subjects by generating multiple RPs and comparing the proposed estimates with simultaneously acquired ground truth from an impedance pneumograph device. The proposed estimator agrees well with the ground truth in terms of correlation measures, despite variability in clothing pattern, camera angle, and ROI. © 2017 IEEE.","blind deconvolution; ensemble aggregation; Non-contact bio-signal monitoring; respiratory rate measurement; robust respiratory pattern estimation","Cameras; Convolution; Estimation; Image segmentation; Respirators; Biosignals; Blind deconvolution; Correlation measures; Linear time-invariant channels; Measurement channels; Multiple applications; Respiratory pattern; Respiratory rate; Flow measurement","Prathosh, A.P.; Xerox Research Center India, Conduent Labs IndiaIndia; email: prathoshap@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1053587X,,ITPRE,,"English","IEEE Trans Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018493994

However, due to its directional property, a circular distribution is required to characterize the hue component. In this article, we propose a mixture of bi-variate circular–linear distributions, for modelling hue and chroma information. The proposed model incorporates a joint distribution of a circular and a linear variable by means of circular copula and offers a flexible architecture that deals with heterogeneous margins for different mixture components. We apply this model for psoriatic plaque segmentation in skin images, using the hue and the chroma information. We observe that the chroma exhibits a heterogeneous distribution in a skin image. Moreover, the joint distribution of hue and chroma possesses multi-modal characteristics. Our model is suitable to perform segmentation under such circumstances. After segmentation, we perform automatic plaque localization by means of a statistical model that exploits hue information of the segmented regions. We conduct the experiments on a set of 75 psoriasis skin images. Both segmentation and localization performances are evaluated with respect to a number of commonly used criteria. The experimental results show that the proposed segmentation model outperforms several competing supervised and unsupervised methods in detecting psoriatic plaque regions in skin images. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular–linear data; Expectation maximization (EM); Mixture model; Psoriasis; Psoriatic plaque; Segmentation","Dermatology; Maximum principle; Mixtures; Circular-linear data; Expectation Maximization; Mixture model; Psoriasis; Psoriatic plaques; Image segmentation","Pal, A.; CVPR Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia",,"Elsevier Ltd",00313203,,PTNRA,,"English","Pattern Recogn.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009789186

To achieve this end we use the non-extensive entropy with Gaussian gain as the regularity index, computed locally from texture patches through a sliding window approach. The optimum window size is determined by modeling the entropy values by a two-mode Gaussian mixture model and checking for the minimum entropy of the mode-probabilities. The outlier entropy values corresponding to defective areas are defined as those that exceed thrice the standard deviation, as is the norm in statistics. The result is automatic defect detection with no manual intervention. Empirical results on defective texture images from the Brodatz database provide accurate localization of the defect as compared to Chetverikov and Hanbury's maximal regularity method, which requires manual setting of threshold parameters for each type of texture despite of being a benchmark for texture defect detection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Gaussian mixture model; Non-extensive entropy with Gaussian gain; Sliding window approach; Texture defects; Texture regularity","Communication channels (information theory); Entropy; Gaussian distribution; Automatic defect detections; Gaussian gain; Gaussian Mixture Model; Manual intervention; Nonextensive entropy; Sliding Window; Texture defect detection; Threshold parameters; Defects; Article; automated pattern recognition; automatic texture defect detection; classifier; entropy; Gaussian mixture entropy modeling; image processing; image segmentation; textile","Susan, S.email: seba_406@yahoo.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013156571

DAC-MSS builds a multi-category classifier model organized in the form of a tree of binary classifiers. The tree consists of several TW-LKSC classifiers which use a training set consisting of few labeled samples and rest unlabeled samples to generate a pair of hyperplanes, by solving a system of linear equations. The propagation of labels to unlabeled patterns is achieved through localized kernel spectral clustering (LKSC) which is the core clustering model embedded in TW-LKSC. TW-LKSC also employs cluster prototype to localize the generation of hyperplanes and prevents them from extending infinitely. The strength of DAC-MSS is its better classification accuracy and improved learning time, due to divide and conquer approach, as compared to one-against-all based semi-supervised classification algorithms. This is proved experimentally for benchmark UCI datasets.

For the reliable data upload and download, TCP can be used for vehicular networks. However, TCP requires the connection initialization using three-way handshaking for the data exchange between two end systems over the Internet. Thus, the efficient operation of TCP is important for data services in the vehicular networks. This paper proposes a method of TCP Context Migration Scheme (TOMS) for the enhancement of data services in vehicular networks. TOMS provides vehicles with proactive TCP connection initialization using a moving TCP proxy as a cluster head, which will have the Internet connectivity with a Road-Side Unit (RSU). A cluster member can initiate its TCP connection toward its corresponding TCP end-system (e.g., server and peer) via the TCP proxy within its cluster. The TCP proxy performs the TCP connection set-up for the sake of other cluster member vehicles and acknowledges the received TCP segments toward these vehicles. When the TCP proxy moves out of the communication range of the RSU, it transfers the TCP contexts of other vehicles to another vehicle, which will play the role of a TCP proxy through the proposed TCP context migration scheme. Also, the RSU works as a fixed TCP proxy for handling the acknowledgement of TCP segments and TCP timer handling (e.g., persist timer and keepalive timer) when there happens the disconnection between the moving proxy and the RSU. Thus, it is shown that our TOMS outperforms the legacy TCP in vehicular networks. © 2017 IEEE.","Cooperative TCP; IPv6; VANET; Vehicular networks; Vehicular TCP","Electronic data interchange; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cooperative TCP; IPv6; VANET; Vehicular networks; Vehicular TCP; Transmission control protocol","Jeong, J.; Department of DMC Engineering, Sungkyunkwan UniversitySouth Korea; email: jjs9915@skku.edu","Enokido T.Takizawa M.Lin C.-Y.Hsu H.-H.Barolli L.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062300,,,"English","Proc.

The proposed antenna is fabricated on a RT/duroid 5880 substrate with a dielectric constant (ϵr) of 2.2 and thickness (h) of 0.787mm. Slots are etched on one side of the substrate, while the microstrip feed network is printed on the other side.

The speaker specific characteristics of the speech signal are reflected at different levels such as the shape of the vocal tract, shape of the glottal excitation and long term prosody. The shape of the vocal tract is represented by Line Spectral Frequency (LSF) and the shape of glottal excitation by Linear Predictive (LP) residuals. In this paper, the fourth level wavelet packet transform is applied to LP-residual to generate the sixteen sub-bands. This approach not only reduces the computational complexity but also presents a genuine transformation model over state of the art statistical prediction methods. In voice conversion, the alignment is an essential process which aligns the features of the source and target speakers. In this paper, the Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) based warping path is proposed to align the LSF and LP-residual sub-bands using proposed constant source and constant target alignment. The conventional alignment technique is compared with two proposed approaches namely, constant source and constant target. Analysis shows that, constant source alignment using MFCC warping path performs slightly better than the constant target alignment and the state-of-the-art alignment approach. Generalized mapping models are developed for each sub-band using Radial Basis Function neural network (RBF) and are compared with Gaussian Mixture mapping model (GMM) and residual selection approach.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is an excellent choice for fourth generation (4G). 4G modulation methods suffer from the problem of high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Side band leakage is another problem in OFDM. Our current 4G systems rely on the OFDM waveform, which is not capable of supporting the diverse applications 5G will offer. The traffic generated by 5G is expected to have very different characteristics and requirements when compared to current wireless technology. As result other multiple access schemes are being investigated. The way to overcome the known limitations of OFDM is UFMC technique. This paper discusses PAPR and Bit Error Rate (BER) of UFMC system for various mapping schemes. Mat lab simulations show that BER values for UFMC are increasing with increase in number of bits per subcarrier. BER of UFMC system is less for 4QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) mapping method when compared to the other mapping methods but PAPR of UFMC is high when compared with OFDM. PAPR for UFMC is 8.237 and for OFDM it is 8.843 at SNR=5dB when 16QAM Mapping is used. For all other mapping methods PAPR of UFMC system is high compared to PAPR of OFDM. Therefore as a compromise between BER and PAPR of UFMC system, 16QAM mapping method is preferable for UFMC system. © 2016 IEEE.","BER; OFDM; PAPR; QAM; UFMC","5G mobile communication systems; Artificial intelligence; Bit error rate; Mapping; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Fourth generation (4G); Modulation techniques; Multiple access scheme; PAPR; Peak to average power ratio; UFMC; Wireless communication system; Wireless technologies; Modulation",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Further, hardware network appliances are expensive to procure and upgrade, and are difficult to adapt and program for new services. These trends have recently spurred several efforts to redesign various components of mobile networks, including the LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) are two popular emerging networking paradigms that aim to increase network flexibility and scalability, while reducing the overall cost. With SDN, the control and data planes of the packet core can be separated, enabling cheaper packet gateways in the data plane, and an intelligent core network controller to handle the signaling and management functions. With NFV, the various hardware components that comprise the packet core can be virtualized and run as software on a cloud, enabling benefits such as elastic scaling and quick innovation. While several proposals exist to use SDN and NFV to redesign the EPC, there is no common framework to compare the new designs on various performance metrics. This paper presents the design and evaluation of two open-source implementations of the LTE EPC, one based on SDN principles and the other based on NFV, and presents a performance comparison of the two approaches. Experiments with our prototype show that an NFV-based implementation is better suited for networks with high signaling traffic, because handling the communication with the SDN controller quickly becomes the bottleneck at the switches in the SDN-based EPC. On the other hand, an SDN-based design of the EPC is better suited for networks with high data plane traffic, because SDN switches are often more optimized for packet forwarding than virtualized software appliances. We believe that our framework can be used to develop and compare several such design alternatives, and can serve as a guide for future redesigns of mobile data packet core networks. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Hardware; Information management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Open source software; Software defined networking; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Design and evaluations; Hardware components; Management functions; Mobile network operators; Open source implementation; Performance comparison; Performance metrics; Software defined networking (SDN); Network function virtualization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509009336,,,"English","IEEE Conf.

Dielectric Resonator Structures (DRS) combined with metallic structures reduce the antenna size at low frequency bands of operation. In this paper, a monopole antenna is designed to operate at 5.5 GHz and the antenna performance is identically shifted to 3.6 GHz by loading a cylindrical shape dielectric resonator structure over the monopole antenna. The DRS provides wider impedance bandwidth at lower resonant frequency with negligible dielectric losses. The dielectric resonating structure is designed using Bakelite with the dielectric constant (ϵr) of 4.8. The simulated monopole antenna with and without DRS is studied for its performance measures. The antenna performance is evaluated through fabrication of the DRS and monopole antenna. Dual band operation of the monopole antenna operating at 5.5 GHz and 3.6 GHz is achieved with the help of DRS.

The detection is based on finding abnormalities, such as exudates and red lesions, and the grading is based on the location of these abnormalities in the image referred with its distance from the macula. Accordingly the entire image has been divided into regions and occurrence of abnormalities in these regions indicates the severity of the disease.

One of the causes for this achievement is building global computer networks. The technological growth in the field of wireless technologies provides communication between mobile users. Any invention is to say success, only if it is useful in a meaningful manner. Wireless technology is the one that will help an emergency needy like in any natural disaster, emergency rescue operations, military battle-field etc. With the advent of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks, an immediate self-configuring network can be created. Being an open network, security is the main concern for MANETs. In such situations to protect the confidentiality of the message to be transmitted, cryptography is the one of the solution. The process of converting the original data into a secret form is known as cryptography. It hides the actual information and sends the encrypted message. At the destination end, the message can be recovered by using decryption. Here we are proposing a new encryption technique named as Letter-Shape Encryption. This method exchanges different shapes for letters in a message to be transmitted.

It plays a major role in the field of biomedical applications as it is widely used by the radiologists to segment the medical images input into meaningful regions. In recent years, various brain tumour detection techniques are presented in the literature. The entire segmentation process of our proposed work comprises three phases: threshold generation with dynamic modified region growing phase, texture feature generation phase and region merging phase. by dynamically changing two thresholds in the modified region growing approach, the first phase of the given input image can be performed as dynamic modified region growing process, in which the optimisation algorithm, firefly algorithm help to optimise the two thresholds in modified region growing. After obtaining the region growth segmented image using modified region growing, the edges can be detected with edge detection algorithm. In the second phase, the texture feature can be extracted using entropy-based operation from the input image. In region merging phase, the results obtained from the texture feature-generation phase are combined with the results of dynamic modified region growing phase and similar regions are merged using a distance comparison between regions. After identifying the abnormal tissues, the classification can be done by hybrid kernel-based SVM (Support Vector Machine). The performance analysis of the proposed method will be carried by K-cross fold validation method.

Stream ciphers constitute a popular choice for ensuring security of data communications in such applications. To keep the cost, complexity and energy expenditure in the implementation of such stream cipher algorithms low, the short duration of the wireless communication sessions are often exploited by using a lightweight cryptographic (LWC) algorithm. Such an LWC algorithm will provide the desired security during the short session at the required speed, and a new key will be used for the next session so that an adversary would not have enough time to decipher the key of any session. In this paper, we propose a technique based on generating stream of random keys from streaming twitter data. The sequence of random keys generated by the proposed tweet-based key generation (TBKG) algorithm has been tested by the NIST statistical test suite for randomness. The test results show that TBKG algorithm passes all the fifteen tests for randomness. Also, the period of the key values is quite high, thus making it suitable for use over short sessions involving communication of 350 MB data through the wireless network. The unpredictability of the generated random key values is governed by the unpredictable nature of the tweets from thousands of individuals. The algorithm is very simple to implement with low computational and energy overhead. © 2017 IEEE.","Internet of Things; Key generation; Lightweight cryptography; Mobile transactions; Stream cipher; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks","Cryptography; Random processes; Security of data; Social networking (online); Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Key generation; Light-weight cryptography; Mobile transaction; Stream Ciphers; Wireless communications; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043385,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Traditionally, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) has been used to produce the orthogonal sub-carriers. However, Discrete Wavelets Transformation (DWT) has been used to produce the orthogonal and Bi-orthogonal sub-carriers.

The BER performance plots of the system affected by errors as a function of phase noise 3-dB bandwidth on AWGN & multipath channels was obtained through simulations.

Although, wireless sensor network is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication, we find very less development of real time applications using the sensor networks. The main reason for this is the design of the motes to be deployed in the sensor field according to the requirement of application is difficult job and expensive in terms of investment of money. Moreover, the replacement of the batteries or repairing of the devices becomes a very challenging task as the human intervention in the deployment areas is next to impossible. Hence assurance of long lived sensor nodes and prolonged network life time can be impacted by inducing adequate amount of sleep scheduling to the nodes. This paper presents a communication protocol based on optimal back-off sleep time to give a right amount of sleeping to the sensing devices in the monitoring area due to which energy efficient coverage can be achieved. The advantage of the design is that based on the unused battery, randomly the sleep duration is calculated and given to the probing node by the active node. Hence, full utilization of the active node till it dies is ensured. The life of an individual node thus increases since the time of activity of it is smartly scheduled. The blacklisting of nodes like to be faulty or fail helps to overcome problem of node failure. The simulation of the protocol, analysis of the results and further scope of the development of the proposed design is discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient performance etc; Optimal backoff sleep time","Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuits; Investments; Power management (telecommunication); Sleep research; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient coverages; Human intervention; Real-time application; Sleep time; Wireless communications; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

Image forgery detection is piled up by the necessity of authenticity and to preserve integrity of the images. And in majority of the cases copy-move image forgery technique is used to alter the digital image, in which a portion of the image is copied and pasted somewhere else in the same image with the purpose to cover an important image characteristic. Here, copy-move image forgery detection scheme is implemented to detect tampered digital images using adaptive overlapped segmentation and feature point matching. It integrates both block-based and keypoint-based forgery detection methods. Adaptive overlapped segmentation algorithm segments the image into different superpixels. Then, the feature points are extracted from each part using SURF algorithm, and these features are matched with one another, if the match exceeded the preset threshold it will indicate the suspected forgery regions and then merged regions are generated. Finally, detected forgery regions are displayed by applying the morphological operation to the merged regions. © 2016 IEEE.","Copy-move image forgery detection; Overlapped segmentation; Region extraction","Computer crime; Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Forensic engineering; Forensic science; Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Copy-move forgery detections; Feature point matching; Forgery detections; Image characteristics; Image forgery detections; Morphological operations; Region extraction; Segmentation algorithms; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

The advanced encryption standard (AES) is one of the three cryptographic algorithms used in 4G networks for encryption of sensitive data. In spite of offering high immunity, AES is still vulnerable to few attacks. This weakness in AES algorithm makes 4G susceptible to several security issues. This paper specifically focuses on fault attacks performed on AES. A fault induced in any one of the rounds of AES helps the attacker to derive information about the secret key. In this manner, these fault attacks pose a serious threat to wireless mobile communication as he or she may gain access to any network that is encrypted with AES. In earlier works, various countermeasures have been suggested to prevent them. However, each of these preventive measures has their own limitations and vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an enhanced method of preventing fault attacks in AES by incorporating a combination of non-linear and linear diffusion techniques. This method identifies if a fault has been injected and diffuses the fault well into the matrix, providing no information about the secret key to the attacker. The performance evaluation proves that the proposed prevention method outperforms the others in terms of time, cost and efficiency.","Advanced encryption standard; Diffusion technique; Fault attack; Long term evolution","4G mobile communication systems; Data privacy; Diffusion; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Side channel attack; Wireless telecommunication systems; Advanced Encryption Standard; Cryptographic algorithms; Fourth generation (4G); Mobile Technology; Prevention methods; Preventive measures; Wireless communications; Wireless mobile communications; Cryptography",,,"Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre",0011748X,,DSJOA,,"English","Def.

With more critically important applications being designed for the WSN, security becomes a matter of prime importance. Though a lot of work has been carried out in the field of security for WSN, yet providing a robust security framework remains an open research challenge. One such open research domain is prevention of node replication attack, where the adversary takes control of a node from the network and steals all the security related credentials like node identity, keys, keying mechanism etc. and generates duplicate clones of the compromised node with the same security parameters. Building a defence mechanism against such node replication attacks has become an important research topic. The design principles has given directions to more threatening and different challenges which are more difficult to detect then typical attacks that are application dependent. There are several protocols that have been documented regarding node replication attacks. However, in depth study of this protocols reveal that robust prevention mechanism against such kind of attack is debatable and several vulnerabilities exist. In this paper, we propose a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Link Quality Indicator (LQI) and Packet Sequence Number based protocol that allows the legitimate nodes to detect the presence of any adversary placed clone node, and reporting it back to the base station thereby preventing a node duplication attack. © 2016 IEEE.","Link Quality Indicator; Node Localisation; Node Replication Attack; Received Signal Strength Indicator; Scalability; Set Operations","Cloning; Engineering research; Integrated circuits; Network security; Packet networks; Scalability; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Link quality indicators; Node localisation; Node Replication Attack; Received signal strength indicators; Set operation; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification.

Soft sets are a new mathematical approach to uncertainty and vagueness. In this paper, a hybrid segmentation algorithm based on soft sets namely soft fuzzy rough c-means is proposed to extract the white matter, gray matter and the cerebro spinal fluid from MR brain image with bias field correction. In this algorithm, soft fuzzy rough approximations are applied to obtain the rough regions of image. These approximations are free from defining thresholds, weight parameters and are less complex compared to the existing rough set based algorithms. Soft sets use similarity coefficients to find the similarity of the clusters formed in present and previous step. The proposed algorithm does not involve any negative region, hence all the pixels participate in clustering avoiding clustering mistakes. Also, the histogram based centroids choose the centroids close to the ground truth that in turn effect the definition of approximations, standardizing the clusters. The proposed algorithm evaluated through simulation, compared it with existing k-means, rough k-means, fuzzy c-means and other hybrid algorithms.

In this study, we use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images from healthy normal, early PD, SWEDD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, process them to compute shape- A nd surface-fitting-based features. We use these features to develop and compare various classification models that can discriminate between scans showing dopaminergic deficit, as in PD, from scans without the deficit, as in healthy normal or SWEDD. Along with it, we also compare these features with striatal binding ratio (SBR)-based features, which are well established and clinically used, by computing a feature-importance score using random forests technique. We observe that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier gives the best performance with an accuracy of 97.29%. These features also show higher importance than the SBR-based features. We infer from the study that shape analysis and surface fitting are useful and promising methods for extracting discriminatory features that can be used to develop diagnostic models that might have the potential to help clinicians in the diagnostic process. © 2017 IEEE.","Computer-aided early detection; Parkinson's disease (PD); pattern classification; quantification and estimation; scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD); shape analysis; surface fitting","Computer aided analysis; Computerized tomography; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Fiber optic sensors; Neurodegenerative diseases; Particle beams; Patient treatment; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Computer aided; Parkinson's disease; scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD); Shape analysis; Surface fitting; Single photon emission computed tomography; ioflupane i 123; Article; comparative study; controlled study; corpus striatum; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; human; image analysis; image segmentation; medical informatics; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; single photon emission computed tomography; statistical analysis; support vector machine; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; Parkinson disease; procedures; single photon emission computed tomography; Brain; Disease Progression; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Parkinson Disease; Support Vector Machine; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21682194,,ITIBF,"28113827","English","IEEE J.

Low resolution in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) coronary videos poses a threat to calcium detection causing over-estimation in volume measurement. We introduce a correction block that counter-balances the bias introduced during the calcium detection process. Method Nineteen patients image dataset (around 40,090 frames), IRB approved, were collected using 40 MHz IVUS catheter (Atlantis® SR Pro, Boston Scientific®, pullback speed of 0.5 mm/sec). A new set of 20 generalized and well-balanced systems each consisting of three stages: (i) calcium detection, (ii) calibration and (iii) measurement, while ensuring accuracy of four soft classifiers (Threshold, FCM, K-means and HMRF) and workflow speed using five multiresolution techniques (bilinear, bicubic, wavelet, Lanczos, Gaussian Pyramid) were designed. Results of the three calcium detection methods were benchmarked against the Threshold-based method. Results All 20 well-balanced systems with calibration block show superior performance. Using calibration block, FCM versus Threshold-based method shows the highest cross-correlation 0.99 (P<0.0001), Jaccard index 0.984±0.013 (P<0.0001), and Dice similarity 0.992±0.007 (P<0.0001). The corresponding area under the curve for four calcium detection techniques is: 1.0, 1.0, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. The mean overall performance improvement is 38.54% and when adapting calibration block. The mean workflow speed improvement is 62.14% when adapting multiresolution paradigm. Three clinical tests shows consistency, reliability, and stability of our well-balanced system. Conclusions A well-balanced system with a combination of Threshold embedded with Lanczos multiresolution was optimal and can be useable in clinical settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Calibration; Classification; Coronary calcium volume; Low-resolution IVUS; Multiresolution; Speed","Calcium; Classification (of information); Heart; Image segmentation; Speed; Titration; Ultrasonic applications; Volume measurement; Coronary calcium; Intravascular ultrasound; Low resolution; Multi-resolution techniques; Multiresolution; Multiresolution paradigms; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Quantitative assessments; Calibration; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; coronary calcium detection; coronary calcium volume; female; human; intravascular ultrasound; intravascular ultrasound catheter; kernel method; male; priority journal; workflow; algorithm; blood vessel calcification; calibration; computer assisted diagnosis; computer interface; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; interventional ultrasonography; middle aged; procedures; videorecording; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Calibration; Coronary Vessels; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Ultrasonography, Interventional; User-Computer Interface; Vascular Calcification; Video Recording","Suri, J.S.; Monitoring and Diagnostic Division, AtheroPoint™United States; email: Jasjit.Suri@atheropoint.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28390284","English","Comput.

This facilitates cardiologists to critically assess the cardiac function or dysfunction in a patient in terms of their left ventricle's performance, measured as its ejection fraction. Fuzzy c-means based pixel clustering is used for automatic segmentation. The left ventricle in all frames in the complete cardiac heartbeat cycle are extracted after being automatically loaded and segmented. In each image, pixels are grouped into two clusters-foreground and background. After the clustering, connected component analysis labels the pixels into connected regions. The left ventricle region is heuristically selected based on the distance from the image center and eccentricity. This novel original pixel clustering with labeling approach avoids manual initialization or user intervention. This method fully automatically extracts the left ventricle with more accuracy than manual tracing on all slices in the MRI images of the complete cardiac heartbeat cycle. The average computational processing speed per frame is 0.6 seconds, making it much more efficient than level sets, active contours, or other deformable methods, which need many iterations for the evolution of the snake or contour. Accuracy of the automated method presented herein was validated against manual tracing-based extraction. After performing the comparison on four MRI frames, it was found that an average correlation coefficient of 0.95 between the automatic and manual left ventricle segmented boundaries was higher than an average correlation coefficient of 0.85 between two manual tracing-based segmentations of the same. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Biology; Extraction; Fuzzy systems; Heart; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Numerical methods; Pixels; Automatic segmentations; Average correlation coefficients; Computational processing; Connected component analysis; Connected component labeling; Ejection fraction; Fuzzy C means clustering; User intervention; Image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467376662,,,"English","Int.

However in addition to the vessel edges the non vessel edges also gives a strong response to the matched filter leading to false detection. Based on the structural and spatial differences between the segmented vessels and the non vessels components, we propose a classification technique using machine learning approach to mask out the false detection due to non vessel structures.

The strengths of textural features derived from all different combinations of intensity, gradient magnitude and gradient direction are analysed. It is observed that both the magnitude and direction of intensity gradient contains significant textural information. Texture features can be substantially enriched by combining the features extracted from intensity, magnitude and direction of the intensity gradient as compared to that obtained from intensity alone. This approach is invariant to orientation of the texture and shape of the region of interest (ROI).

Industrial use-cases may have varied data rate requirements from very low data rates in the order of few kilo bits per second, to upwards of hundreds of kilo bits per second or may be in mega bits per second.

While considering the lumbar Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), identification of pathologies is a complex task as the size of the soft tissues may vary. Before recognizing the injury in the soft tissue, it is necessary to identify in which soft tissue, the pathology occurs. In order to address this issue, the classification of lumbar Intervertebral Discs (IVDs) on lumbar MRI is performed. The classification is determined after feature extraction on the region of interest. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is applied to extract the features and a model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. A multi-class classification is performed on 80 subjects, both T1-weighted and T2-weighted, with a total of 960 Intervertebral Discs.

The conflict between spectrum underutilization and spectrum scarcity is solved by a well-known technology called Cognitive Radio (CR). The main aim of CR is to exploit unutilized spectrum of licensed users/Primary Users (PUs) and enable opportunistic communications for unlicensed users/Secondary Users (SUs). CR communications need a primary technique called Spectrum Sensing which enables the CR users to accustom to their environment by finding frequency bands of PU that are idle (Spectrum Holes-SHs). There is a need to develop a technique that increases the accuracy of sensing not at the cost of sensing efficiency, as majority of the existing cooperative sensing schemes do not pose the benefit of cooperation. Our proposed work presents a Group based Cooperative Sensing Scheme (GCSS) to make a balance between accuracy and efficiency of sensing. An analytical model has been developed in both time-invariant and time-variant channel conditions using which sensing parameters like efficiency and accuracy are analyzed. An optimization scheme to achieve maximum throughput is developed. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GCSS outperforms as compared to the other existing schemes. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Cooperative Sensing; Optimization; Spectrum; Throughput","Communication channels (information theory); Efficiency; Frequency bands; Optimization; Radio systems; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bandwidth consumption; Cooperative sensing; Extensive simulations; Opportunistic communications; Performance analysis; Spectrum; Time variant channels; Wireless application; Cognitive radio",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

The duplicate frames are eliminated and label each frame as text and non-text before it can be given for detection and recognition of text in a frame.

Distinctive features of MANET makes the routing process complex, therefore the routing protocol is very significant for determining the network performance and its networking capacity.

Discrete wavelet transformation using 'haar' function is used for image denoising. Also it extracts high frequency components of image where in wavelets representation of image details is presented in high frequency subbands. After denoising the noisy image multiple kernel fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is applied to separate an image into number of homogeneous non overlapped closed regions. Also this algorithm computes the fuzzy membership values of each pixel. Based on Multiple kernel fuzzy c-means clustering edge indicator function was redefined. Then Adaptive level set method is applied to extracting the boundaries of objects on the basis of the MKFCM segmentation.

Video on demand is the current demand from everyone and which is in a high rise and the mobile operators are in a plan of migrating their current IP based infrastructure of LTE to attain new business in the market, online gaming, radio broadcast, webcast, live streaming apps, file sharing are the other services. Many mobile users wanted to have TV support on their mobiles to watch movies, promos and so on. A set of first solutions to this requirement was Media FLO, DVB-H/DVB-T, ISDB-T etc. So from user point of view, it was very good since they can have both mobile phone and TV on a single device with a small extra cost. But for the service provider's point of view, it is not that simple story. Mobile phone network and mobile TV network is totally different and separate, so it is big investment to deploy the network for mobile TV. In view, we can have another simple and powerful broadcasting mechanism for radio broadcast globally. The expected demand is only met when the current serving infrastructure is upgraded. To achieve this one possible solution would be LTE cell transmission with eMBMS. Using this the available bandwidth can be effectively utilized and required content can be delivered with an optimized eMBMS. Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a bi-directional and IP based service which is best used when serving such kind of services. Commercial systems need to be installed to effectively cater the needs. The main objective of the proposed solution is to address the future needs with few key optimizations. The main objective is to optimize the MCE scheduling algorithm using evolved Round Robin technique is to serve more contents to users with optimized radio resource allocation in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.","Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS); evolved Round Robin Algorithm (eRR); Long term Evolution (LTE); MBMS Coordination Entity (MCE); Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)","Bandwidth; Broadcasting; Cellular telephones; Digital multimedia broadcasting; Digital television; Digital video broadcasting (DVB); Distributed computer systems; Economics; Electronic document exchange; Internet protocols; Investments; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Multimedia services; Optimization; Radio broadcasting; Routers; Scheduling algorithms; Telephone sets; Video on demand; Video streaming; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadcast and multicast; Broadcasting mechanism; MBMS Coordination Entity (MCE); Multimedia broadcast multicast services; Radio resource allocation; Round Robin algorithms; Round-robin scheduling; Single frequency networks; Long Term Evolution (LTE)",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

It is a common problem faced in photography when trying to capture image of a scene having bright source in it or taken in a very bright environment. Glare can hide useful information in the image, can make foreground objects blurry and deformed. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect glare, mainly focusing on scenario where users take photo of scene having light source in outdoor environment during night. The method described in the paper takes combination of three different masks of original image to detect the glare. First mask is obtained by image segmentation of original image using our improved Bernsen's local thresholding method. To obtain second mask, we binarize the original image by simple thresholding to get specular hot-spot of light present in the original image and for the third mask, we apply thresholding on each RGB channel of original image. Finally, glare is detected using connected component computation on aforementioned masks.

In this work we have introduced a hybrid approach for news story segmentation based on conditional random fields (CRFs). The story boundary detection problem is converted into a shot classification problem by classifying video shots into either of the four categories. These are start shot, end shot and middle shots of a story or single shot story. To achieve this classification, we have introduced two new features. These are overlay text based semantic similarity and grid-wise edge orientation histogram. The first feature measures the semantic similarity between video shots by linking them through a set of web news articles. We use overlay text with their relevance as weight to link a set of articles with the video shots. The second feature captures the variations in presentation formats. The CRF model effectively combines these two features to model the news stories. Experimental results on approximately 50 hours of news videos demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed features. We were able to achieve an F1 score of 81% with our proposed features. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Image segmentation; Random processes; Semantics; Video signal processing; Boundary detection; Conditional Random Fields(CRFs); Edge orientation histograms; News story segmentation; Presentation formats; Semantic similarity; Shot classification; Story segmentation; Pattern recognition",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10514651,9781509048472,PICRE,,"English","Proc.

We combine the feature matching cost defined using the learned hierarchical features of given left and right stereo images, with the pixel-based intensity matching cost to form the data term. The features are learned in an unsupervised way using the deep deconvolutional network. Our regularization term consists of an inhomogeneous Gaussian markov random field (IGMRF) prior that captures the smoothness as well as preserves sharp discontinuities in the disparity map. An iterative two phase algorithm is proposed to minimize the energy function in order to estimate the dense disparity map. In phase one, IGMRF parameters are computed, keeping the disparity map fixed, and in phase two, the disparity map is refined by minimizing the energy function using graph cuts, with other parameters fixed. Experimental results on the Middlebury stereo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Markov processes; Pattern recognition; Dense disparity estimation; Dense disparity maps; Energy functions; Hierarchical features; Inhomogeneous gaussian markov random field (IGMRF); Intensity matching; Regularization terms; Two phase algorithm; Stereo image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10514651,9781509048472,PICRE,,"English","Proc.

In the second step, we evolve level sets within a narrow band to accurately track the target contour.

Some recent studies have posed the problem of data clustering as a multiobjective optimization problem, where several cluster validity indices are simultaneously optimized to obtain robust clustering solutions. Since no validity index performs equally well in all kinds of images, identifying the best set of validity indices to be optimized simultaneously is therefore an important problem. In this article, we study an interactive genetic algorithm based multiobjective fuzzy clustering technique for satellite im-age clustering problem. The algorithm simultaneously finds the clustering solution as well as evolves the set of validity measures that are to be optimized simultaneously. The method periodically interacts with a human decision maker (DM) and adaptively learns to obtain the optimum set of validity measures along with the final clustering result. The performance of the technique has been demonstrated on an Indian city, Kolkata and compared with that of some other existing clustering techniques. © 2016 IEEE.","cluster validity index; decision maker; image segmentation; interactive multiobjective clustering; Pixel classification","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Fuzzy clustering; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pixels; Satellites; Cluster validity indices; Clustering techniques; Decision makers; Fuzzy clustering techniques; Interactive genetic algorithm; Multi-objective clustering; Multi-objective optimization problem; Pixel classification; Image segmentation","Mukhopadhyay, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of KalyaniIndia; email: anirban@klyuniv.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053841,,,"English","IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

Feature extraction is very important for predictive modeling applications. Feature extraction in image processing is a method of capturing visual content of images for indexing and retrieval. Primitive image features can be either general features, such as extraction of color, texture and shape or domain specific features.

However, an erroneous packet may contain both erroneous bits and correct bits and hence it may still contain useful information. The receiver may be able to combine this information from multiple erroneous copies to recover the correct packet. Packet combining (PC) is a simple and elegant scheme of error correction in transmitted packet, in which two received copies are XORed to obtain the bit location of erroneous bits. Thereafter, the packet is corrected by bit inversion of bit located as erroneous. Aggressive packet combining (APC) is a logic extension of PC primarily designed for wireless communication with objective of correcting error with low latency. PC offers higher throughput than APC, but PC does not correct double bit errors if occur in same bit location of erroneous copies of the packet. A hybrid technique is proposed to utilize the advantages of both APC and PC while attempting to remove the limitation of both. In the proposed technique, applications of APC-PC on Gilbert two state model has been studied. The simulation results show that the proposed technique offers better throughput than the conventional APC and lesser packet error rate than PC scheme. © 2016, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Aggressive packet combining scheme; Combined APC-PC; Gilbert two states model; Packet combining scheme","Data communication systems; Error analysis; Error correction; Wireless telecommunication systems; Automatic repeat request; Combined schemes; Hybrid techniques; Packet combining; Packet error rates; Transmission error; Two-state; Wireless communications; Errors","Bulo, Y.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: yakabulo@gmail.com",,"Springer India",22502106,,,,"English","J.

Various methodologies for detection in forward-looking infrared imagery, which has higher spatial resolution, has been discussed by a number of researchers in literature. The algorithm we developed in the present study detects tanks not only in higher resolution but in lower resolution imagery as well. Detection algorithm is initiated by the segmentation of thermal image using mean shift, which provides possible targets present in the field other than the background. To reduce clutter and uneven illumination in a thermal image, a pre-processing morphological algorithm based on top-hat filtering has been implemented. After convolution of image window with Gabor filter banks, we extracted the energy feature of each image generated after convolution. The energy vector of such a target and the neighbouring background window has been calculated, and the similarity between the target and background using distance-measuring method has been measured. The minimum distance is used as the threshold to decide the target. A comparative study has been carried out between tanks and various targets/objects that appear similar to tanks in a thermal image. This validates our target detection algorithm. The false-positive rate and true-positive rate have been calculated for performance evaluation. Overall, this algorithm shows promising results for tank detection using single-band thermal imagery. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Airborne single-band thermal image; mean shift segmentation; morphological processing; top-hat filtering","Armored vehicles; Convolution; Feature extraction; Gabor filters; Image segmentation; Military vehicles; Signal detection; Tanks (containers); Forward-looking infrared imagery; Mean-shift segmentation; Morphological algorithms; Morphological processing; Target detection algorithm; Texture feature extraction; Thermal images; Top-hat filtering; Image processing","Gautam, A.K.; Defense Terrain Research Laboratory, Defense Research and Development Organization, Metcalfe House, Civil Lines, India; email: shshgautam@gmail.com",,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",03341860,,JISYE,,"English","J Intell Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016730382

However this transmission could be liable to hackers who may modify the whole medical image or only a part of it during transit. To guarantee the integrity of a medical image, digital watermarking is being used. This paper presents two different watermarking algorithms for medical images in transform domain. In first technique, a digital watermark and Electronic Patients Record (EPR) have been embedded in both regions; Region of Interest (ROI) and Region of Non-Interest (RONI). In second technique, Region of Interest (ROI) is kept untouched for tele-diagnosis purpose and Region of Non-Interest (RONI) is used to hide the digital watermark and EPR. In either algorithm 8 × 8 block based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) has been used. In each 8 × 8 block two DCT coefficients are selected and their magnitudes are compared for embedding the watermark/EPR. The selected coefficients are modified by using a threshold for embedding bit a ‘0’ or bit ‘1’ of the watermark/EPR. The proposed techniques have been found robust not only to singular attacks but also to hybrid attacks.

The manual assessment of pathology slides is time-consuming and complicated regarding various types of cell identification. This paper proposes an ensemble rule-based decision-making approach for morphological classification of erythrocytes. Firstly, the digital microscopic blood smear images are pre-processed for removal of spurious regions followed by colour normalisation and thresholding. The erythrocytes are segmented from background image using the watershed algorithm. The shape features are then extracted from the segmented image to detect shape abnormality present in microscopic blood smear images. The decision about the abnormality is taken using proposed multiple rule-based expert systems. The deciding factor is majority ensemble voting for abnormally shaped erythrocytes. Here, shape-based features are considered for nine different types of abnormal erythrocytes including normal erythrocytes. Further, the adaptive boosting algorithm is used to generate multiple decision tree models where each model tree generates an individual rule set. The supervised classification method is followed to generate rules using a C4.5 decision tree. The proposed ensemble approach is precise in detecting eight types of abnormal erythrocytes with an overall accuracy of 97.81% and weighted sensitivity of 97.33%, weighted specificity of 99.7%, and weighted precision of 98%. This approach shows the robustness of proposed strategy for erythrocytes classification into abnormal and normal class.

Detection of edges for an image may help for image segmentation, data compression, and image reconstruction. Edges of an image are considered a type of crucial information that can be extracted by applying detectors with different methodologies. Its main purpose is to simplify the image data in order to minimize the amount of data to be processed. There exist many rich classical edge detection techniques which make use of integer-order differentiation operators and can function in both spatial and frequency domains. In the case of integer-order differentiation operators, the gradient operator is identified by order ‘one’ and the Laplacian by order ‘two.’ This paper demonstrates a new kind of edge detector based on the ‘fractional’ (‘non-integer’)-order differentiation operation and through the usage of the ‘fractional Fourier transformation’ tool, so as to perform it in the fractional Fourier frequency domain, known as the edge detection based on fractional signal processing approach. It is shown through computer simulations that this approach can detect the edges precisely and efficiently. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated from the quantitative aspects of mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio through simulations.

For the last two decades, a tremendous amount of research has been dedicated in developing automated methods for segmentation of blood vessels from retinal fundus images. Despite the fact, segmentation of retinal vessels still remains a challenging task due to the presence of abnormalities, varying size and shape of the vessels, non-uniform illumination and anatomical variability between subjects. In this paper, we carry out a systematic review of the most recent advancements in retinal vessel segmentation methods published in last five years. The objectives of this study are as follows: first, we discuss the most crucial preprocessing steps that are involved in accurate segmentation of vessels. Second, we review most recent state-of-the-art retinal vessel segmentation techniques which are classified into different categories based on their main principle. Third, we quantitatively analyse these methods in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve and discuss newly introduced performance metrics in current literature. Fourth, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the existing segmentation techniques. Finally, we provide an insight into active problems and possible future directions towards building successful computer-aided diagnostic system. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fundus image; Retinal vessel; Review; Segmentation","area under the curve; Article; diagnostic accuracy; human; image analysis; image processing; image segmentation; ophthalmoscopy; retina blood vessel; retina fluorescein angiography; scanning laser ophthalmoscope; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; eye fundus; pathology; procedures; retina blood vessel; retina disease; Algorithms; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Vessels","L Srinidhi, C.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: srinidhipy@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",01485598,,JMSYD,"28285460","English","J.

Hence it has become one of the major research areas. Conventional image segmentation techniques are unable to provide satisfactory segmentation results for medical images as they contain irregularities. They need to be pre-processed before segmentation. In order to obtain the most suitable method for medical image segmentation, we propose MIST (Medical Image Segmentation Tool), a two stage algorithm. The first stage automatically generates a binary marker image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology. This marker serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses GrabCut to yield an efficient segmented result. The obtained result can be further refined by user interaction, which can be done using the proposed Graphical User Interface (GUI).

It aims at improving the visual and informational quality of the distorted images. Histogram equalization is one of the most frequently used techniques for image contrast enhancement. However, histogram and most of the other enhancement approaches may yield un-natural looking or artifacts after enhancement, and the images computed by these methods are not desirable in few applications such as consumer electronic products where brightness preservation is necessary to avoid annoying artifacts. To overcome such problems, a new optimal grey level mapping based edge preserved satellite images enhancement technique using a beta differential evolution (BDE) algorithm has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method uses a simple grey-level mapping technique and beta differential evolution algorithm together with corresponding enhancement operators for quality contrast and brightness boosting of the satellite images. In this approach, the grey levels of the input image are replaced by a new set of grey levels. The proposed algorithm has been tested on numerous colored satellite images and also on standard Lena image. Further qualitative and statistical comparisons of the proposed BDE with artificial bee colony, modified artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution algorithms are presented in the paper, which have proven its superiority in terms of PSNR, MSE, SSIM, FSIM and EKI indices. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial bee colony; Beta differential evolution; Color image enhancement; Grey-level mapping; Particle swarm optimization","Algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Luminance; Mapping; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Satellites; Artificial bee colonies; Brightness preservations; Color image enhancement; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Grey levels; Image contrast enhancement; Image processing applications; Edge detection","Bhandari, A.K.; Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and ManufacturingIndia; email: bhandari.iiitj@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09236082,,MUSPE,,"English","Multidimens Syst Signal Proc",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939177934

Actually the efficiency of these variants of HE depend on the optimal segmentation and proper modification of histogram.

Most of the models use a center prior to detect salient objects. They give more weightage to the objects which are present near the center of the image and less weightage to the ones near the corners of the image. But there may be images in which object is placed near the image corner. In order to handle such situation, we propose a position prior based on the combined effect of the rule of thirds and the image center. In this paper, we first segment the image into an optimal number of clusters using Davies-Bouldin index. Then the pixels in these clusters are used as samples to build the Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are refined using Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Thereafter the spatial saliency of the clusters is computed based on the proposed position prior and then combined into a saliency map. The performance is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on six publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the seventeen existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of F –measure and area under curve on all the six datasets. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cluster validation; Expectation maximization; Gaussian mixture model; Rule of thirds; Salient object detection; Spatial saliency","Algorithms; Computer vision; Gaussian distribution; Maximum principle; Object detection; Object recognition; Cluster validation; Expectation - maximizations; Gaussian Mixture Model; Rule of thirds; Salient object detection; Spatial saliencies; Image segmentation","Singh, N.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: navjot.singh.09@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978149950

Thus, contrast enhancement to improve visual information is extremely important in the development of computational approaches for obtaining quantitative measurements from medical images. In this research, a contrast enhancement algorithm that applies gray-level S-curve transformation technique locally in medical images obtained from various modalities is investigated. The S-curve transformation is an extended gray level transformation technique that results into a curve similar to a sigmoid function through a pixel to pixel transformation. This curve essentially increases the difference between minimum and maximum gray values and the image gradient, locally thereby, strengthening edges between adjacent tissues. The performance of the proposed technique is determined by measuring several parameters namely, edge content (improvement in image gradient), enhancement measure (degree of contrast enhancement), absolute mean brightness error (luminance distortion caused by the enhancement), and feature similarity index measure (preservation of the original image features). Based on medical image datasets comprising 1937 images from various modalities such as ultrasound, mammograms, fluorescent images, fundus, X-ray radiographs and MR images, it is found that the local gray-level S-curve transformation outperforms existing techniques in terms of improved contrast and brightness, resulting in clear and strong edges between adjacent tissues. The proposed technique can be used as a preprocessing tool for effective segmentation and classification of tissue structures in medical images. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contrast enhancement; Gray-level transformation; Medical imaging; S-curve","Curve fitting; Histology; Image segmentation; Luminance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image processing; Pixels; Tissue; Ultrasonic applications; Computational approach; Contrast Enhancement; Feature similarities; Gray-level transformation; Pixel transformation; Quantitative measurement; S Curve; Transformation techniques; Medical imaging; algorithm; Article; brightness; contrast enhancement; diagnostic imaging; echography; electron spin resonance; fluorescence imaging; human; luminance; mammography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ophthalmoscopy; priority journal; radiography; sigmoid; visual information; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","Kumar, D.; Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PetronasMalaysia; email: dileep.kumar@petronas.com.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28279861","English","Comput.

With the increase in wiring cables connecting these devices, the weight of a vehicle increases significantly and degrades the fuel efficiency during driving. In order to reduce the wiring weight, wireless communication has been introduced to replace wiring cables between some devices. However, the extra energy consumption and the transmission delay due to wireless communication need to be considered because they may result in frequent maintenance (e.g., recharging of batteries) and deadline violation, respectively.

Driven by technological advances in sensing, wireless communication, and machine learning, WMS-based systems have begun transforming our daily lives. Although WMSs were initially developed to enable low-cost solutions for continuous health monitoring, the applications of WMS-based systems now range far beyond health care. Several research efforts have proposed the use of such systems in diverse application domains, e.g., education, human-computer interaction, and security. Even though the number of such research studies has grown drastically in the last few years, the potential challenges associated with their design, development, and implementation are neither well-studied nor well-recognized. This article discusses various services, applications, and systems that have been developed based on WMSs and sheds light on their design goals and challenges. We first provide a brief history of WMSs and discuss how their market is growing. We then discuss the scope of applications of WMS-based systems. Next, we describe the architecture of a typical WMS-based system and the components that constitute such a system, and their limitations. Thereafter, we suggest a list of desirable design goals that WMS-based systems should satisfy. Finally, we discuss various research directions related to WMSs and how previous research studies have attempted to address the limitations of the components used in WMS-based systems and satisfy the desirable design goals. © 2015 IEEE.","Education; health care; human-computer interaction; machine learning; security; wearable medical sensor; wireless communication","Artificial intelligence; Education; Health care; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Medical computing; Wearable technology; Wireless telecommunication systems; Diverse applications; Health monitoring; Medical sensors; Scientific community; Scope of application; security; Technological advances; Wireless communications; Wearable sensors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23327766,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Once a thyroid nodule has been detected (or suspected), the first test that is routinely being performed is the fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (invasive). This test result is helpful in the classification of the nodule being benign or malignant with the aid of bio-markers. Another common test is the Ultrasound imaging (non-invasive). But, due to the inherent spatial limitations within the Ultrasound image, distinguishing the different pathological conditions related to Thyroiditis are challenging. The aim of this study is to classify multiple pathological conditions related to Thyroiditis by analyzing various textural image features extracted from ultrasound images. The thyroid Ultrasound images are retrospectively collected (with biopsy results) from a private scan center in Chennai, India. The image database contains thirty five Adenoma conditions, sixteen Hashimoto's conditions and twenty five normal cases. The abnormal conditions on the Ultrasound images are drawn manually by the experienced radiologist and stored as a 'ground truth'. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix and the gray-level run-length features of the 'hand drawn' region of interest (ROI) are extracted for each image. The features are then analyzed using the statistical unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test and classified based on the 'ground truth' data. The t-test shows a significant (p<0.001) differences between the groups. The texture features extracted from the Ultrasound images proves that the thyroid disorders such as Adenoma and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis can be distinguished from the normal using the highlighted texture features. © 2016 IEEE.","Adenoma; FNAC; Hashimoto's; Texture Features; Thyroiditis","Biopsy; Image segmentation; Testing; Tumors; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic imaging; Adenoma; FNAC; Hashimoto's; Texture features; Thyroiditis; Image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023769,,,"English","IEEE Int.

However, there has been no drastic improvement in terms of the resources to monitor and regulate the vehicular traffic. This leads to frequent congestion in roads and the delay in reaching any destination within the city limits has become inevitable. One of the advancements in wireless technologies to address this issue is Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) Infrastructure. As one among the service application of VANET, the Congestion Rate (CR) information is essential for travelers to make adaptive decisions and avoid overcrowding. This paper proposes a novel approach to calculate CR in a target geographic area for the smart vehicles of VANET Infrastructure using fuzzy based controllers. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to reduce the computational complexity owing to the irregularity of traffic and frequent updation of CR value in VANET. Further, simulation models of moderate traffic were created using VISSIM and their corresponding CR values are evaluated using fuzzy logic controller in MATLAB.

For patient presenting with symptoms of tumor should be diagnosed properly. Since treatment may not cure at the later stage, researchers must aim to produce maximal benefit to the patient with minimal burden, taking quality of survival into account as well as the duration. The computed tomography scan images are limited by the resolution of the imaging. In the field of Medical Resonance Image processing the image segmentation and denoising are very important and challenging problems in an image analysis. In this research paper the framelet transform for image denoising is implemented. Furthermore, the main purpose of segmentation in MRI images is to diagnose the problems in the normal brain anatomy and to find the location of tumor. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for segmentation of MRI images to extract the exact area of the brain as preprocessing steps for tumor location with image denoising. As a part of performance evaluation, 1000 images of patients are captured from different MRI centers under different conditions. Neuroradiological research consists of several brain extraction algorithms which are useful for several post- automatic image processing operations like segmentation, registration and compression. The result of proposed algorithm is validated by comparing proposed algorithm with the results of the existing segmentation and Denoising algorithms. © 2017 ACM.","Brain extraction algorithm; Clustering; Image segmentation; T2 weighted image; Translation Invariant Directional Framelet Transform","Brain; Cloud computing; Clustering algorithms; Computerized tomography; Extraction; Image registration; Image segmentation; Internet of things; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Medical problems; Neurology; Patient treatment; Tumors; Automatic image processing; Brain extraction; Clustering; Computed tomography scan; De-noising algorithm; Framelet transforms; Performance evaluations; T2-weighted images; Image denoising","Shah, V.; Electronics and Communication Engineering Dept., Sarvajanik College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: vandana.shah@scet.ac.in","Hamdan H.Boubiche D.E.Hidoussi F.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450347747,,,"English","ACM Int.

The objective is to propose an efficient technique for object identification, localization, and report generation to monitor the inventory level in real time video stream based on the object appearance model. The appearance model is considered as visual signature by which individual object can be detected anywhere via camera feed. Herein, Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) are used to identify the object. Firstly, SURF features are extracted from prototype image which refers to predefined template of individual objects, and then extracted from the camera feed of inventory i.e. scene image. Density based clustering on SURF points of prototype is done, followed by feature mapping of each cluster to SURF points in scene image. Homographic transforms are then used to obtain the location and mark the presence of objects in the scene image. Further, for better invariance to occlusion and faster computation, a novel method for tuning the hyper parameters of clustering is also proposed. The proposed methodology is found to be reliable and is able to give robust real time count of objects in inventory with invariance to scale, rotation and upto 70% of occlusion. © 2016 IEEE.","cluster parameter tuning; homographic transform; Object counting; speeded up robust feature","Artificial intelligence; Cameras; Image segmentation; Inventory control; Supply chains; Video streaming; Cluster parameters; Density-based Clustering; Industrial machine vision; Object counting; Object identification; Real-time video streams; Speeded up robust features; Supply chain network; Object detection",,"Yang M.Arabnia H.R.Deligiannidis L.Deligiannidis L.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055104,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Optic disc is an anatomical feature of retinal image which is considered as a first step for blood vessel segmentation and behaves as a land mark for retinal disease identification. Optic disc is a bright portion of retinal image and share similar properties with early pathology like exudates of Diabetic retinopathy disease. Thus, it is difficult to locate in retinal image due to the presence of similar pathology and non-uniform illumination in retinal image. In proposed approach pixel intensity is used as primary component and only bright pixel are considered for optic disc detection. Secondly, we have assumed that OD is a unique region in the retinal image having blood vessels converges on it. Therefore the optic disc can be localized by correlating every pixel value in the test image with a similar template having an OD at the centre. Finally a blood vessel map is extracted using large window sized median filter. The location of optic disc obtained is verified by the presence of blood vessel pixels in 10×10 window of the optic disc. The result of the proposed method is verified on two standard publicly available DRIVE [13] and DIARETDB1 [15] datasets comprises of 129 images, out of which optic disc in 126 retinal images is detected accurately. © 2016 IEEE.","L0 norm; Morphological operation and Diabetic retinopathy (DR); Optic disc (OD)","Eye protection; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Median filters; Ophthalmology; Pathology; Pixels; Anatomical features; Blood vessel segmentation; Diabetic retinopathy; L<sub>0</sub> norm; Non-uniform illumination; Optic disc; Optic disc detections; Optic disc localization; Blood vessels",,"Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032518,,,"English","Int.

The presented methodology automatically segments the colon gland tissues by using intensity based thresholding which makes this methodology efficient. Unlike other segmentation methods, this methodology is entirely automated and quantifies lumen and epithelial cells only in the region of interest, which makes this method computationally efficient.

Though manual segmentation provides with good results but automated analysis of retinal images is more promising as it reduces time and effort required by the experts. Diabetic Retinopathy is such a disorder of an eye which can be mostly seen in a person suffering from diabetes. If this disease is not recognized earlier the person may suffer from complete blindness.

At the beginning of this disease mainly the joints of hand and wrist are affected making hand radiograph analysis very important. Lately manual JSW measurement in hand X-ray digital radiograph of Arthritis patients were in use but it has disadvantages like inaccuracy, inter-reader variability. Also hand radiograph analysis is difficult for radiologist since in all there are 14 number of hand joints. To avoid observer dependency, computer-aided analysis is required. We have proposed the use of image processing techniques using MATLAB to analyze joint space narrowing. In this paper bone boundaries are delineated with Active Shape Model which contains statistical model of bone shape and local texture. Joint positions are identified by local linear mapping based on texture features. We have examined five hand radiograph images affected by RA. Joint location estimate accuracy is 92%. The automated analysis helps to reduce need of skilled personnel. Also remote analysis and medication is possible. © 2016 IEEE.","Active contour; Active shape model; Rheumatoid Arthritis","Automation; Bone; Computer aided analysis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Process control; Radiography; Active contours; Active Shape Models; Image processing technique; Joint space narrowing; Local linear mapping; Rheumatoid arthritis; Statistical features; Statistical modeling; Diseases",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509020805,,,"English","Int.

Emerging broadband wireless applications have demanded extraordinary increase in radio spectrum resources. As a result, we had been going through a critical spectrum shortage problem. However, numerous recent measurements reveal very low spectrum utilization in most beneficial frequency bands. Cognitive radio generation is a promising generation that can essentially enhance the spectrum usage of licensed frequency bands through secondary spectrum access. Spectrum scarcity is a big and vital problem in wireless communication system nowadays. Defining and designing new applications, developing users and their needs, especially the fixed spectrum allocation policy/strategies have made the problems more serious. The spectrum sensing problem has gained new dimensions with cognitive radio and opportunistic or dynamic spectrum access ideas. To overcome this we investigated a method of frequency sensing which is based on frequency comparison using a phase frequency detector (PFD). In this method output of PFD is used to sense the spectrum without any information of incoming or received signal, channel parameters or noise. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Frequency comparison; Phase frequency detector; Spectrum sensing","Automation; Frequency bands; Phase comparators; Plasma diagnostics; Process control; Radio systems; Spectroscopy; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadband wireless applications; Dynamic spectrum access; Frequency comparison; Phase frequency detectors; Secondary spectrum access; Spectrum sensing; Spectrum utilization; Wireless communication system; Cognitive radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509020805,,,"English","Int.

Though many researchers have implemented various algorithms and techniques for character recognition in different languages, ancient characters conversion still poses a big challenge. Because image recognition technology has reached near-perfection when it comes to scanning English and other language text. But optical character recognition (OCR) software capable of digitizing printed Tamil text with high levels of accuracy is still elusive. Only a few people are familiar with the ancient characters and make attempts to convert them into written documents manually. The proposed system overcomes such a situation by converting all the ancient historical documents from inscriptions and palm manuscripts into Tamil digital text format. It converts the digital text format using Tamil unicode. Our algorithm comprises different stages: i) image preprocessing, ii) feature extraction, iii) character recognition and iv) digital text conversion. The first phase conversion accuracy of the Brahmi script rate of our algorithm is 91.57% using the neural network and image zoning method. The second phase of the Vattezhuthu character set is to be implemented.

Understanding of land cover changes that occurred during the past decade is necessary to formulate policies and actions for sustainable land management. Land cover changes affect ecosystem and global climate. These changes transform natural habitats of plant and animal species and also modify air temperature and near surface moisture content which leads to many drastic changes in climate. Land cover change study helps climate and ecosystem scientists in understanding role of land cover changes in bringing climate and ecosystem changes. This paper has used segmentation-based data mining approach on MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data for understanding of land cover changes in states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Data smoothing using Savitzky-Golay filtering method has been performed before applying algorithm for land cover change detection. Algorithm is able to identify the time point of change along with type of land cover change. The findings show a lot of industrialization and urbanization in Surat and its satellite towns. Other major cities such as Ahmedabad and Jaipur have shown urban growth towards periphery over a period of time. Although agricultural area has got reduced due to urban growth but barren land has got converted into agricultural area as irrigation facility has improved over time due to emergence of Narmada Canal Network. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Agricultural; Change point; LANDSAT; LISS3; MODIS; NDVI; Remote sensing data; Savitzky-Golay filtering; Segmentation; Urban","Agriculture; Data mining; Ecology; Ecosystems; Image segmentation; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Signal filtering and prediction; Urban growth; Agricultural; Change-points; LANDSAT; LISS3; MODIS; NDVI; Remote sensing data; Savitzky Golay Filtering; Urban; Climate change",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348461,,,"English","ACM Int.

In this study, the authors have developed a new algorithm called, exponential ant colony optimisation (EACO) to route discovery problem in wireless sensor network after finding the cluster heads (CHs) using fractional artificial bee colony (FABC) algorithm. In the first step, CHs are found out using the FABC algorithm with fitness function considering the distance, energy and delay. In the second phase, ACO algorithm is modified with exponential smoothing model for multi-path route discovery. This new algorithm called, EACO found the optimal routes among CHs to transmit a data from any source node to base station with multiple objectives including energy, distance, intra-cluster delay and intercluster delay. These objectives are effectively formulated as new fitness function to find the optimal route path. From the experimentation, the outcome showed that the cumulative energy kept after 2000 round of experiments is 0.2039 for the proposed algorithm but the existing approach (threshold + ACO) kept only 0.0338. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Artificial bee colonies; Cumulative energy; Exponential smoothing model; Fitness functions; Multi path route discoveries; Multiple-objectives; Route discovery; Wireless technologies; Clustering algorithms","Kumar, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I.K.G.

As earlier TB detection methods do not ensure accurate results, there is an immediate action required to detect the disease with proper tools. To address this issue, a novel mechanism is proposed to detect tuberculosis in chest radiographs. The proposed method includes a three stage process of accurate detection of tuberculosis. In the first stage, lung segmentation using adaptive thresholding is utilized to segment the chest images which have different illumination. The second stage of feature extraction modifies the input image into a set of features which extracts relevant information contained in the chest image. In the third stage of process, k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (k-NN) outputs the decision that the input image is normal or abnormal. The detection process is evaluated using four performance analyzing criteria: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Simulation result shows that the accuracy of our proposed system is 4% more than the graph-cut based TB detection system. A comparison task is also performed to measure the quality of classifier among three classifiers: k-NN, support vector machine and artificial neural network classifier. Results show that k-NN classifier outperforms the other two classifiers with much lower misclassification rate. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive thresholding; classification; feature extraction","Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Extraction; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Image processing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Radiography; Text processing; Adaptive thresholding; Area under the ROC curve; Artificial neural network classifiers; Detection methods; Detection process; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Misclassification rates; Three-stage process; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

The method is applied on the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)) image of the heart for the detection of stenosis. The region of interest is considered as the coronary arteries and is segmented using vessel enhancement diffusion filter along with dilation and erosion morphology. Centerlines of the segmented arteries are extracted using a fast marching based method. Detection of the stenosis is done by estimating the vessel diameter at each centerline location. The abrupt reduction in the diameter of the arteries is a sign of stenosis. The proposed method is evaluated with a set of images and it gives 86.67% accuracy for detecting the stenosis.

The proposed approach employs a new methodology for segmenting the blood vessels from the retinal images more effectively. The overall process is carried out in five steps. The first step is to pre-process the image in order to remove the presence of noise in it and to convert the color image to grey scale image. Second step is the border detection process where the of the blood vessels is are moved by a border detection algorithm. Third step is the texture features are extracted from the detected border and then these features are given as input towards the Improved Fuzzy C Means clustering (IFCM) method in order to produce the membership function. Fourth step is the defuzzification process in which the outputs of the inference obtained for each pixel is combined to a final segmented output which provides a segmented foreground against the background. Final step is the Post-processing process where the unwanted pixels are filled or removed. Our proposed algorithm is tested over 180 images in order to analyse its efficiency.

The sink will recover the final aggregate with just t shares using CRT. The multi-objective of the proposed technique is to provide data privacy, identity privacy, source location privacy, and route privacy. The solution also mitigates the problem of packet losses associated with the unreliable wireless communication medium by improving the reliability. We also propose an enhanced privacy preserving routing technique that achieves network wide routing paths, and overcomes the drawback of existing phantom single-path routing (PSPR) and forward random walk-based routing (FRW) schemes.

Image processing algorithms have been deployed to automatically delineate various layers for autonomous width profiles computation. Classical OCT segmentation algorithms are anchored around gradient and its derivatives. Such pixel information can vary from subject to subject so prior approximations of different layers are imposed in the name of regularization. Regularization restrains the generalization capability of the model which is crucial for segmentation in pathological subjects. The presented approach aims to model signal interactions with a tissue type through back scattered signal characteristics. During prediction phase, given an unknown interaction, the model estimates the probability of signal being backscattered from a tissue type. Sensor's ballistic models are employed to estimate the uncompressed signal statistics. These models have been experimented and evaluated on 5000 AMD (age-related macular degeneration) and 5000 normal B-scans from Duke OCT dataset.

In the second step, a novel technique is developed for the extraction of robust markers to locate the accurate position of the suspicious lesions. Finally, the extracted markers are used within the watershed algorithm to allow the reliable segmentation and quantification of masses in mammograms.

However, current state-of-the-art for automatic latent fingerprint recognition is not as reliable as live-scan fingerprints and advancements are required in every step of the recognition pipeline.

There are three major contributions of this research: (i) a machine learning algorithm for combining five different categories of features for automatic latent fingerprint segmentation, (ii) a feature selection technique using modified RELIEF formulation for analyzing the influence of multiple category features on latent fingerprint segmentation, and (iii) a novel SIVV based metric to measure the effect of the segmentation algorithm without the requirement to perform the entire matching process. The image is tessellated into local patches and saliency based features along with image, gradient, ridge, and quality based features are extracted. Feature selection is performed to study the contribution of the various category features towards foreground ridge pattern representation. Using these selected features, a trained Random Decision Forest based algorithm classifies the local patches as background or foreground.

The main challenge in contrast enhancement is that an algorithm suitable for low contrast distorted images does not suit for high contrast distorted images. In this paper, an efficient contrast enhancement algorithm with automated parameterization is proposed using the concept of genetic algorithm and fuzzy intensification operator. Main focus of the proposed method is to improve the visibility information of an image by manipulating their intensity information. Simulation results of the proposed fuzzy-genetic based method were compared with standard existing methods such as log, gamma, linear contrast stretching, histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization and rule based fuzzy method using their default parameter values. Performance of the proposed and existing methods on very low, low, moderate, high and very high levels of contrast distorted images were quantitatively measured using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and feature similarity index measure (FSIM). The PSNR, SSIM and FSIM values were statistically analysed by two-way ANOVA. Results of this experiment inferred that (a) the contrast enhancement techniques performed well when the level of distortions were very low to moderate, (b) contrast enhancement was better in the proposed fuzzy-genetic based method than other existing methods, and (c) overall, the proposed fuzzy-genetic based method performed well on very low to very high levels of distorted images with higher PSNR, SSIM and FSIM values than other existing methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Contrast enhancement; Fuzzy intensification operator; Genetic algorithm; Quantitative analysis","Chemical analysis; Computer vision; Equalizers; Genetic algorithms; Graphic methods; Image processing; Image segmentation; Signal to noise ratio; Adaptive histogram equalization; Contrast Enhancement; Fuzzy intensification; Histogram equalizations; Image contrast enhancement; Image processing and computer vision; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity index measures (SSIM); Algorithms","Satheesh Kumar, J.; Department of Computer Applications, Bharathiar UniversityIndia; email: jsathee@rediffmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982843274

Skin regions show slightly different chrominance properties for different ambient conditions. Accuracy of detection is mostly affected either due to background colour similarity with the skin and/or poor illumination condition. To address this specific issue, a novel skin detection method is proposed by utilizing the information of pixel distribution in an image for a particular colour space. In our method, a local skin distribution model (LSDM) is derived from the image pixel distribution model using pixels from the facial region as reference. Finally, a combined skin distribution model is obtained by fusing the LSDM with the global skin colour distribution model. Subsequently, a dynamic region growing (DRG) method is proposed to allow the skin regions to grow dynamically. Our proposed DRG minimizes the overall detection error. Experimental results show that proposed skin detection method can more accurately segment out the skin-coloured regions. We obtained total detection error of 12.87% for a standard database. This improvement is due to the fact that both local and global skin colour information are used for skin segmentation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Image pixel distribution; Region growing; Skin detection; Skin probability map (SPM)","Color; Error detection; Image segmentation; Probability distributions; Skin; Dynamic region growing; Illumination conditions; Image pixels; Natural environments; Region growing; Skin Detection; Skin probability maps; Skin-colour segmentation; Pixels","Bhuyan, M.K.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Assam 781039, India; email: mkb@iitg.ernet.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678655,,,,"English","Pattern Recogn.

Hence, there is a requirement of an efficient classification technique to reduce congestion in the network so that throughput of various applications can be increased. Classification helps in searching, sorting, retrieval, and querying of a document for the wireless networks. World Wide Web (WWW) contains huge repository of information in the form of web pages. However, size of Internet is growing day-by-day. The huge repository of information poses challenge to collect and process the relevant related information of a particular domain. So, traditional text classification techniques are difficult to apply on the rapidly growing web-based contents. Hence, novel approaches and techniques need to be devised to reduce the manual efforts in web page classification. Keeping focus on these points, this paper proposes a novel approach for multiclass classifier based on unique personality features of the web page of particular domain category for the next generation wireless networks. Personality features are collected and assigned weights in the proposed scheme. Then, the proposed classifier is trained based on these special features. Results obtained depict that proposed classifier successfully classified news domain pages, education, resume, online shopping, and research web pages from large database repository. Accuracy of the proposed classifier is found to be satisfactory from a large data set of different categories.

The segmented hand bones are of vital importance in process of automated bone age assessment (ABAA). Bone age assessment is a technique of checking the skeletal development and detecting growth disorder in a person. However, it is very difficult to segment out the bone from the soft tissue. The problem arises from overlapping pixel intensities between bone region and soft tissue region and also between soft tissue region and background. Thus there is a requirement for a robust segmentation technique for hand bone segmentation. Taking this into consideration we make a comparison between non-evolutionary and evolutionary segmentation algorithms implemented on hand radiographs to recognize bone borders and shapes.

RS code is a promising code for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) which is ideally suitable for wireless application. Design of compact, high-speed and low-power RS(23, 17) code is challenging for today’s wireless communication systems. Here, an optimization algorithm is introduced which is very simple and it is employed to reduce the number of XOR gates required to design constant Galois Field (GF) multipliers. In this paper, a compact RS(23, 17) encoder and decoder circuit is designed and implemented for Ultra Wide Band(UWB) application. The number of two input XOR gates is reduced by 29.27 (20.00) and 56.10 (66.15) % respectively for local and global optimization compared to unoptimized RS encoder (syndrome block) without increasing its delay. The proposed algorithm is also employed to design the RS(204, 188) and RS(255, 223) encoder. All designs are simulated and synthesized for Vertex4 FPGA platform. Proposed algorithm is also used for the design of Chien Search and Forney blocks. Implemented RS(23, 17) codec requires lesser number of slices and LUTs over the unoptimized RS codec.

The researcher community aims at developing a salient object detection model that matches the detection accuracy as well as computation time taken by the humans. These models can be developed in either spatial domain or frequency domain. Spatial domain models provide good detection accuracy at the cost of high computational time while frequency domain models offer fast computational speed to meet real-time requirements at the cost of poor detection accuracy. In order to induce a trade-off between computational time and accuracy, we propose a model which provides high detection accuracy without taking much of computation time. To detect the salient object with an accurate shape, we first segment the given image by utilizing a bipartite graph partitioning approach which aggregates multi-layer superpixels in a principled and effective manner. Second, the saliency of each segmented region is computed based on a hypercomplex Fourier transform (HFT) saliency map reconstructed using amplitude spectrum, filtered at an appropriate scale chosen using statistical features extracted from grey- level co-occurrence matrix and original phase spectrum. Finally, a saliency map is generated by taking average of the HFT coefficients of each region in the segmented image and then using the average HFT intensity value of the entire image as a threshold to clearly separate salient object from the background. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of F–measure, area under curve (AUC), and computation time using six publicly available image datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model against twenty popular state-of-the-art methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bipartite graph; Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM); Hypercomplex fourier transform (HFT); Saliency map; Salient object detection; Segmentation; Superpixel; Visual saliency","Economic and social effects; Frequency domain analysis; Graph theory; Image segmentation; Matrix algebra; Object recognition; Pixels; Superpixels; Bipartite graphs; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Hypercomplex Fourier transforms; Saliency map; Salient object detection; Visual saliency; Object detection","Arya, R.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: rinki.arya89@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",0924669X,,APITE,,"English","Appl Intell",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982293163

To support anytime-anywhere seamless broadband services to all mobile subscribers, more number of macro base stations (BSs) have to be deployed. The macro BSs are power inefficient and also responsible for large carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The increase in the number of macro BSs will also increase the system cost and interference. The concept of multi-hop relay network has been widely discussed in long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) standard, where the low power relay stations (RSs) are also deployed along with the macro BS to address the coverage and capacity issues. However, improper BS and RS deployment introduces power inefficiency, transmission delay, huge deployment cost and reduced throughput. Many of the conventional deployment schemes require iterative and complex computation. These deployment schemes are not eco-friendly and do not sustain for all channel conditions. In this work, we have proposed an eco-friendly, power-aware, fuzzy based BS and RS deployment algorithm to maximize the coverage and capacity of the system. Unlike the conventional methods, a new parameter called power consumption effectiveness ratio, which accounts for the greenness of the network is proposed and included in the fuzzy based decision making process along with the coverage ratio and traffic ratio. The simulation results prove that the proposed scheme is superior over the conventional uniform clustering and fuzzy based schemes. Further the proposed scheme is more suitable candidate for power-aware green radio communication. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","BS deployment; Coverage ratio (CR); Fuzzy logic; Multi-hop relay (MHR) network; Power consumption effectiveness ratio (PCER); RS deployment; Traffic ratio (TR)","Base stations; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Computation theory; Decision making; Electric power utilization; Environmental protection; Fuzzy logic; Iterative methods; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Low power electronics; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Standards; Telecommunication repeaters; Complex computation; Conventional methods; Coverage ratio; Decision making process; Deployment algorithms; Multi-hop relay; Multi-hop relay networks; RS deployment; Wireless telecommunication systems","Arthi, M.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: arthimdas@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",22105379,,,,"English","Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007502869

This approach consists of two stages: noisy pixel detection and correction. In former step, the noise-affected pixels in an image are detected, and in the latter step, the noisy pixels are restored by adaptive radial basis function-based interpolation scheme. The radial basis function interpolation scheme is used to estimate the unknown noisy pixel value from the noise-free known neighboring pixel values. For both noisy pixel detection and correction, a center sliding window is considered at each pixel location. The proposed approach is experimented on some benchmark data sets, and its performance is evaluated using five performance evaluation measures: PSNR, MSSIM, IEF, correlation factor, and NSER on different test images by comparing it against sixteen different state-of-the-art techniques. It is found that the proposed approach gives better results than the sixteen different state-of-the-art techniques. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptive radial basis interpolation filter; Edge preservation; Impulse noise; Radial basis function; Spline interpolation","Benchmarking; Functions; Image segmentation; Interpolation; Pixels; Radial basis function networks; Correlation factors; Edge preservations; Impulse noise removals; Interpolation filters; Radial basis function interpolation; Radial basis functions; Spline interpolation; State-of-the-art techniques; Impulse noise","Veerakumar, T.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Farmagudi, India; email: tveerakumar@yahoo.co.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012983014

In this paper, we propose a robust and computationally inexpensive scheme to detect moving objects in video. The threefold approach begins with computation of difference images using temporal information. Difference images are calculated by subtracting two input frames, at each pixel position. Instead of generating difference images using the traditional continuous frame difference approach, we propose using a fixed number of alternate frames centered around the current frame. This approach aids in reducing the computational complexity without compromising on quality of the difference images. After computation of difference images, a novel post-processing scheme is employed by utilizing gamma correction factor and Mahalanobis distance metric to reduce false positives and false negatives. Object segmentation is finally performed on the refined difference image by a local fuzzy thresholding scheme. This avoids problems that are usually encountered in hard thresholding, especially pixel misclassification, which is the most important one. For robust experimental analysis, videos from changedetction.net, CAVIAR, and http://perception.i2r datasets have been used. These selected videos contain a wide variety of common challenges faced during object detection. Some examples are the presence of dynamic backgrounds, shadows, bad weather, etc. The results establish the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over some of the existing schemes both qualitatively and quantitatively as delineated in the experimental result section. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Difference image; Dynamic background; Fuzzy thresholding; Ghosting; Moving object detection; Temporal information","Image coding; Image segmentation; Motion estimation; Object recognition; Pixels; Difference images; Dynamic background; Fuzzy thresholding; Ghosting; Moving-object detection; Temporal information; Object detection","Singh, A.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology SilcharIndia; email: ashish090494@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09208542,,JOSUE,,"English","J Supercomput",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978908831

A quick and perfect method for estimating the number and size of MS lesions in the brain is very important in estimating the progress of the disease and effectiveness of treatments. But, the accurate identification, characterization and quantification of MS lesions in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely difficult due to the frequent change in location, size, morphology variation, intensity similarity with normal brain tissues, and inter-subject anatomical variation of brain images. Methods This paper presents a method where adaptive background generation and binarization using global threshold are the key steps for MS lesions detection and segmentation. After performing three phase level set, we add third phase segmented region with contour of brain to connect the normal tissues near the boundary. Then remove all lesions except maximum connected area and corpus callosum of the brain to generate adaptive background. The binarization method is used to select threshold based on entropy and standard deviation preceded by non-gamut image enhancement. The background image is then subtracted from binarized image to find out segmented MS lesions. Results The step of subtraction of background from binarized image does not generate spurious lesions. Binarization steps correctly identify the MS lesions and reduce over or under segmentation. The average Kappa index is 94.88%, Jacard index is 90.43%, correct detection ration is 92.60284%, false detection ratio is 2.55% and relative area error is 5.97% for proposed method. Existing recent methods does not have such accuracy and low value of error rate both mathematically as well as visually due to many spurious lesions generation and over segmentation problems. Conclusions Proposed method accurately identifies the size and number of lesions as well as location of lesions detection as a radiologist performs. The adaptability of the proposed method creates a number of potential opportunities for use in clinical practice for the detection of MS lesions in MRI. Proposed method gives an improved accuracy and low error compare to existing recent methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Binarization; Brain MRI; Lesion segmentation; Level set; Multiple sclerosis; Normal tissues; Performance evaluation","Bins; Brain mapping; Errors; Histology; Image segmentation; Tissue; Binarizations; Brain MRI; Lesion segmentations; Level Set; Multiple sclerosis; Normal tissue; Performance evaluation; Magnetic resonance imaging; accuracy; Article; corpus callosum; entropy; human; image enhancement; image segmentation; multiple sclerosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; algorithm; brain; diagnostic imaging; multiple sclerosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multiple Sclerosis","Roy, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Institute of Computer Technology (UVPCE), Ganpat University, SolaIndia; email: sudiptaroy01@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28254088","English","Comput.

Each relay, when it becomes available (or arrives), offers a (possibly different) 'reward' to each forwarder. Each forwarder's objective is to minimize a combination of the delay incurred in choosing a relay and the reward offered by the chosen relay. As an example, we develop the reward structure for the specific problem of geographical forwarding over a common set of sleep-wake cycling relays. In general, our model can be considered as a game theoretic variant of the asset selling problem studied in the operations research literature. We study two variants of the generic relay selection problem, namely, the completely observable (CO) and the partially observable (PO) cases. These cases are based on whether a forwarder (in addition to observing its reward) can also observe the reward offered to the other forwarder. Formulating both problems as a two person stochastic game, we characterize the solutions in terms of Nash equilibrium policy pairs (NEPPs). For the CO case, we provide a general structure of the NEPPs. For the PO case, we prove that there exists an NEPP within the class of threshold policy pairs. Through numerical work, for a one-hop forwarding example, we compare the cost performance of various NEPPs with a simple forwarding (SF) policy, which causes each forwarder to act as if the other is not present. We find that if the forwarders are not very close then the SF policy suffices. Insights gained from this numerical work are then used in an end-to-end simulation of geographical forwarding in a large network, in which we are concerned with delivery of packets from a tagged source to a sink, in the presence of competition from other packet flows destined for the same sink. © 2017 IEEE.","Bayesian games; Competitive relay selection; Geographical forwarding; Stochastic games","Operations research; Stochastic systems; Wakes; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bayesian game; End-to-end simulation; Geographical forwarding; Nash equilibrium policy; Relay selection; Stochastic game; Threshold policies; Wireless communications; Game theory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",07338716,,ISACE,,"English","IEEE J Sel Areas Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018868805

Group key management techniques are used to secure communication among nodes in cognitive radio networks. This paper analyses total number of nodes that are pruned and renewed in ternary key tree during batch rekeying to measure the communication overhead. With this analysis, this paper proposes and implements an enhanced version of TKTOFT protocol (ETKTOFT) with modified batch rekeying scheme. From the simulation results, it is inferred that the proposed ETKTOFT protocol computationally outperforms SKM method and TKTOFT protocol by reducing the rekeying time to 57.16% and 15.14% respectively. Further, the proposed protocol generates 18% lesser number of renewed nodes than existingTKTOFT protocol thus reducing the communication overhead. As the proposed protocol minimizes both computation and communication overhead, it in turn can reduce the energy consumed by wireless mobile devices used in group oriented applications, thus increasing their lifetime. © 2017 CRL Publishing Ltd.","Batch rekeying; Cognitive radio networks; Group key management; Key tree; Pruned nodes; Renewed nodes","Cost reduction; Forestry; Radio; Radio systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Batch rekeying; Cognitive radio network; Group key management; Key tree; Pruned nodes; Renewed nodes; Cognitive radio",,,"CRL Publishing",02676192,,CSSEE,,"English","Comput Syst Sci Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021324097

However, designing an anonymous user authentication scheme in GLOMONET is a challenging task since wireless communication networks are susceptible to a variety of attacks and mobile devices are of limited storage, processing and communication capabilities. Recently, Miyoung and Rhee examined the schemes proposed by Wei et al. and Wu et al., and came up with an improved authentication scheme offering user anonymity in GLOMONET. We point out that Miyoung and Rhee scheme is exposed to off-line password guessing and user impersonation attacks. Also, their scheme cannot offer user anonymity, password change or updating option and quick detection of wrong password. In order to overcome the flaws present in Miyoung and Rhee scheme, we propose a dynamic ID-based generic framework for anonymous authentication scheme for roaming service in GLOMONET, which is invincible to various prying attacks of intruders. Furthermore, the performance analysis proves that our scheme is versatile, simple and secure when compared to the existing authentication schemes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Forward secrecy; Global mobile network; Off-line password guessing attack; Security; Smart card; User anonymity; User impersonation attack","Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smart cards; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Forward secrecy; Offline password guessing attack; Security; User anonymity; User impersonation attacks; Authentication","Karuppiah, M.; School of Computing Science and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: k.marimuthu@vit.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986255644

The high bandwidth demand and the large storage requirements are the main challenges in such systems. To face these challenges, the system can be deployed as a multi-tier framework that utilizes different technologies. In such a framework, technologies proposed under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a significant rule in facing the challenges. In video surveillance, the cameras can be considered as “the things” that are streaming videos to a central processing and storage server (the cloud) through the Internet. Wireless technologies can be used to connect wireless cameras to the surveillance system more conveniently than wired cameras. Unfortunately, wireless communication in general tend to have limited bandwidth that needs careful management to achieve scalability. In this paper, we design and evaluate a reliable IoT-based wireless video surveillance system that provides an optimal bandwidth distribution and allocation to minimize the overall surveillance video distortion.

In the former method we identified segmentation and object detection as being responsible for consuming most of the global processing time. While in the latter, as segmentation was not used, shape-based object detection was the compute-intensive task identified. Experimental results show that the accelerated method running on multi-GPU systems for blood detection in WCE images is on average 265 times faster than the original CPU version and is able to process 344 frames per second.

One of the most important applications is wireless medical sensor network (WMSN) which makes modern health-care more popular. The doctor can get the patient’s physiological data collected by special sensors deployed on or in the patient’s body in real time with the mobile devices via the wireless communication channel. The collected data are important and should be confidential. So security measures are considered in the process of communication. Recently, He et al. (Multimed Syst, 21(1), 49–60, 2015) proposed a new two-factor authentication scheme for health-care with WMSNs and claimed it to be secure. But we find that it is vulnerable to the off-line guessing attack, the user impersonation attack, and the sensor node capture attack. Moreover, we present an improved scheme to overcome the disadvantages. Through the formal verification with Proverif and the analysis presented by us, our scheme is secure. It is more practical for applications through the comparison between some recent schemes for WMSNs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Mutual authentication; Smart card; The off-line guessing attack; The sensor capture attack; Wireless medical sensor network","Authentication; Health care; Mobile devices; Sensor nodes; Smart cards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Guessing attacks; Medical sensor networks; Mutual authentication; The sensor capture attack; Two factor authentication; User impersonation attacks; Wireless communication channels; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Wu, F.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Xiamen Institute of TechnologyChina; email: conjurer1981@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",09424962,,MUSYE,,"English","Multimedia Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938819964

Additionally this research also focuses on occlusion detection and handling, which involves detecting and handling the states when one vehicle superimposes the other or when two superimposed vehicles split, and lane categorization i.e. dividing the vehicles in the moving traffic scene into their corresponding lanes of the road in which they are travelling in. The challenge taken up was to achieve all this using basic image processing techniques and algorithms and not compromise on the desired output, most importantly keeping the single frame processing time less and the speed of processed video playback to be comparable to that real-time video playback speeds. It is to note that all of the above is achieved through the techniques demonstrated in this research. The process cycle followed from frame extraction to the final classification of vehicles involves algorithms that are all highly region based and do the necessary processing only on the region of interest, only as and when required. Thus saving processing power and time.

Very rich and useful information about the electrical activities of the brain is provided by the EEG. The amplitude and frequency varies in the EEG signal when various mental tasks are executed. Due to the lengthy nature of the EEG data, computing it becomes quite hectic. Therefore in this paper, the dimensions of the lengthy EEG recorded data is reduced with the help of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Expectation Maximization Based Principal Component Analysis (EM-PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). After reducing the dimensions, the new obtained dimensionally reduced values are classified to get the epilepsy risk level from EEG signals with the help of a probabilistic model called Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The result analysis is performed with the benchmark terms like Performance Index, Accuracy, Quality Value and Time Delay. The most promising result in this study shows that when PSD is implemented as a dimensionality reduction technique and when classified with GMM, an average high accuracy of 97.46% is attained along with an average Performance Index of 94.69%.","EEG; EM-PCA; Epilepsy; GMM; PSD; SVD","Benchmarking; Biomedical signal processing; Brain; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Industrial research; Interfaces (computer); Maximum principle; Neurology; Power spectral density; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Singular value decomposition; Spectral density; Time delay; Dimensionality reduction techniques; EM-PCA; Epilepsy; Expectation - maximizations; Gaussian Mixture Model; Power spectral densities (PSD); Probabilistic mixture models; Probabilistic modeling; Brain computer interface",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509050963,,,"English","Int.

Igneous rock is most abandoned rock in nature. The classification of Igneous rocks in its two types namely Plutonic and Volcanic is a complex and tedious job because of homogeneity between the classes. In geology this classification process has been carried out on the manual basis regularly, requiring high geological expertise. But being done manually can subject to error and leads to unnecessary delay. Hence for automating the process, pattern classification approach is used. In this paper a locally relevant database of igneous rocks involving both the rock types is considered for experimentation and testing. The grain size is considered as a discriminating textural feature for this classification problem followed by identification statistical features for textural discrimination such as Haralick features, and Laws Masks. A Radial basis function support vector machine classifier is used for the classification providing machine learning approach and giving reasonable results. But In Igneous rocks, the image classes are overlapping in the feature space. So the Classification accuracy can be further increased if the hypothesis of the multiple Support vector machine (SVM) image classifiers are combined to give a single hypothesis for the classification of an image.

Clustering algorithms are part of data mining algorithm that groups the data into various number of given clusters. All the data points in one cluster have similar properties based on which they are clustered i.e. each cluster has minimum difference between its points and maximum difference from other cluster data points. The proposed algorithm uses k-mean algorithm and firefly to cluster image pixels into k cluster for segmentation. Since k-mean clustering algorithm is gets trapped in local optima it is optimized using firefly algorithm. Swarm intelligence based algorithms forms the basis of the firefly algorithm which has several application and used to solve optimization problems. Firefly algorithm has been applied in many research and optimization areas. Firefly algorithm and its hybridized version have been used to solve various problems successfully.

A method of selective region-based active contour model (ACM) is suggested in this work, in this first selectively penalizes the level set function to be binary, then uses a Gaussian smoothing kernel to regularize couture evolution. A new region-based signed pressure force (SPF) function is proposed, which can efficiently stop the contours at weak or blurred edges. Other feature is the exterior and interior boundaries can be automatically detected with the initial contour being anywhere in the image. The proposed ACM, it has the property of selective local or global segmentation.

Brain tumor detection is one of the most widely used applications by vast researchers. In this paper a novel approach is presented for detection of affected mass (tumor) in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two level wavelet transform is used to decompose the brain image with mother wavelet 'db6'. The horizontal, vertical and the diagonal components at both the levels are further decomposed to level five using histogram for each of the component using one dimensional wavelet transform. By finding global minima at level five, and then mapped at the component histogram, a threshold value is found out. The component then is thresholded using this adaptive threshold. The original image is then reconstructed with the obtained components using this course segmentation. The approximation component at level one is unaltered. Lastly a windowing technique is used to eliminate the false detection due to light in-homogeneity or due to hard tissues, which uses a window based threshold. Results after fine segmentation showed that normal patient images showed complete black region in the final segmented image whereas malignant images showed the region of interest after segmentation. The MRI images from a research institute were obtained and the results after segmentation were validated from an expert from the same research institute. © 2016 IEEE.","adaptive threshold; course segmentation; fine segmentation; global minima; Magnetic resonance images; wavelet transform; windowing technique","Brain; Brain mapping; Diagnosis; Graphic methods; Image compression; Image processing; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Tumors; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive thresholds; Adaptive wavelets; Fine segmentations; Global minima; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Region of interest; Research institutes; Windowing techniques; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026128,,,"English","Int.

Image foreground segmentation is a challenging task given problems due to complex background, clutter and occlusion, spectral variability in object appearance etc. Most of the techniques in this respect are semi-automatic in nature which require prior assumptions regarding the object location in the image in the form of rough bounding boxes. On the contrary, we propose a patch transfer based approach which propagates rough segmentation masks from the training to the test image patches. Further, these segmentation masks are combined and updated using a Markov random field model to generate the final foreground segmentation.

The fireworks algorithm (FWA) is a recently developed new Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithm for function optimization. This algorithm simulates the process of fireworks explosion in the night sky. The main characteristic of FWA is the good balance between exploration and exploitation during the search process. The exploitation is done using good fireworks whereas the bad fireworks are responsible for exploration. FWA shows its efficiency and effectiveness in numerical function optimization over other SI algorithm like particle swarm optimization (PSO). FWA-ATF is a modified version of basic FWA and in this work, it is used in hard clustering technique to segment the image. FWA-ATF is used to find the optimal cluster centroids corresponding to different regions in the image. The proposed clustering technique is applied to segment four benchmark images and the well-known cluster validity index-Dunn's Index is used to measure the performance of the proposed clustering technique quantitatively. The performance of the proposed method is compared with clustering using K-means, PSO and basic FWA. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed clustering technique with FWA-ATF performs better than other methods in segmentation for most of the images. © 2017 IEEE.","adaptive transfer function; clustering; Dunn's Index; Fireworks algorithm; optimization; segmentation","Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Explosives; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Transfer functions; Cluster validity indices; clustering; Clustering techniques; Dunn's Index; Exploration and exploitation; Fireworks algorithms; Function Optimization; Numerical function optimization; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027170,,,"English","Proc.

The segmentation of MR images of the neonatal brain is a fundamental step in the study and assessment of infant brain development. The highest level of development techniques for adult brain MRI segmentation are not suitable for neonatal brain, because of substantial contrasts in structure and tissue properties between newborn and fully developed brains. Current newborn brain MRI segmentation techniques either depend on manual interaction or require the utilization of atlases or templates, which unavoidably presents a bias of the results towards the population that was utilized to derive the atlases. In this paper, we proposed an atlas-free approach for the segmentation of neonatal brain MRI, based on the neural network approach.

Skin lesions show distinct color variations as they evolve from benign to malignant one. The use of different color spaces can provide the best discriminative information of lesions embedded in a particular color channel and used in efficient segmentation of a digital image. A simple and efficient method for the automatic segmentation of clinical images using colorspace analysis and improved binary thresholding algorithm is proposed. Clinical images taken from normal mobile cameras have the inherent problem of improperly illumined background compared to dermoscopic images. The proposed algorithm corrects these constraints with initial pre-processing steps of adjustments of clinical image. The algorithm has been evaluated using 175 images from different online public databases. The efficiency of the overall segmentation process is carried out by calculation of similarity matrices for segmented lesions from each color channel used.

To diagnose the disease, it needs to be segment the retinal area. In this paper, we have proposed the preprocessing and segmentation. Preprocessing is done on the original image using Gamma Normalization which brings the intensity value in a particular range. Gamma Normalization helps to enhance the image which gives better detail of the image. Then the segmentation is performed on the Gamma Normalized image. Segmentation is done by Superpixel method. Superpixel is the group of pixel into different regions which is based on compactness and regional size. Adaptive SLIC has been used for superpixalation. Adaptive SLIC is the algorithm for Superpixel generation which is use to set parameter adaptively for each Superpixel. Superpixel is used to decrease the difficulty of image processing task and supply suitable primitive image pattern. Our method is more faster, improve segmentation performance, memory efficient and straightforward to extent to Superpixel generation than other methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Gamma Normalization; Retinal Area; Segmentation; Superpixel (SLICO)","Image processing; Intelligent control; Ophthalmology; Pixels; Power control; Power electronics; Gamma Normalization; Intensity values; Memory efficient; Normalized image; Original images; Retinal Area; Segmentation performance; Super pixels; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

ZigBee has been identified earlier as the one of the most suitable wireless technology for Home Area Networks (HAN) of smart grid. Mesh network topology provides the secure and reliable means of data transmission in case of ZigBee network to be implemented in smart grid. In this work, a smart grid network has been designed to be developed in Jadavpur University Saltlake Campus, Kolkata (22.5733°N, 88.4137°E). The wireless sensor nodes have been identified in different areas of the campus and the load of different buildings has been monitored. Solar and wind power system controlled by WSN technologies has been also installed to meet the excess load demands. A central control station will monitor the load distribution throughout the campus and hence will make load leveling possible. Optimum numbers of wireless nodes have been planned to ensure that all the buildings are covered along with continuous and reliable data delivery to the control station.

The similarities between the objects in the same group are high when data are well clustered and the similarities between objects in different groups are low. The data clustering technique is widely used in different areas such as bioinformatics, image segmentation and market research. All of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. There are many methods to find arbitrary shaped clusters. DBSCAN(Density Based Spatial Clustering with Noise) is an example of clustering algorithms. This method is able to detect communities of arbitrary size and shape. It is also used to identify hubs and outliers. However, it needs user to specify a minimum similarity ϵ and a minimum cluster size μ to define clusters, and is sensitive to the parameter ϵ which is hard to determine. To overcome this method, proposed a novel density based network clustering method called graph-based clustering (gClu). The main objective of the proposed system is to form clusters from a core connected tree with maximum accuracy and also to detect hubs and outliers. © 2016 IEEE.","CCMST; Clustering; Core Connected Components; DBSCAN; Hubs; OPTICS; Outliers","Cluster analysis; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Optics; Statistics; Trees (mathematics); CCMST; Clustering; Connected component; DBSCAN; Hubs; Outliers; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509008704,,,"English","Int.

In real-time, the usage of the radio spectrum is rigorously very low and the most of the spectrum is under-utilized. Recent researches in cognitive radio (CR) address these problems. In CR, spectrum sensing is a key factor. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is used for multicarrier data transmission. OFDM is found to be a suitable method for spectrum sensing in CR. However, spectral leakage and cyclic prefix (CP) in OFDM reduce the spectrum efficiency. Recently, for data transmission and spectrum sensing, multicarrier filter banks (FBMC) are recently considered as an alternative to OFDM. In this paper, we propose a two-stage spectrum sensing for CR, using Cosine Modulated Filter Banks (CMFB). To design the CMFB, we use two different prototype filters, namely, conventional Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and Frequency Response Masking (FRM) filter. The computational complexity of the two different designs are also compared. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bandpass filters; Communication channels (information theory); Data communication systems; Data transfer; Digital filters; Filter banks; FIR filters; Frequency division multiplexing; Frequency response; Impulse response; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio systems; Telecommunication industry; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cosine modulated filter banks; Frequency response masking; Future generations; Recent researches; Spectrum allocation; Spectrum efficiency; Two-stage spectrum sensing; Wireless communication system; Cognitive radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015408706

To enhance the security of the scheme, the feature is encoded using the convolutional based encoding prior to embedding into the appropriate sites of the ROI. The homogeneity analysis of the ROI is carried out using the quadtree based image segmentation to select homogeneous blocks of a fixed size depending upon the requirement of the application.

Speckle removal is substantial and critical step for preprocessing of ultrasound carotid images. For robust diagnosis, the carotid images must be free of noise and clear in clinical practices. The carotid ultrasound images have multiplicative noise and is very difficult to remove as compared to additive noise. To address this issue we propose to use Bayesian least square estimation in the logarithmic space. The proposed algorithm is tested on 50 ultrasound B mode carotid images and the performance of the algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms like Median filter, Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion(SRAD), Non Local Mean (NLM) filter, Total Variation (TV), Detail Preserving Anisotropic Diffusion(DPAD) filter, Lee filter, Frost filter and Wavelet filter.

With this increasing popularity, the number of mobile users under cellular communication is growing rapidly. But, in reality the radio frequency spectrum is very much limited. It is a hard job to allocate the limited spectrum among the multiple users. So, efficient channel allocation of radio spectrum has become a hottest research topic among the researchers. There are many channel allocation schemes based on FDMA, TDMA and CDMA technology proposed in the literature proving their efficiency. In this paper, a Fuzzy-Logic based Dynamic Channel Assignment Scheme (F-DCAS) is proposed to maximize the number of served calls in a distributed wireless cellular environment. The F-DCAS provides better fault-tolerant capability for variable traffic load thus yielding better performance compared to traditional FCA and DCA scheme. Simulation result proofs that call blocking probability, call dropping probability, handoff strategies, throughput and average channel utilization in proposed algorithm is better than the traditional FCA and DCA scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","Cellular Network; Channel Assignment Problem (CAP); Frequency Reuse","Blocking probability; Cellular radio systems; Combinatorial optimization; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal communication systems; Time division multiple access; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Call blocking probabilities; Cellular network; Channel assignment problem; Dynamic channel allocation; Dynamic channel assignment; Frequency re-use; High-speed data communication; Wireless cellular networks; Frequency division multiple access",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015371443

In this paper, the main aim is to detect leukocytes from human blood. These leukocytes protect the body from infectious diseases. If there is any type of disturbances in the blood count, then it may signify the presence of some cancer. Due to this reason, earlier many hematological experts examined blood samples by using medical instruments such as flow cytometer, for determining what type of disease is present in the human body. Since, the manual segmentation remains a very soporific, tiresome and error prone job, experts preferred to use automatic systems that results in accurate segmentation of leukocytes, which is needed for their classification. In this paper, the simple thresholding technique is used for segmentation of leukocytes by using Otsu thresholding. After segmentation, mathematical morphing is used to remove all components those do not look like leukocytes. Further, only the nucleus region was considered for feature extraction. Thereafter, Naïve Bayes classification technique is used for classification of leukocytes. The results obtained are better than other state of art algorithms, the classification accuracy on the training dataset of only 20 images and test image dataset of 68 images is about 80.88%, in an average time of 22 s per image. © 2016 IEEE.","leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC); mathematical morphing; Naïve Bays classifier; segmentation","Blood; Diseases; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Sodium; Statistical tests; Automatic classification; Bayes classification; Classification accuracy; Medical instruments; Morphing; Morphological features; Thresholding techniques; White blood cells; Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015416243

Processing of MRI/PET images for brain pathology detection is a challenging task for radiologists. To address this issue the performance of various segmentation techniques has been analyzed with Independent component analysis (ICA) as a pre-processing step for removal of salt and pepper and speckle noise at 5dB noise level. There are so many segmentation methodology used for medical diagnosis, which comes under the classification strategy like supervised and unsupervised segmentation, region and edge based segmentation. The methodologies considered in this paper will cover the main classification strategy of segmentation for brain abnormality. Mean Shift (MS), Fuzzy C Means (FCM), Hough Transform (HT), Normalized Graph Cut (NGC), Thresholding by Histogram (ThH) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are taken here for performance analysis. Experimental results suggest that, for PET images, pathology detection is found good while using ICA as denoising method for removing salt and pepper and speckle noise at 5dB and SVM as segmentation technique. Whereas for MRI images the performance of both ThH and SVM goes hand in hand as a segmentation methodology with ICA as noise removal method. The evaluation measure used here are Jaccard and Dice Coefficient, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Global Consistency Error (GCE), Under Segmentation (UnS), Over segmentation (OvS) and Incorrect Segmentation (InC), Selectivity, Specificity, Accuracy, Positive predictive value (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV). From the obtained results it is seen that SVM gives better result for detection of mild cognitive impairment in PET scan images and both SVM and ThH is performing good for brain tumor detection in MRI images, without affecting the image quality. © 2016 IEEE.","Denoising; Dice; ICA; Jaccard; PSNR; Segmentation; Specificity","Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Graphic methods; Hough transforms; Image denoising; Image quality; Image segmentation; Independent component analysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Pathology; Positron emission tomography; Salt removal; Signal to noise ratio; Speckle; Support vector machines; De-noising; Dice; Jaccard; PSNR; Specificity; Medical image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015424613

The joint histogram of the CT and noisy MR image has been modeled as Markov Random Field (MRF). Every element of the joint histogram has been estimated using the Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation criterion. The MAP estimates have been obtained jointly by Simulated Annealing (SA) and Iterative Conditioned Mode (ICM) algorithms. This estimated joint histogram has been used to compute the mutual information for different values of the registration parameter.

Several state of the art road detection techniques make use of the illuminant invariant feature space for classifying pixels. One of the assumptions used in the derivation of illuminant invariant image from the RGB image is that the surface being captured is a lambertian surface. The specular reflection of sunlight from the road surface, which is a common daytime occurrence violates the lambertian assumption. Thus, the methods based on illuminant invariant fail to detect the road region containing specularities. Another aspect where the algorithms need to be improved upon is the detection of white markings painted over the roads. These markings are not built into the road model. Hence, the road detection algorithms fail to classify them as part of road region. Here, we propose a novel specularity detection and removal method devised specifically for road detection which inherently eliminates the white markings present in the road image. This modification improves the road detection accuracy in the presence of specular reflections as shown by the results. Apart from the improvement in accuracy of the algorithm, it needs to function in real time on mobile platforms with low power consumption. For this, we implemented the algorithm using OpenCV on two low power development boards-BeagleBone Black and Raspberry pi-2, the latter being chosen for its capability of multiprocessing using 4 cores. These experiments provide a proof of concept of real time implementation. © 2016 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; Computer Vision; OpenCV; Path Detection; Segmentation","Automobile drivers; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Real time control; Real time systems; Roads and streets; Transportation; Autonomous Vehicles; Driver assistance system; Lambertian assumption; Low-power consumption; OpenCV; Path detections; Real-time implementations; Specularity detection; Road and street markings",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015376313

According to the studies, there are different types of skin cancers like melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carci- noma (SCC). Melanoma is a condition where the production of melanin is significantly reduced because of the dysfunctionality of melanocyte cells. One of the major factor that affects the melanocyte cell is sunburn due to the ultraviolet rays from the sun. The disorder can be identified by the shape, color and texture of skin lesion. The skin lesion can be normally separated into three as benign, atypical and melanoma.

It is the process of labeling objects into predefined and semantically meaningful categories using trained datasets. A classification is made using a segment of image which is actually a single pixel or a group of pixels which is called a classification unit. Many researchers are working in this area to improve the accuracy of object classification focusing on different features and classifiers. As SIFT feature dominates in current object classification problem, we incorporate Tensor features with SIFT to improve the accuracy of the problem. Moreover we use Deep Neural Network for classification which is a type of artificial intelligence that could solve complex perceptual problems as fast as human brain. Simulation results obtained illustrate that the proposed classifier model produces more accurate results than the existing methods which combines both SIFT and tensor features for feature extraction and DNN for classification. © 2016 IEEE.","Deep Neural Network; Object Classification; SIFT; Tensor","Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image segmentation; Pixels; Problem solving; Tensors; Classifier models; Human brain; Object classification; SIFT; SIFT Feature; Single pixel; Classification (of information)","Najva, N.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, MES College of Engineering, University of CalicutIndia; email: najvahassan@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509019861,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In this scheme a digital medical image is partitioned into region of interest (ROI) and the region of non interest (RONI). To detect and localize ROI tampering with high accuracy pixel wise positional and relational bits are calculated. Positional bit is calculated with respect to MSBs, row and column of the pixel. Relational bit shows the relation between MSBs. Two original LSBs of each ROI pixel are replace by their corresponding positional and relational bits. Original LSBs of ROI pixels are concatenated and embedded in RONI for ROI recovery in the case of tampering. Multiple watermarks i.e. electronic patient record (EPR), hospitals logo and LSBs of ROI are embedded simultaneously as a robust watermark in RONI using IWT-SVD hybrid transform. The proposed scheme is blind and free from false positive detection. Various experiments have been carried out on different medical imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, tamper detection, localization, recovery and computation time. ROI tampering is detected and recovered with high accuracy.

The Segmentation technique here utilizes fusion of information beyond human perception from MR images to develop a fused feature map. The information beyond human perception include second order derivatives that are computed from an image which are discussed in detail in relevant section of this paper. This obtained feature map acts as a stopping function for the initialized curve in the framework of an active contour model to obtain a well segmented region of interest. The segmentation is carried out in all the slices of a particular dataset with initialization of the active contour required only on the first slice which makes this method fast. The obtained segmentation results are compared with ground truth segmentation results obtained from experts manually using Jackard’s Co-efficient of Similarity and Overlap index. The boundaries of the segmented regions are utilized in surveyor’s algorithm to compute the volume of the tumors with high accuracy.

In this scheme, DWT is applied on ROI (region of interest) of the medical image to get different frequency subbands of its wavelet decomposition. On the low frequency subband LL of the ROI, block-SVD is applied to get different singular matrices. A pair of elements with similar values is identified from the left singular value matrix of these selected blocks. The values of these pairs are modified using certain threshold to embed a bit of watermark content. Appropriate threshold is chosen to achieve the imperceptibility and robustness of medical image and watermark contents respectively. For authentication and identification of original medical image, one watermark image (logo) and other text watermark have been used. The watermark image provides authentication whereas the text data represents electronic patient record (EPR) for identification. At receiving end, blind recovery of both watermark contents is performed by a similar comparison scheme used during the embedding process. The proposed algorithm is applied on various groups of medical images like X-ray, CT scan and mammography. This scheme offers better visibility of watermarked image and recovery of watermark content due to DWT-SVD combination. Moreover, use of Hamming error correcting code (ECC) on EPR text bits reduces the BER and thus provides better recovery of EPR. The performance of proposed algorithm with EPR data coding by Hamming code is compared with the BCH error correcting code and it is found that later one perform better. A result analysis shows that imperceptibility of watermarked image is better as PSNR is above 43 dB and WPSNR is above 52 dB for all set of images. In addition, robustness of the scheme is better than existing scheme for similar set of medical images in terms of normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) and bit-error-rate (BER). An analysis is also carried out to verify the performance of the proposed scheme for different size of watermark contents (image and EPR data). It is observed from analysis that the proposed scheme is also appropriate for watermarking of color image. Using proposed scheme, watermark contents are extracted successfully under various noise attacks like JPEG compression, filtering, Gaussian noise, Salt and pepper noise, cropping, filtering and rotation. Performance comparison of proposed scheme with existing schemes shows proposed scheme has better robustness against different types of attacks.

The proposed method applies the combination of discrete wavelet transform and discrete cosine transforms on the cover medical image for the embedding of image and electronic patient records (EPR) watermark simultaneously. The embedding of multiple watermarks at the same time provides extra level of security and important for the patient identity verification purpose. Further, security of the image and EPR watermarks is enhancing by using message-digest (MD5) hash algorithm and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman respectively before embedding into the medical cover image. In addition, Hamming error correction code is applying on the encrypted EPR watermark to enhance the robustness and reduce the possibility bit error rates which may result into wrong diagnosis in medical environments. The robustness of the method is also extensively examined for known attacks such as salt & pepper, Gaussian, speckle, JPEG compression, filtering, histogram equalization. The method is found to be robust for hidden watermark at acceptable quality of the watermarked image. Therefore, the hybrid method is suitable for avoidance of the patient identity theft/alteration/modification and secure medical document dissemination over the open channel for medical applications. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","DCT; DICOM; DWT; EPR; Hamming ECC; Image watermarking; MD5; ROI and NROI; RSA","Cosine transforms; Diagnosis; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Error correction; Hash functions; Image segmentation; Image watermarking; Medical applications; Paramagnetic resonance; Watermarking; Wavelet transforms; DICOM; Electronic patient record; Error correction codes; Hamming ECC; Histogram equalizations; Identity verification; Multiple watermarking; ROI and NROI; Medical imaging","Singh, A.K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jaypee University of Information TechnologyIndia; email: amit_245singh@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982263746

DMIMO system employs multiple relays each with single or multiple antennas in between the source and destination to form a virtual antenna array. However, a few of the fundamental difficulties in deployment of DMIMO networks with coherent communications are synchronization, tracking of independent oscillators, and channel estimation. The signal received at the destination is characterized by multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFOs) and MIMO channel effects due to sparsely distributed relay nodes. In this paper, we address the issue of joint estimation of frequency offset and channel gains in a DMIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems deploying multiple antennas at the relays. We consider estimate-and-forward (EF) protocol for relaying where the coarse estimation process at the low cost relays generates inter carrier interference (ICI) in a multi-carrier system resulting in severe performance degradation and decrease in reliability of the network. The two iterative estimators, expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE), are proposed to jointly estimate MCFOs and channel in the presence of ICI. The robustness of the estimators are evaluated through mathematical analysis and validated using simulations. The performance of the estimators is measured in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). Simulation results show that the proposed estimators provide a significant performance gain in DMIMO-OFDM systems with MIMO configuration at the relays compared to single-input single-output (SISO) system. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cooperative communication; ECM; Joint estimation; SAGE","Adaptive systems; Antenna arrays; Antennas; Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Cooperative communication; Estimation; Fading channels; Frequency allocation; Frequency division multiplexing; Frequency estimation; Maximum principle; Mean square error; Military electronic countermeasures; MIMO systems; Multicarrier modulation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Signal encoding; Wireless telecommunication systems; Distributed MIMO-OFDM systems; Expectation conditional maximizations; Joint estimation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems; SAGE; Single input single output systems; Space alternating generalized expectation maximization; Wireless communication system; Channel estimation","Sen, D.; Indian Institute of Technology, KharagpurIndia; email: debarati@gssst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983792616

Then based on the cluster validity measure, the optimal number of potential thresholds and the bounds where the optimal value of each potential threshold may exist are determined. Finally, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to detect the optimal value of each potential threshold from their respective defined bounds. The proposed technique incorporates spatial contextual information of the image in threshold selection process without loosing the benefits of histogram-based techniques. Computationally it is very efficient. Moreover, it is able to determine the optimal number of segments in the input image.

Our system achieves complete detection of abnormal events by involving the following significant proposed modules a Background Estimation (BE) Module, an Object Segmentation (OS) Module, a Feature Extraction (FE) Module, and an Activity Recognition (AR) Module. At first, we have presented a BE (Background Estimation) module that generated an accurate background in which two-phase model is generated to compute the background estimation. After a high-quality background is generated, the OS model is developed to extract the object from videos, and then, object tracking process is used to track the object through the overlapping detection scheme. From the tracked objects, the FE module is extracted for some useful features such as shape, wavelet, and histogram to the abnormal event detection. For the final step, the proposed AR module is classified as abnormal or normal event using the deep learning classifier. Experiments are performed on the USCD benchmark dataset of abnormal activities, and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our algorithm.

In segmentation, the entropy thresholding has been adopted in which the optimum threshold value to each color component of the image is obtained by maximizing the global entropy computed from its gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The segmented image consists of isolated cells and complex nuclei structures. A novel complex nuclei structure detection algorithm is proposed to identify overlapped nuclei structures, which have been further resolved by watershed transform. The performance of the segmentation technique is evaluated using the quantitative metrics, namely mean absolute difference (MAD), dice coefficient (DC) and accuracy. Global entropy thresholding-based segmentation technique achieved the best MAD of 0.478, DC of 0.967 and accuracy of 0.970 compared to state-of-art techniques such as otsu and active contour.

Based on the topography of the islands, the subsea current is comparatively more than the mainland. Most of the islands are not having self-sustained power sources due to the limitations of infrastructure even though the power requirement is less. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) of Ministry of Earth Sciences has undertaken the research and development of an ocean current power module for such islands. The first prototype ocean current turbine (OCT) power module was tested at Macpherson Strait in the Andaman open sea. The subsea power module of the system comprises of the turbine, transmission system, generator and the associated power and instrumentation systems. The development and implementation of electrical and instrumentation system for an underwater OCT power module are one of the challenging task, hence the entire system required to be designed for in-situ conditions.

GMA approximates these input RVs by an equivalent weighted finite sum of Gaussian components. Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a well-established approach to estimate the parameters of the mixture components. The critical aspect is to know a priori the optimal number of components approximating the non-Gaussian distributions. The estimation of optimal number of parameters is essential because the parameters with inappropriate components may not evaluate the mixture model accurately. This paper adopts a cluster distortion function-based approach to determine the optimal number of mixture components. The k-means clustering result pertaining to that optimal number is then used for EM initialization. PLF using multivariate-GMA is performed on two IEEE test systems, considering various types of input RVs and their multiple correlations. © 2016 IEEE.","Cluster number selection; correlation coefficient; Gaussian mixture approximation; photovoltaic generation; probabilistic load flow","Clustering algorithms; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Parameter estimation; Cluster numbers; Correlation coefficient; Gaussian mixtures; Photovoltaic generation; Probabilistic load flow; Electric load flow",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Many techniques are proposed to reduce PAPR, but those are reducing the PAPR at cost of increasing the bit error rate (BER).

The measurement of wall thickness from magnetic resonance (MR) images is a promising approach to measure the degree of carotid stenosis. Manual tracing of the carotid vessel walls is time consuming and is sensitive to observer variability. Further, the existing segmentation techniques are limited by the poor contrast and presence of noise in MR images. The objective this paper is to present a novel segmentation strategy for carotid lumen and outer wall from MR images. The segmentation has been carried out in two stages which starts with a user assisted region of interest selection. In the first stage, an active contour based global segmentation has been applied to classify the lumen region. In the second stage, morphological gradient of the region of interest has been computed. This is followed by particle swarm optimization based localized segmentation to separate the wall region. The results demonstrate excellent correspondence between the automatic and manual tracings for lumen and outer walls of the carotid artery. © 2016 IEEE.","Carotid artery; MRI; segmentation; stenosis; wall thickness","Imaging techniques; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Carotid artery; Carotid artery stenosis; Morphological gradient; Segmentation techniques; Semiautomatic methods; stenosis; Surgical interventions; Wall thickness; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Modern wireless communication systems uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which has high data rate transmission capability in addition to robustness to channel impairments. One of the major disadvantages of it is having high value of peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High value of PAPR drives power amplifier into saturation region and causes it to operate in the nonlinear region. In this paper different power amplifier linearization and PAPR reduction techniques have been discussed. Among power amplifier linearization techniques digital pre distortion outperforms when compared with feedback and feed forward techniques. On the other hand among different PAPR reduction techniques, DFT-spread technique results in the lowest PAPR value when compared with clipping and filtering (CF), selective mapping method (SLM) and partial transmit sequence (PTS). © 2016 IEEE.","Nonlinearity; Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing; Peak-to-Average Power Ratio; Power Amplifiers","Amplifiers (electronic); Digital storage; Feedback amplifiers; Feedback linearization; Frequency division multiplexing; Linearization; Microwave amplifiers; Microwave generation; Multiplexing; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adjacent channel interference; High data rate transmission; Microwave power amplifier; Nonlinearity; Partial transmit sequence; Peak to average power ratio; Power amplifier linearization; Wireless communication system; Power amplifiers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

To deliver a high QoS for users, an eNodeB requires a well-designed and efficient CA enabled downlink scheduling algorithm. Enabling aggregation of multiple component carriers leads to huge power consumption compared with non-CA scenario. To the best of our knowledge, CA enabled downlink scheduling mechanisms which have been proposed so far in the literature has not addressed simultaneously the QoS, carrier's power allocation and Physical Resource Block (PRB) utilization while taking scheduling decisions.

The proposed novel dynamic load balancing scheme effectively balances the user load across CCs while achieving high user throughput.

In this project, we propose to use a touch pad to construct a HAM radio interface. Low-power, short-range wireless communication interfaces which have become available with modern microcontrollers enable the construction of such systems which can allow users to exchange information within buildings. While Morse code was invented for telegraphy, its simplicity allows a person with physical disability to use it more effectively than a keyboard-based interface. Thus, such an interface can be useful in rehab centers, old-age homes and hospitals. Security systems are yet another domain where Morse code can be gainfully employed. Since the user must make use of touch, drag and release operations for Morse code signaling, it is difficult to prescribe any strict guidelines on the length of the drag or the time gap between two drags. Multiple users of the system will use the system at different speeds. We propose the use of Fuzzy logic with elements of machine learning to reduce the chances of misinterpreting the Morse code and adapting to different users. In order to demonstrate our project, we used the MSP430F5529 development kit from Texas Instruments which comes with a touch-pad, an LCD screen and an RF interface.

The comprehensive review has shown that the use of fuzzy enhancement is not considered in gray stretch based method. The existing technique provides poor results for complex background images. The effect of color images on segmentation is also ignored. The disadvantage of threshold based segmentation technique is that it can perform well for images, which contain only two components. Otsu's method fails to calculate accurate threshold value when there is no significant change in the gray level of pixels.

Nowadays, wireless communications has become important in communication process. The main way to transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves i.e. radio waves. However, radio waves can support less bandwidth because of compact spectrum availability and intrusion. Solution to this is data transmission using Visible Light Communication (VLC). Wi-Fi deals with wireless coverage within premises, whereas Li-Fi is perfect for high compactness wireless data coverage in defined area and for mitigating radio interference issues. In Li-Fi basically we focus to transmitting multimedia data between two terminals using LED's. Li-Fi is a transmission of data through illumination, in which data can be sent through a LED light bulb that varies in intensity faster than human eye can follow. The light which we are using in our daily life is not only used for providing light but also for communication by illumination. Transmission of image through LiFi technology is done.

Camera manufacturers, therefore, depend on image denoising algorithms to reduce the effects of such noise artifacts in the resultant image. The most common type of noise is impulse noise, in which the affected pixels are replaced by noise values which will be either zero or one. First, the noise pixel can be identified by switching method. Second, the median filter applied on every corrupted pixel. Third, compare the neighboring pixel value on input image with the median filtered image, if the two pixels having a difference then apply the M-filter on that. This paper mainly deals with the detection of noisy pixels and applying robust M-filter (lorentzian) method to improve the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and mean square error (MSE) value.

Vision loss is due to DR is preventable with regular checkups at the earlier stages. The presence of exudates is the basic signs of DR. Hence, exudates detection becomes a major problem-solving task, in which retinal images plays a vital role. In this paper, a technique is proposed depending on morphological closing operations which are in image processing is used to identify exudates from retinal image. At the starting phase, the retinal image must be preprocessed, where at first the image which is in RGB color format is altered to the image of HSI color format and on Intensity-band of HSI color format average filter is performed to reduce noise and subsequently contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization is performed to normalize the image. In subsequent phase, exudates are identified using morphological closing operation and then Nilblack's thresholding is applied.

For any vehicle to be recognized, vehicle license plate detection will play a major significant role in this active world. For finding vehicles commonly used in field of security and safety system, LPDR plays a significant role and we need to recognize vehicles registration number at a certain distance. This paper has four major steps as follows: Preprocessing of captured image, Extracting license number plate region, Segmentation and Character Recognition of license plate. In pre-processing the desired vehicle image is taken through the digital camera, brightness of image is adjusted, noise removal using filters and image is converted to gray scale. Exactions of license plate region consist of finding the edges in the image where exact location of licenses plate is located and crop it into rectangular frame. Segmentation plays a vital role in vehicle licenses plate recognition; the legibility of character recognition completely relies on the segmentation done. The approach which we have used is simple but appropriate. First we segmented all characters in the image (LP) using Bounding box method. Finally, recognition of each character is done. The template matching method is used for recognition each character in the vehicle license plate. © 2016 IEEE.","Bounding Box and filter; Licenses Plate Detection; Noise removal; Recognition; Segmentation","Accidents; Character recognition; Image processing; Image segmentation; Optical character recognition; Security systems; Template matching; Vehicles; And filters; Noise removal; Plate detections; Recognition; Registration number; Template matching method; Vehicle license plates; Vehicle number plate; License plates (automobile)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

If diabetes is not properly controlled for more than 8 years, the retinal blood vessels in the human eye are damaged. The eye pathologies due to the damage of the blood vessel in the retina cause diabetic retinopathy which is a severe eye disease leading to vision loss. The major symptoms for this disease are the exudates which are due to the leakage of lipids and proteins from the damaged blood vessels. To prevent the people suffering by diabetic retinopathy from the vision loss, this disease should be diagnosed in an earlier stage. The chemical solutions applied into the patient's eye for capturing dilated retinal images cause irritation to the human eye. So, the nondilated retinal images are collected for diagnosis from the STARE web database. The input retinal images are preprocessed and segmented by using Fuzzy C-means segmentation technique. The features are extracted by Gabor filter and the features are compared by Speeded UP Robust Features (SURF) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform SIFT algorithms.

This problem is more in ISM bands. Using licensed bands for industrial sensors and controllers by way of opportunistic spectrum access is being explored in the recent times. But searching by these wireless devices for the available vacant spectrum is a hectic task as many of these devices are very small and operate with limited computing powers. Hence in these kinds of environments it would be better if spectrum sensing task is carried out by more capable devices like access points and share it to all the surrounding tiny wireless devices. It will be more appropriate if the available vacant spectrum details can be obtained from a server like resource. It can alleviate the sensors from carrying out such hectic spectrum sensing activity.

We propose a novel learning framework for tracking multiple unknown objects in a video stream by detection. Proposed system tracks multiple objects in presence of occlusion, clutter and scaling. The object is defined by its location and extent in a single frame. The tracker follows the object from frame to frame. The detector localizes all appearances that have been seen so far and corrects the tracker if required. The learning estimates detectors errors and updates that in the future to avoid these errors. A novel learning method (P-N learning) which estimates the errors by a pair of experts: (i) P-expert observes missed detections, and (ii) N-expert observes false alarms. First, instead of heuristically defining a tracking algorithm, we discovered that a discriminative structure prediction model from labeled video data and capture the interdependence of multiple influence factors. In every next frame the aim is to calculate the location and extent of object or indicate that object is not present. There are different algorithms which perceive the object in real-time. This system proposes a model which uses template matching algorithm with modifications based on SURF algorithm and squared difference error method. The template matching is done based on comparison of image features. We develop a novel method of tracking based upon template tracking algorithm which crops the region of interest(ROI) from the selected live object from a video stream from trained object database.

There are many semi-Automated and automated approaches which are used to detect and segment individual vertebra from computed tomography (CT) images. But most of these approaches do not provide satisfactory results due to the anatomical similarities between the adjacent vertebrae and the effect of underlying artifacts. So to overcome these problems, a framework for individual vertebrae segmentation from CT images of spine is put forward.

As voltage control oscillator (VCO) is an important part of RF systems, following paper proposes a low power 30 GHz VCO. The preferred oscillator topology uses LC tank over ring oscillator because of its robust phase noise response. The proposed LC-VCO is validated through CAD simulation and shows a wide tuning range with lesser phase noise or power impact as compared to other proposed structures. The proposed LC-VCO is based on 90-nm CMOS process and consists of four MOS transistors and a LC-tank as the major constituents. The design has been kept simple so as to reduce the chip area and avoid any complex interconnect. Due to reduced load on the LC-tank achieved by the proposed structure, the power consumption recorded at a 1.8 V supply has was 0.38 mW. The achieved tuning range of the proposed system was 17%, and the phase noise was -105 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.

Recovery of the image from its noisy atmosphere is also an area of interest in this paper. Our method aims at the extraction process of local and global impression of a given image by giving priority to image denoising also. We propose a gradient-based segmenting adherity property of the segmented image. We also show this as an efficient method to achieve the regularity and adherence property of the segmented image. Since we are dealing with marker controlled Watershed transformation technique, the problem of over-segmentation can be avoided to a great extreme. Partial-Thresholding to smoothness and preservation of better image details can be also seen in this work. Better PSNR, MSNR and correlation parameter can be achieved through wavelet thresholding. Here, we try to showcase 'markerpixels' as an efficient tool for the creation of superpixels using Watershed transformation and also wavelet transformation process for denoised waterpixel segments. Thus a combination of wavelet based-controlled watershed segmentation can be seen through this work. Soft-Thresholding and hard-Thresholding are used for image denoising.

The scenes which are captured have a number of objects along with the object of interest. of all these objects, the ones which are not required are ignored or considered as the background. Consider applications like tracking and object identification, where the object of interest has to be identified. The computer vision system which captures these scene, has along with other objects, Object of interest and also their shadows. If only the object of interest is considered then its shadow having a shape almost similar to that of the object and further if the object is dark then the matching is at shape as well as colour level. There are always chances that the tracking and the object identification system which works on colour and shape, may detect the shadow in place of the object. This is called as false tracking or false detection respectively. The limitations of the computer vision system is that it cannot differentiate between the objects and its shadows, so a preprocessing stage has to be introduced between the computer vision system and processing stage called as the shadow detection and elimination system.

High resolution algorithms for DOA estimation have been widely used in applications like SONAR, RADAR and wireless communications to resolve closely-situated sources. However these algorithms are very sensitive to the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the number of snapshots and correlation between sources. The DOA estimation problem can be viewed as a sparse representation problem as the signals impinging on an array are intrinsically sparse in the spatial domain. Hence compressed sensing techniques can be applied in DOA estimation. This paper explores the formulation of the DOA estimation as a sparse representation problem and compares the performance of different compressive beamforming techniques. Compressive beamforming is done using 11 minimization and greedy algorithms. It is shown that greedy algorithms are faster than 11 minimization. An improvement to greedy algorithm is proposed in this paper so that prior information about sparsity is not needed. Resolution is further improved using multiband signals. Thus the study shows that compressive beamforming can give 2 to 3 degree resolution from single snapshot which is better than existing methods. © 2016 IEEE.","11 minimization; Compressed sensing; Compressive beamforming; Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","Acoustic fields; Beamforming; Compressed sensing; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Beamforming technique; Direction of arrivalestimation(DOA); Greedy algorithms; High resolution algorithm; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Prior information; Sparse representation; Wireless communications; Direction of arrival",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033492,,,"English","Int.

Melanoma skin cancers are also known as malignant melanoma. Recent studies show that the death rates of melanoma patients depend on the various stages of cancer, so early detection and treatment of melanoma implicate higher chances of cure. Now most of the existing skin lesion analysis system use ABCDE parameters for feature extraction. But these methods have lot of drawbacks. In this paper an advance earlier melanoma detection algorithm is proposed using colour correlogram and texture analysis.

Hence early detection is the most promising way to improve the patient's chance for survival from lung cancer. The most common technique used to examine the lung cancer is Posterior and Anterior chest radiography and computerized tomography scans. PA chest radiography is the cost effective tool in diagnosing lung tumors. But interpreting chest radio graph is difficult because of superimposed anatomical structure present in the image. Even experienced radiologist facing difficult in finding abnormalities in the X-ray image. Different Computer Aided Diagnosis system proposed in the literature to help the radiologists in finding abnormalities from X-Ray images, but none showed perfect result because of complex anatomical structure present in the image and subtlety of the nodule. In this paper three methods are proposed to find tumor from PA chest radio graphic images. All the three methods are developed and tested on standard database available on Japanese society of radiological Technology and images available on web. In the first method tumor part delineated from the image with the help of different morphological operations and mask, then various features are obtained from the segmented tumor. In the second method suspicious nodule regions are found by applying multi scale blob detection method and to reduce number of false positives threshold method is employed. For further reduction of false positives and to detect potential nodule SVM classifier is used. In the third method lung part of the image is divided in to patches of fixed size. Patch contain potential nodule found by using Restricted Boltzmann machine and SVM classifier. Here Restricted Boltzmann is used for finding the features from patch (region of interest), ROI is classified as nodule (or) non-nodule by using linear SVM classifier. © 2016 IEEE.","computer aided diagnosis (CAD); Morphological operations; Mutiscale Blob Detection; Potential nodule; Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)","Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Radiography; Tumors; X ray analysis; X ray radiography; Blob detection; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Morphological operations; Potential nodule; Restricted boltzmann machine; Computer aided diagnosis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041718,,,"English","FTC - Proc.

Expert's manual segmentation not only relies on just intensity information available with the image because human vision system roughly relies on intensity but at the same time, it reads local information too. Hence, an attempt has been made, where local properties such as phase, energy and amplitude were extracted from the gray scale image using monogenic signals. Here, the monogenic signals were constructed using Cauchy functions rather than traditional Log Gabor function. Active contour based segmentation that incorporates distance regularized level set evolution concept has been used to segment the region of interest on the local information based image i.e Phase Based Distance Regularized Level Set. Proposed method utilizes local phase and feature asymmetry in achieving the objective. Robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated with the quantitative metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) index, Hausdorff Distance (HD) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) measures.

Thus Network on chips (NoCs) has provided reliable and scalable solution for communication across cores which mostly use mesh topologies. But 2D NoCs faces the issue of increase in the network diameter which introduces area and power constraints. Thus 3D NoCs has been introduced which provides an alternate interconnect technology and uses the benefits of both NoCs and 3D ICs. 3D NoCs although sustains the performance and growth of increased cores integration but suffer from the issue of faults due to heterogeneous cores integration on different layers, fabrication defects, power saving schemes, component failures etc. which may lead to irregular architecture. Thus to provide efficient routing for such irregular architecture of 3D NoCs is a challenge. This paper extends the capabilities of Segment Routing algorithm by providing formal model for irregular 3D NoCs to enhance its fault tolerance. The Segment Routing is topological agnostic and workable for 2D and 3D meshes but is inefficient for irregular 3D NoCs. The paper extends the concept of segmentation to introduce new segments in Segment Routing algorithm and handles 3D faults using bidirectional turn restrictions. The validation of a Topology Agnostic Routing Algorithm using Segmentation Strategy (TARAS) is performed using theorems which provides concrete definitions to satisfy essential properties of 3D NoCs and enables efficient fault tolerant routing in irregular 3D NoCs. © 2016 IEEE.","3D Network on Chip; fault; interconnects; routing; segment","Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Distributed computer systems; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Faulting; Image segmentation; Integrated circuit interconnects; Network architecture; Optical interconnects; Routers; Routing algorithms; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Topology; 3D networks; Component failures; Fabrication defects; Fault tolerant routing; Heterogeneous cores; Interconnect technology; routing; segment; Network-on-chip","Mitra, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: priyanka.mitra.vit@gmail.com","Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The need of change in radiation parameters of an antenna like frequency, polarization, radiation pattern or combination of these parameters, on board had given rise to design reconfigurable antennas. This reconfiguration on antenna is achieved by switching feed location of an antenna or switching ground or switching the radiating path of an antenna which brings change in the effective resonating length. The switching can be done by using PIN diodes, varactor diodes, optical switches and MEMS to connect/disconnect different parts on an antenna. Due to this the total antenna volume of printed reconfigurable antenna can be reused to achieve different antenna modes. Thus, printed reconfigurable antenna integrates functional diversities to accommodate the increasing demands of modern wireless applications like software defined radio, cognitive radio, fading, noise interference, MIMO with a small form factor. © 2016 IEEE.","DGS; frequency reconfigurable; pattern reconfigurable; pin diodes; polarization reconfigurable; RF switches; slots; varactor diodes","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive radio; Diodes; Fading (radio); Microstrip antennas; MIMO systems; MOEMS; Optical switches; Polarization; Semiconductor diodes; Software radio; Switching; Varactors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Pattern-reconfigurable; PiN diode; Reconfigurable; RF switch; slots; Varactor diodes; Directional patterns (antenna)",,"Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509010479,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

This has led to implement wireless technology/ system for medical applications. Accordingly researches are going on to use wireless technologies for different purposes of rehabilitation. The present work uses a wireless night vision camera for gaze tracking of the patient for 24×7 support eliminating the use of cables/ wires and thus reducing the chances of infections and other hazardous. The camera along with a power supply (battery) serves as a standalone unit for ready deployment. The control computer can be set up at a distance even out of the cabin and helps the physiotherapists and healthcare staffs to monitor and assist several patients remotely at a time. The experiments have been carried out in both day and night with users wearing spectacles or no spectacles. Promising results have been obtained in spite of several issues of data loss, IR glaring etc. Several applications of wireless technologies have been attempted, but use of such approach has never been tried earlier.

The demand for an easy, comfortable and patient friendly solution for acquisition, processing and remotely transmitting the information from patient to the healthcare centre is increasing day by day. Although few existing techniques are available like the Holter Monitoring and ECG [more than 1-lead] these test are specialized and available in the hospitals/healthcare centres only. While in urban India people do not have time for regular Health checkups, in rural India the lack of awareness towards subdued cardiac pathologies coupled with few available health centres has led to a significant rise in cardiovascular diseases and deaths in the last few decades. Investigations for heart related ailments are still confined to the Electrocardiogram (ECG), Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) Sensor and the Phonocardiogram (PCG). The digital recordings are made by the machines but the data is still saved usually via print formats and analyzed manually by specialists. The aim of this study is to design a solution to the problem via our unique Cardio-Sensor Aggregation Platform (CSAP) for monitoring, storage and diagnosis of the cardiac bio-signals in real-time. The objective was to design the Cardio-Sensor Aggregation Platform (CSAP) in order to capture the data (ECG, Pulse Rate and Heart Sound) in real-time and transmit the same from the CSAP to any mobile device running the application, by using wireless communication technology. The CSAP captures the patient's physiological parameters transforming the signal using custom adaptive filtering which is transferred to the mobile platform for further processing. The data is processed by the smart mobile device and any imminent/ urgent response is given back to the user.

Unlike existing approaches that use content of handwriting for fraud/forged document identification, in this paper we propose a novel approach that explores the quality of handwritten documents by considering both foreground and background information to identify whether it is old or new. The proposed approach works based on the fact that if a fraud document is created with some gaps after the original one, the fraud document happened to be a new one and the original happened to be an old one in this work. To identify whether a given handwritten document is old or new with gaps, we propose to divide Fourier coefficients of the input image into positive and negative coefficient images, and then reconstruct respective images to conquer two reconstructed ones. The contrast of the reconstructed images obtained before and after divide-conquer is studied to analyze the ages of the document based on image quality. The proposed approach finds a unique relationship between reconstructed images, obtained before and after divide-conquer, to identify the input image as old or new. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on our own handwritten dataset and a standard database, namely, Google-LIFE magazine. Comparative studies with the existing approaches show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches in terms of classification rate. © 2016 IEEE.","Divide and conquer; Document aging; Forged document; Fourier coefficients; Fraud document","Character recognition; Crime; Fourier analysis; Fourier transforms; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Waveform analysis; Background information; Divide and conquer; Document identification; Forged document; Fourier coefficients; Fraud document; Handwritten document; Positive and negative coefficients; Information retrieval systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21676445,9781509009817,,,"English","Proc.

Wireless sensor systems are outfitted with minor, essential batteries and along these lines it is important to plan vitality effective calculations to draw out the system lifetime. In remote sensor systems (WSNs), the sink versatility along an obliged mode can enhance the vitality proficiency. Sink mobility is an imperative method to enhance sensor system execution including vitality utilization, end-To-end delay and lifetime. To manage the above issues researches introduced a Rendezvous design technique, where some sensor nodes are selected as an RP's and the nodes which are not RP's will forward data to the nearest RP's. The major issue in this design is to find the set of RP's and determine the tour that visits these RP's. To overcome this issue in this paper we proposed an algorithm called as an "" Weighted Rendezvous Planning(WRP)"" , where each node is provided with some weight based on the number of packets that it sends and the nearest hop distance.

These both backgrounds are defined as a mixture of Gaussian model, it uses online Bayesian for updating. Two binary foregrounds are extracted by subtracting those backgrounds from current frame. Then shadow removing algorithms are applied to extract the real shape of the foreground objects. Then blob level likelihood image model is used to detect temporary static objects. Then we classify the extracted object using features like size, height, width, colour of that object. Input to this is video and the output will be detection and classification of abandoned objects.

Especially in the field of surveillance system it has gained greater significance than ever before due to the recent terror activities taking place all over the world. Many efforts have been made to make the system automated in order to decrease the complexity and to increase the ease with which it can be implemented. The paper describes the implementation of Object Detection and Tracking for the surveillance system on DSP board Embest Dev Kit 8500D using Modified Background Subtraction algorithm. The camera used in the system, Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000 camera, operates at a speed of 30fps. The DSP board acts as a standalone system with Linux based Angstrom Operating System (OS) installed in it and it is programmed in C++ language integrated with OpenCV library. Contrary to the conventional Background Subtraction algorithm where a fixed reference frame is subtracted from incoming frame, Frame Differencing technique is used in this paper in which two consecutive frames are subtracted from one another to remove the stationary background. The design is successfully implemented to detect and track the object with a minimum time delay. © 2016 IEEE.","Angstrom OS; DSP embest dev kit; Grayscale conversion; Microsoft lifecam HD 3000 camera; Modified background subtraction; OpenCV","C++ (programming language); Cameras; Computer operating systems; Digital signal processing; Image segmentation; Monitoring; Motion compensation; Navigation systems; Object recognition; Real time control; Robots; Security systems; Time delay; Tracking (position); Background subtraction; DSP embest dev kit; Gray scale; MicroSoft; OpenCV; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The main drawbacks in the conventional communication techniques are low spectral efficiency, lack of high rate, interferences, etc. The OFDM communication model overcomes the drawbacks of conventional communicational model and offers the high data rate, and high spectral efficiency. Although OFDM has many advantages over FDM but it suffers from inter carrier interference and inter symbol interference when multiple carriers are used and due to this interferences loss of Orthogonality happens, in order to overcome these interferences usage of cyclic prefix has become mandatory. But usage of cyclic prefix shows huge negative impact on bandwidth efficiency as the cyclic prefix approach consumes nearly 20% of bandwidth and BER performance too affected by CP. In this paper a novel wavelet based OFDM model is presented which is mainly intended to provide good Orthogonality and better spectral efficiency using various modulation techniques, the unique thing in the usage of wavelet based OFDM is it does not need the cyclic prefix, CP decreases bandwidth efficiency. But wavelet increases bandwidth and when bandwidth increases simultaneously spectral efficiency increases. Finally the usage of the wavelet based OFDM shows improved BER over conventional FDM communication model. The simulation results indicates the usage of wavelet based OFDM in place of Fourier based OFDM in wireless system and finally the comparison between wavelet based OFDM and DFT based OFDM. In this paper for simulation purpose Additive white Gaussian noise channel (indoor channel) and Stanford University Interim (SUI) channels are used. Here Sanford University channel works like outdoor channel. In every channel and for every modulation scheme wavelet gives improved Bit Error Rate. © 2016 IEEE.","BER; Cyclic prefix; ICI and ISI; OFDM; Spectral efficiency","Bandwidth; Bit error rate; Decoding; Efficiency; Error statistics; Gaussian noise (electronic); Information theory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Modulation; Wavelet analysis; White noise; Wireless telecommunication systems; Additive white Gaussian noise channel; Communication techniques; Cyclic Prefix; High-speed communications; ICI and ISI; Inter carrier interference; Spectral efficiencies; Wireless communication system; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Since the shadows are connected to the object and move along with it, false object detection may occur in addition to the problem of false connectivity and loss of background texture. Hence shadow detection is an important preprocessing step for a robust visual surveillance system. However, the conventional methods which usually use a static threshold over the color and/or intensity channels for shadow detection may fail when some object regions have properties identical to the cast shadow (fake shadow). In this paper, we present a novel shadow detection and removal scheme which can effectively deal with the problem of fake shadows using the HOG (histogram-of-oriented gradients) features. In the initial stage of moving object detection we make use of GMM (Gaussian mixture model) to properly segment the foreground regions. Since HSV color space gives a better separation of chromaticity and intensity, it helps to detect the shadows in the segmented foreground but at the same time may also misclassify some object regions as shadow regions. We exploit the fact that these object regions (misclassified regions/fake shadows) change the entire background information as compared to the cast shadows which mostly cause intensity variations over the background and perform a local feature matching process to properly identify the real shadow and fake shadow regions. Once the regions are identified it becomes easy to remove the shadows without any loss of information in the object regions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves good results in outdoor scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.","Fake shadow; GMM; HOG; HSV color space; Local features","Chemical detection; Color; Feature extraction; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Object recognition; Fake shadow; Gmm (gaussian mixture model); Histogram of oriented gradients; HSV color spaces; Local feature; Moving object detection and tracking; Shadow detection and removals; Visual surveillance systems; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The 4th Generation (4G) wireless network standardized as Long Term Evolution (LTE) utilizes advantages Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), where each cell of the network uses same frequency band, i.e Frequency Reuse equal to '1'.

In fact, the deployment of the antenna in wireless network faces the grave challenges of the communication of the high speed signals. Of late, the Nanoantennas make their elegant presence in several spheres of the technology. However, it is highly essential, at present, to have an overall awareness for the purpose of a balanced design of Nanoantenna switch broadband feedbacks. These days, many techniques are doing its elegant rounds invested in examining the spectral features of the LPTCNA by the excitation method of incident and discharge. The field improvement of the Nano antenna can be harmonized by several geometric constraints including the Outer Radius, bow angle, Tooth angle, and the ratio of the radial sizes of consecutive teeth, which furnish effective check on the spectral resonance position and the field renovation. Taking the challenges in to consideration, a novel hybrid ABC0-PSO optimization approach is launched in the document, which involves a gifted prospect for planning and adapting the log periodic Nano-Antenna.

The antenna can be used for various combinations of wireless applications such as Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, 3G within a microwave L, S, C and X frequency bands in Electromagnetic Spectrum. Now days, different antennas are preferred/devised for different wireless applications. The increased complexity and the size of the device are the major issues.

This process is called co-registration. In this work we will discuss a three step procedure to prepare raw MRI data for co-registration. The primary requirement from the brain MR images is the extraction of the cortical surface of the brain. In order to perform cortical surface extraction, the acquired MR images are pre-processed to strip unwanted components, remove noise and avoid partial volume effect. This is achieved with the application of a skull stripping method based on hole-filling, dilation and erosion followed by anisotropic diffusion based filtering of the skull stripped images.

Vedic is one of the efficient multipliers. Design of Vedic multiplier using different sutras reduces area and power. From the structure of Vedic multiplier, it is clearly observed that there is scope to design an efficient architecture. In this research, Vedic multiplier is designed using modified full adder which consumes less number of LUT's, slices and delay when compared to normal conventional Vedic multiplier.

Telecom operators are considering small cells and Wi-Fi for handling this huge traffic demand. As User Equipments (UEs) are typically associated with a near-by cell (eNB), spatio-temporal variation in traffic demands makes the LTE networks suffer from load imbalance problem. Due to the distributed nature of eNB operation in LTE Radio Access Network (RAN), traditional solutions to tackle load imbalance problem could lead to excessive overhead over X2 interface. Hence, managing densely deployed cells is very challenging in the existing distributed LTE RAN. In this work, load imbalance issue is addressed by proposing a centralized Software Defined LTE RAN (SD-LTE-RAN) framework and a novel QoS Aware Load Balance (QALB) algorithm. For taking load balance decisions, the QALB algorithm considers loads of neighbor cells, QoS profiles of UEs and their expected throughputs w.r.t. neighbor cells. Unlike existing load balance algorithms, it does not change handover-offset parameters of cells to avoid ping pong handovers. The proposed framework and QALB algorithm are implemented in NS-3 simulator. In various load balance scenarios, proposed QALB algorithm is able to maintain better QoS data rates (> 80% of their configured Guaranteed Bit Rates (GBRs)) for more than 70% of the cells in the network. While existing load balance algorithms are able to do the same for only 50% of the cells in the network. In overall, the QALB algorithm is able to decrease the total network overload by 15% compared to existing load balance algorithms. We also evaluated the QALB algorithm in mobility scenarios and identified that it is able to decrease average network overload by 10% compared to existing load balance algorithms. To evaluate the network wide fair load distribution, we defined load balance index (LBI) using Jain's Fairness Index. © 2016","Load balance; LTE; OpenFlow; Priority scheduler; QoS; RAN; SDN","Cells; Cytology; Distributed computer systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Quality of service; Expected throughput; Guaranteed bit rate; Load balance; Load balance algorithm; Openflow; Priority scheduler; Radio access networks; Spatio-temporal variation; Wireless telecommunication systems","Rangisetti, A.K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology HyderabadIndia; email: cs12p1001@iith.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01403664,,COCOD,,"English","Comput Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994504756

Li-Fi as opposed to Radio waves in Wi-Fi uses Visible Light for bringing about the communication between two devices. This paper throws light on how Light (VLC) is a feasible solution to the existing problems of radio waves with some useful insights on Li-Fi and how it can improve indoor data transfers and communication. The whole concept originated with the advent of the VLC i.e Visible Light Communication. The idea here is to think out of the radio bandwidth which we are so used to, that we actually use it in 99% of all our wireless communication, but the scenario is changing as Radio waves have some disadvantages like interference, low bandwidth etc. that need a thoughtful update or entire replacement, if need be, this is where the VLC comes in for the rescue. If we look at the electromagnetic spectrum we can see how small the bandwidth of Radio waves is and that there are still wide range of frequencies that we can use, in this case the Visible Light which falls between the ranges 350nm-750nm wavelength. Li-Fi uses this band of frequencies for bringing about the communication between two devices. Hence Li-Fi can effectively share the burden on current Wi-Fi and eventually replace it in many indoor places like Hospitals, Military bases, Offices etc. © 2017 IEEE.","Light Emitting Diodes; Light Fidelity (Li-Fi); Radio Waves; Visible Light Communication; Wireless Communications","Bandwidth; Data transfer; Light; Light emitting diodes; Radio waves; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Electromagnetic spectra; Existing problems; Feasible solution; Indoor communications; Light fidelity (Li Fi); Radio bandwidth; Wireless communications; Wireless fidelities; Visible light communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Classification systems are being used by doctors to analyse and diagnose the medical data. Radial basis function neural networks are more attractive for classification of diseases, especially in diabetes classification, because of it’s non iterative nature. Radial basis function neural networks are four layer feed forward neural network with input layer, pattern layer, summation layer and the decision layer respectively. The size of the pattern layer increases on par with training data set size. Though various attempts have made to solve this issue by clustering input data using different clustering algorithms like k-means, k-medoids, and SOFM etc. However main difficulty of determining the optimal number of neurons in the pattern layer remain unsolved. In this paper, we present a new model based on cluster validity index with radial basis neural network for classification of diabetic patients data. We employ cluster validity index in class by class fashion for determining the optimal number of neurons in pattern layer. A new convex fitness function has also been designed for bat inspired optimization algorithm to identify the weights between summation layer and pattern layer. The proposed model for radial basis function neural network is tested on Pima Indians Diabetes data set and synthetic data sets. Experimental results proved that our approach performs better in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, classification time, training time, network complexity and computational time compared to conventional radial basis function neural network. It is also proved that proposed model performs better compared to familiar classifiers namely probabilistic neural network, feed forward neural network, cascade forward network, time delay network, artificial immuine system and GINI classifier. © 2017, the Authors.","Bat Algorithm; Classification; Diabetes; Medical diagnosis; Optimal number of clusters; Radial Basis Function Networks","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Computer aided diagnosis; Conformal mapping; Diagnosis; Functions; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Medical problems; Network layers; Neural networks; Optimization; Time delay; Two phase flow; Bat algorithms; Cluster validity indices; Optimal number; Optimization algorithms; Pima indians diabetes data sets; Probabilistic neural networks; Radial basis function neural networks; Radial basis neural networks; Radial basis function networks","Cheruku, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology GoaIndia; email: rmlswamygoud@nitgoa.ac.in",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",18756891,,,,"English","Int.

It is one of the most complex and demanding tasks in image processing. Image segmentation is the process of separating an image into various regions such that each region is identical. This paper proposes a new medical image segmentation method that integrates multi-resolution wavelet packet decomposition with the watershed transform for MRI image. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied to the input image, creating detail and approximation coefficients. If watershed technique alone is used for segmentation, then over cluster is present. To overcome this, the proposed technique which combines wavelet packet and watershed algorithm is developed. First, the wavelet packet transform is applied to produce multi-resolution images, followed by applying watershed for segmentation to the approximation sub-bands. Finally, Inverse WPT is implemented to obtain the segmented image. Due to wavelet packet decomposition, the quantity of the disturbance can be decreased and leads to a tough segmentation. This proposed work concludes that wavelet packet and watershed transform facilitate to get the elevated precision even in strident images. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Watershed algorithm; Wavelet packet transform","Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Watersheds; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Approximation coefficients; Hybrid segmentation; Multiresolution images; Multiresolution wavelets; Water-shed algorithm; Wavelet Packet Decomposition; Wavelet packet transform(WPT); Wavelet packet transforms; Image segmentation","Rajmohan, K.; Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Annamalai UniversityIndia; email: ggtt_me@yahoo.com","Tyagi V.Grosky W.Gupta P.K.Oren T.Singh M.Sharma A.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811054266,,,"English","Commun.

With the increase in demand of digital wireless communications in commercial and personal networks judicious use of frequency spectrum has become a serious concern for wireless engineers. Cognitive adios (CR) are a solution to this clustered spectrum issue nowadays. Cognitive radio or SDR is a new concept/ technology which is being implemented to maximize the utilization of radio spectrum. At any time, unused frequency spectrum can be sensed by cognitive radio from the wide range of wireless radio spectrum. So, as a result this gives really an efficient utilization of radio resources. Major factors that govern cognitive radio network (CRN) are related to service contradiction, routing, and jamming attacks which may interfere with other operating wireless technologies. Thrust areas in developing a good CR lies in the efficient algorithm design for spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, and radio re-configurability.

Due to the problems faced by traditional OCR during recognition, computer is unable to extract the textual characters properly after scanning them. In this paper, we propose an effective word extraction and matching scheme from image documents that achieves high performance, even in the presence of noise in the image, degradation and font-variants. Initially, each image in image-database is pre-processed. In the next step, find contour method is used to detect blobs which are further passed in tesseract engine. Tesseract segments the characters from the image and stores in character database. Each word in the database is used to index a given set of images. During retrieval, the query word presented to the system is matched with characters in the database and all images containing instances of the query word are retrieved and presented to the user. Using this approach, our system is able to properly handle images with different font styles, size and heavily touching characters. From the experimental results on the various image formats it is observed that the extraction of text from the images is mostly accurate and indexing of words based on the position is working perfectly. © 2017 IEEE.","Document image analysis; Indexing; OpenCV; Pre-processing; Segmentation; Tesseract Engine","Database systems; Digital libraries; Engines; Extraction; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Optical character recognition; Query processing; Character database; Digital image data; Document image analysis; OpenCV; Optical character recognition (OCR); Pre-processing; Tesseract; Touching character; Search engines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

In proposed method, an equiripple low pass finite impulse response (FIR) filter is designed to suppress the dominance of blood vessels and to enhance the OD region in retinal image. Desired frequency response with optimized order of the filter is achieved by choosing proper values of filter design parameters. This method computes the appropriate value of threshold to locate the OD in retinal image. Segmentation of the OD region is carried out using grayscale morphological dilation and median filtering operation. The proposed algorithm has been tested on four standard databases (DRIVE, DIRATEDB0, DIRATEDB1 and DRIONS database). The proposed algorithm detects the OD successfully with accuracies 100%, 96.92%, 98.98%, 100% on DRIVE, DIRATEDB0, DIRATEDB1 and DRIONS databases respectively. The OD segmentation sensitivity and specificity are in the range of 74.60–87.07%, 99.39–99.61% on these four databases. The proposed algorithm has low computation complexity as it takes low computation time to segment the OD over existing methods. Also it is robust to differences in image illumination and retinal anomalies. Hence the proposed method can be used for automatic screening system of retinal related diseases like glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Diabetic retinopathy; Equiripple low pass FIR filter; Optic disk; Retinal images","Blood vessels; Database systems; Diagnosis; Eye protection; FIR filters; Frequency response; Impulse response; Low pass filters; Median filters; Ophthalmology; Automatic segmentations; Computation complexity; Diabetic retinopathy; Low-pass; Morphological dilation; Optic disks; Retinal image; Sensitivity and specificity; Image segmentation; Article; automation; diabetic retinopathy; filter design; filtering operation; glaucoma; human; illumination; image segmentation; measurement accuracy; optic disk; predictive value; priority journal; retina blood vessel; retina image; sensitivity and specificity",,,"Elsevier Ltd",17468094,,,,"English","Biomed.

The major research concerns in the existing multiuser overloaded CDMA schemes are (i) statistically uncorrelated PN sequences that cause multiple-access interference (MAI) and (ii) the security of the user’s data. In this paper, a novel grouped CDMA scheme, the 1D-Bernoulli chaotic collaborative CDMA (BCC-CDMA), is introduced, in which mutually orthogonal chaotic sequences spread the users’ data within a group.The synchronization ofmultiple groups in this scheme has been analyzed under MAI limited environments and the results are presented.This increases the user capacity and also provides sufficient security as a result of the correlation properties possessed by the chaotic codes.

Then, the sink will collect more interference because of the slow-fading of signal, due to this, a higher outage probability and high energy consumption occurs. Underwater wireless communication is quite difficult because of the factors like propagation delay, small available bandwidth, strong signal attenuation, and interference from natural and man-made acoustic interferences. In underwater wireless acoustic communication all these factors depend on the frequency and distance. Higher frequency defines the worst case in terms of power consumption, and in terms of battery lifetime of the network. So in this work, we consider optimal distance between transmit nodes and receiver node to enhance the performance. The optimal power control schemes has been proposed in underwater wireless networks, of which the principle thought is to utilize distinctive power levels for enhancing the performance. By using this scheme, we get reduction of outage probability and enhancement of transmission capacity.

The main objective is to allocate first all GBR bearers because of their highest quality-of service (QoS) requirements. After the resource allocation of GBR bearers, if the current transit time interval (TTI) has more resources, then the packets of non-GBR bearers are entertained.

This huge volume of data storage and transfer is a challenging task, particularly when lower level microcomputers are employed as field devices. The increased computational burden of entropy based compression algorithms and requirement of the probability distribution of symbols makes it difficult to implement for data acquisition. Differential Binary Encoded Algorithm (DBEA) gives a high compression ratio with repetitive, slow varying data array. But it is not suitable for the GSM communication scheme where printable character transmission is possible. An improved algorithm, Modified DBEA (M-DBEA) is developed which not only extends the range of DBEA but also gives a character string containing printable characters only. The results obtained by M-DBEA with practical data values are encouraging and thus implemented at the microcontroller level to develop a handshaking based compressed temperature data transfer system using Arduino UNO microcontrollers. When suitable sensors are used, it is possible to extend the work to develop a smart data management system for compressing real time parameter values collected over the finite time duration and transmit the compressed information through any suitable wired or wireless communication scheme. © 2018 AMSE Presse.

VANET is an enhanced form of the Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). The IEEE 802.11standard is based on CSMA/CD and used in both MANET and VANET. An enhanced version IEEE 802.11p is developed for VANET. VANET is a special type of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS), where the mobile nodes are cars, two wheelers, trucks, buses etc., that move on well organized and predefined roads in both the directions at a very high speed. For following the traffic rules, the vehicles provide communication with each other directly (Inter Vehicle Communication-IVC) or indirectly through the Road Side Unit (RSU). Usually thevehicles, which move outside the city area, do not get the response from the RSUas its availability is limited in that area. An attempt has been made to create a new clustering concept for this purpose, which can be applied to a newly created Simple High Way Mobility Model, to increase the speed of the vehicle communication. Thus, this paper focuses the performance of the Packet Delivery Time, Packet Delay Time, Throughput and end to end delay using IEEE 802.11p.

This requires their design to be based on some kind of reconfigurable techniques. Also, in cognitive applications, intelligent bandwidth allocation for efficient spectrum utilization requires altering the bandwidth within the same communication channel. Digital filters with non-uniform and varying bandwidths can be used to channelize different frequencies. Efficient designs of such filters are proposed in this paper. Frequency response masking (FRM)-based design is used, where the masking filters can be tuned to a desired set of frequencies by using a variable bandwidth (VBW) digital filter, configured as Farrow structure. For each of the chosen bandwidth, a corresponding masking filter response can be obtained, using the Farrow structure. A novel extension of FRM is proposed in this paper, using two approaches, to realize more than one sharp filter response from the same prototype linear-phase low-pass filter. In both approaches, the masking filters of the FRM filter are realized using Farrow structure. In the first approach, only a set of two Farrow structure filters are required to realize all the required channels. The channel selection is then carried out by varying a single parameter on each of the two masking filters. In the second approach, every channel is realized using a set of two Farrow structure filters and the channel is selected by means of hardware switching techniques. In addition to reconfigurability, hardware implementation complexity of Farrow structure-based VBW is lower compared to the direct FIR filter structure when designed for large set of bandwidths. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Farrow structure; Frequency response masking (FRM); Interpolation; Reconfigurable; Variable bandwidth filter","Bandpass filters; Bandwidth; Computer hardware; Digital filters; FIR filters; Frequency response; Hardware; Interpolation; Speech recognition; Wireless telecommunication systems; Farrow structure; Frequency response masking; Hardware implementations; Intelligent bandwidth; Reconfigurable; Spectrum utilization; Variable bandwidths; Wireless communication system; Low pass filters","Haridas, N.; Department of ECE, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: nisha_p120093ec@nitc.ac.in",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009726765

With the use of higher bands and increased access point density, terrestrial wireless communication systems are encountering more and more line-of-sight conditions than systems of earlier era. Moreover modern era of communication systems is generally designed to adapt transmission parameters dynamically. Such adaptations are done based on estimation of channel statistics. The measure of line-of-sight (Rician K-factor) is one of such statistics. It plays a vital role in estimating fade statistics, which influences the bit error rate, spectral efficiency, level crossing rate, average fade duration and so on. These factors significantly influence design of communication systems. This paper focuses on analytical computation of Rician K-factor of multi-clustered propagation channel models including antenna gain-patterns. Rician K-factor in different wireless channel models, which are based on the indoor channel model given by Saleh and Valenzuela and the channel model for IEEE 802.11ad standard have been calculated and compared with simulations. We show that, channel model provided explicit Rician factor does not agree with actual K-factor experienced by a link when details such as directivity of clusters and antenna gains are considered. The difference results in erroneous estimate of system performance. It is seen that the estimates of the required signal to noise ratio per bit for a given modulation and coding schemes can be affected by as much as 4 dB in sub 6 GHz systems and as high as 5 dB for millimeter wave systems due to incorrect use of Rician K-factor for relevant links. Average channel capacity is affected by around 13% for high SNR links due to variation of Rician K-factor. © 2013 IEEE.","angle of arrival; angle of departure; antenna gains; line of sight; millimeter wave; MIMO; Multipath; Rician channel; Rician K-factor; time of arrival","Antennas; Bit error rate; Channel capacity; Error statistics; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Frequency bands; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Telecommunication links; Time of arrival; Wireless telecommunication systems; Angle of arrival; Angle of departures; Antenna gains; Line of Sight; Multipath; Rician channels; Rician k factors; Signal to noise ratio","Mukherjee, S.; G.

Exploring the whole room would prove to be extremely expensive in terms of both computing power and time. To address this issue, we demonstrate a fast algorithm to reduce the search space by identifying possible object locations as two classes, namely - Support Structures and Clutter. Support Structures are plausible object containers in a scene such as tables, chairs, sofas, etc. Clutter refers to places where there seem to be several objects but cannot be clearly distinguished. It can also be identified as unorganized regions which can be of interest for tasks such as robot grasping, fetching and placing objects. The primary contribution of this paper is to quickly identify potential object locations using a Support Vector Machine(SVM) learnt over the features extracted from the depth map and the RGB image of the scene, which further culminates into a densely connected Conditional Random Field(CRF) formulated over the image of the scene. The inference over the CRF leads to assignment of the labels - support structure, clutter, others to each pixel. There have been reliable outcomes even during challenging scenarios such as the support structures being far from the robot. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy and speed of the algorithm irrespective of alterations to camera angles, modifications to appearance change, lighting and distance from locations etc. Copyright © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The first cue draws special attention to regions with presence of discontinuities and is constructed by exploiting standard deviation, busyness and entropy measures on the input image and its intrinsic map. The second cue diminishes the chances of broken edge generation by utilizing a population-based global optimisation heuristic (Particle Swarm Optimization) to detect the final edges from highlighted regions of the former cue.

In CoMP joint processing (JP) scheme multiple base stations (BSs) are coordinately transmit data streams to each user. As more than two base stations are involved, abundant spatial resources are exploited and more backhaul spectrum for JP cooperation is required. The backhaul architecture for CoMP JP is crucial to provide low latency, unlimited capacity, less power consumption, and perfect synchronization among the BSs. However, satisfying all these constraints is impossible as the number of cooperative BSs increases for each user. In this paper, a dynamic cooperative base station selection scheme is proposed to reduce the backhaul load for CoMP user by selecting the appropriate number of coordinated BSs from the CoMP cluster to ensure the certain quality of service (QoS). In particular, for cell edge user the number of cooperative BSs per user has been selected in order to achieve reduced overhead and the allocation of backhaul capacity is performed under the max–min fairness criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed selection scheme achieves significant performance improvement than other transmission modes in terms of the average sum rate per backhaul use and minimal total power consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Coordinated Multi-Point; Joint processing; Limited backhaul capacity; Non CoMP","4G mobile communication systems; Electric power utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Base station selection; Coordinated multi point (CoMP); Coordinated multi points; Joint processing; Limited backhauls; Non CoMP; Spectral efficiencies; Total power consumption; Base stations","Vijayarani, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Pondicherry Engineering CollegeIndia; email: vijee_er@pec.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981287266

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) yields a robust solution without the delineation and measurement of bones. This research work comprises of five major phases: Pre-processing, texture feature extraction, Relevance Score (RS) computation, bone age assessment and similarity matching. In the pre-processing phase, noise in the image samples is eliminated by making use of Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA). Texture Feature extraction is performed using Hybrid Local binary Patterns (HLBP), Epiphysis— Metaphysis Region of interest (ROI) (EMROI) feature extraction is introduced for the pre-processed image. With the aim of evaluating the bone age the Tanner-Whitehouse scheme was utilized to inspect 20 bones. For the computation of the similarity matching between query and input image samples, Discriminative Dictionary Learning (DDL) is introduced in the research work; it shows that DDL performs better when compared to other state-of the-art approaches. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Bone age assessment (BAA); Content based image retrieval (CBIR); Fuzzy neural network (FNN); Kernel fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA); Pre-processing; Similarity search","Binary images; Bins; Bone; Content based retrieval; Discriminant analysis; Engineering research; Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Fisher information matrix; Fuzzy neural networks; Image analysis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Bone age assessment; Content-Based Image Retrieval; Kernel fisher discriminant analysis; Pre-processing; Similarity search; Image retrieval","Jasmine, C.; Department of Computer Science, Quaid-E-Millath Govt.

Consequently, watermarking algorithms that involve embedding the patient report and finger print are proposed. In this method we are separating Region of Interest and Region of noninterest pixels from medical image using MATLAB. We have used RONI for adding watermark (patient report and fingerprint) to the medical cover image. In this paper we designed a new method to protect and authenticate medical images. We developed Independent Component Analysis on A Field programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and applied to RONI image that enables the addition of watermark.

The idea evolves as a reduction in duty cycle and precise time scheduling of active/sleep cycles of the sensors to reduce the probability of collisions between data and control packets which prolongs the network lifetime and reduces the average end to end delay. The multihop transmissions are not always attractive in underwater communication due to high losses. The proposed Slotted Cyclic Quorum with Influence nodes (SCQI) medium access control protocol is capable of continuous monitoring of critical underwater events in a very effective manner in multihop transmission networks. This work is an attempt to mitigate multihop hidden terminal and to reduce the probability of collisions between data and control packets. Methods: The mathematical model for the path loss due to attenuation of electromagnetic wave propagation in the sea water is explained. The three path reflection model evaluating reflection loss from the air-water and water-sand interfaces as a function of distance between sensors and water depth is introduced. It is assumed that the sensors are properly anchored to limit their movement due to waves within the permissible limits to follow the proposed cyclic quorum based medium access control protocol. The fundamentals of cyclic quorum with a slotted scheme along with the influence nodes are elaborated. This paper attempts to utilize electromagnetic waves at resonance frequency of 2.4 GHz for underwater communication. The main advantages of using electromagnetic waves instead of acoustic waves are that it reduces the latency due to faster propagation speed and give a high data rate due to high frequency of the wave at the cost of reduction in communication range. Results: The results verify that the implementation of cyclic quorum based medium access control (CQ) protocol, slotted cyclic quorum based medium access control (SCQ) protocol and slotted cyclic quorum based medium access control with influence nodes (SCQI) protocol has significantly reduced the average end to end delay with the increase in number of sensor nodes and also prolongs the network lifetime making it appropriate for critical and real time data monitoring. Conclusion: This work proves the suitability of electromagnetic waves as an effective alternative for underwater wireless communication. The main objective is to optimize the network lifetime and to reduce the average end to end delay by implementing cyclic quorum based medium access control protocol in underwater wireless sensor networks and to draw the attention of researchers in this area. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","2.4 GHz; Collisions; Influence nodes; Multihop hidden terminal; Slotted cyclic quorum; Underwater electromagnetic wave communication; Underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN)","Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustics; Air; Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Electromagnetic waves; Internet protocols; Monitoring; Phase interfaces; Seawater; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; 2.4 ghz; Collisions; Hidden terminal; Influence nodes; Slotted cyclic quorum; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Medium access control","Raina, V.; ECE, CET, Mody University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: vikasraina.raina04@gmail.com",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",22132759,,,,"English","Recent Pat.

The adoption of buffering over relay network outperforms and achieves better outage probability than the conventional relaying. In case of full duplex relaying (FDR) both transmission and reception are happening in same orthogonal channels, the increase in buffer length and higher delay deteriorates the system quality of service (QoS). To achieve both spectral efficiency and QoS, full duplex relay with the separate buffers for receiving and re-transmitting is proposed. The optimal trusted relay selection scheme is incorporated for maximising the security with effective signal-to-interference and noise ratio, which significantly improves the relaying transmission and further Tabu search-based metaheuristic algorithm is used for dealing with the trusted relay selection problem. The performance of three models, i.e., FDR without buffer-aided (conventional FDR), FDR with general buffer and FDR with specific buffer is investigated and compared in terms of outage probability and throughput. The simulation results revealed that the proposed FDR with specific buffer-aided scheme provides better performance compared with other FDR methods.

Since the shadows are connected to the object and move along with it, false object detection may occur in addition to the problem of false connectivity and loss of background texture. Hence shadow detection is an important preprocessing step for a robust visual surveillance system. However, the conventional methods which usually use a static threshold over the color and/or intensity channels for shadow detection may fail when some object regions have properties identical to the cast shadow (fake shadow). In this project, we present a novel shadow detection and removal scheme which can effectively deal with the problem of fake shadows using the HOG (Histogram-of-Oriented Gradients) features. In the initial stage of moving object detection we make use of GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) to properly segment the foreground regions. Since HSV color space gives a better separation of chromaticity and intensity, it helps to detect the shadows in the segmented foreground but at the same time may also misclassify some object regions as shadow regions. We exploit the fact that these object regions (misclassified regions/fake shadows) change the entire background information as compared to the cast shadows which mostly cause intensity variations over the background and perform a local feature matching process to properly identify the real shadow and fake shadow regions. Once the regions are identified it becomes easy to remove the shadows without any loss of information in the object regions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves good results in outdoor scenarios. © 2017 IEEE.","Euclidean distance; Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); Histogram-of-Oriented Gradients (HOG)","Chemical detection; Color; Feature extraction; Gaussian distribution; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Object recognition; Euclidean distance; Gaussian Mixture Model; Gmm (gaussian mixture model); Histogram of oriented gradients; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Moving object detection and tracking; Shadow detection and removals; Visual surveillance systems; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

The aim and objective of the study were given as follows (i) to perform an automated segmentation of hand from the radiograph using DTCWT based watershed algorithm; (ii) to compare the measured statistical features of the joint space of the hand using GLCM method, and (iii) to perform feed forward back propagation network for classification of subjects into RA and normal with high accuracy. The dual tree complex wavelet transform based watershed algorithm was found to be satisfactory in segmenting the hand automatically using the digitized radiograph. The feed forward BPN network was utilized for the classification of subjects into normal and RA patients from statistical features (total inputs, n = 45) extracted from hand X-ray image. The calculated accuracy of the classifier was found to be 95.7 %, whereas its sensitivity and specificity was found to be 88.2 and 98.1 % respectively.

However, FCN approaches do not necessarily incorporate local geometry such as smoothness and shape, whereas traditional image analysis techniques have benefitted greatly by them in solving segmentation and tracking problems. In this work, we address the problem of incorporating shape priors within the FCN segmentation framework.

We pursue the applicability of lifted inference for computer vision (CV), with the insight that a globally optimal (MAP) labeling will likely have the same label for two symmetric pixels. The success of our approach lies in efficiently handling a distinct unary potential on every node (pixel), typical of CV applications. This allows us to lift the large class of algorithms that model a CV problem via PGM inference. We propose a generic template for coarse-to-fine (C2F) inference in CV, which progressively refines an initial coarsely lifted PGM for varying quality-time trade-offs. We demonstrate the performance of C2F inference by developing lifted versions of two near state-of-the-art CV algorithms for stereo vision and interactive image segmentation.

Mitola in 1999 to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity for wireless communication. A Cognitive Radio Ad hoc Network (CRAHN) is one of the cognitive radio-based architectures in which wireless unlicensed nodes communicate in infrastructureless environment. Each node in CRAHN has the cognitive capability of sensing the surrounding radio environment for accessing the underutilized licensed spectrum in an opportunistic manner. But those unlicensed users (secondary users) should not make any interference to the communication of licensed users (primary users). In CRAHNs, each node operates as an end system and also as a router to forward packets for multi-hop communication. Due to the dynamic topology, time and space-varying spectrum availability and lack of centralized system, CRAHNs are vulnerable to various security attacks. Hello flood attack is a network layer attack in CRAHNs which can drain off the limited resources of CRAHN nodes by making excessive flooding of hello messages in the network.

Image Segmentation is a process of partitioning an image into homogenous non-overlapping regions of related content. The segmentation algorithms are based on two basic properties: discontinuity and similarity. An attempt is made here to develop an open source tool for image segmentation using python. The Python language is particularly beneficial in allowing the system to be expanded as there are a large number of Python libraries already available. It also provides good interoperability with other programming languages allowing existing code to be incorporated as part of the workflow. The tool is based on pull down menu driven graphical user interface. The tool provides basic file operations, filtering, segmentation, morphological operations and feature extraction routines. Laplacian edge detection, Gaussian smoothing, Canny, Gabor and Hough transform form a part of the filtering based segmentation. Erosion, Dilation, Opening and Closing are implemented under morphology. Segmentation menu includes Thresholding, Region Growing and Watershed segmentation techniques and work flow for road and building detection is implemented as feature extraction. The tool is particularly useful for feature extraction. One of the key advantages of the system proposed is that its modular nature allows other packages and routines to be incorporated alongside and to build new algorithms on top of the existing framework.

LTE-A system uses the Evolved Packet System Authentication and Key Agreement (EPS-AKA) protocol to mitigate the security issues and the cloning problem. However, there exist vulnerabilities like Redirection, Denial of Service and Man-in-the-Middle attacks which may lead the eavesdroppers to utilize and misuse the subscriber's resources. Therefore, in this paper an enhanced authentication and key agreement protocol namely DSAKA is developed to ensure the security and provide solutions to the vulnerabilities present in the exiting AKA authentication schemes. DS-AKA uses ElGamal Digital signature and Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to establish authentication in all stages between the User Equipment (UE) and Evolved NodeB (eNB). DS-AKA protocol is designed in such a way that it reduces the bandwidth utilization and the number of transactions for the authentication process, thereby it provides greater scalability. The proposed protocol is simulated using NS3 with LENA LTE module and the performances are compared with the existing AKA schemes. The proposed protocol was extensively analyzed and formal verifi cation was carried out using ProVerif and found that DS-AKA is more secured against various malicious attacks.","AKA; Diffie-hellman key exchange; ElGamal; EPS-AKA; LTE-A","Authentication; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Public key cryptography; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authentication and key agreement protocols; Authentication and key agreements; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; ElGamal; Elgamal digital signature; EPS-AKA; LTE-A; Man in the middle attacks; Long Term Evolution (LTE)","Prasad, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pondicherry Engineering CollegeIndia; email: prasad.psd@gmail.com",,"Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee",16079264,,,,"English","J.

Thus, CRN senses the available spectrum to find the most appropriate spectrum for allocation. Further, to maximize the efficient use of available spectrum, agreement (consensus) may be used wherein all users agree on a common decision value.

However, after extracting the secret data some of the image information gets lost. It is an important issue to have a data hiding scheme which can extract the secret data as well as can restore the original image without any loss of information. Such types of schemes are called reversible data hiding schemes which are commonly used in sensitive military, legal, and medical applications. The existing reversible data hiding schemes either provide good hiding capacity but inferior stego-image quality or good stego-image quality but poor hiding capacity because the stego-image quality and the hiding capacity are diametrically related parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel high capacity reversible data hiding scheme which has high data hiding capacity while maintaining good quality stego-image. In this scheme, we first cryptographically encode the secret data using a private key so that even if an attacker is able to extract the embedded secret data, he cannot get the original secret message unless he has the private key. Our scheme hides the secret data in two phases. In first phase, it uniformly divides the pixel intensity levels i.e., 0-255, into odd sized segments. Then the image is scanned in zigzag order to identify the concealable pixels, which have the same value as the middle elements of a segment. Some of the secret data is hidden into these identified pixels. In second phase, the intensity levels are again divided in reverse order, i.e., 255 to 0, into odd sized segments of uniform length like as in the first phase. The resultant image is again scanned in zigzag order and concealable pixels are identified. The remaining secret data is embedded into the concealable pixels. To ensure reversibility of our algorithm, a location map is maintained for each phase. The location maps are compressed using JBIG1 scheme and are transmitted through a secure channel along with other auxiliary information that contains private key and segment size. Experimentally our scheme achieves very high capacity without deteriorating the image quality. It is because we select the exact middle pixels of the segments to hide the secret data, which ensures that the pixel value does not get altered unevenly while embedding the secret data. It further helps in increasing the hiding capacity. Moreover, it is very simple as it does not require much computation for embedding the secret data. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Concealable pixel; Pixel mapping function; Reversible data hiding","Image quality; Image segmentation; Medical applications; Military applications; Pixels; Steganography; Auxiliary information; Data hiding capacity; Image information; Intensity levels; Pixel intensities; Pixel mapping; Reversible data hiding; Secure channels; Image processing","Kumar, R.; Division of Computer Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: rajivgarg@outlook.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948425343

On comparing the performance of resource allocation schedulers in the indistinguishable arrangement, we found the proportional fair (PF) offers balance in terms of individual metrics. Furthermore, we analyse the effect of feedback transmission time interval (TTI) delay on two typical EUTRAN networks referred to as long term evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advance (LTE-A).

Effective diagnosis and treatment of the wounds relies largely on a precise identification and measurement of the wounded tissue; however, in current clinical process, wound evaluation is based on subjective visual inspection and manual measurements which are often inaccurate. Given the cost and inconvenience of regular visits to wound clinics and for providing real time aid/care to remote and rural areas smart phone app named, Wound Vision which tracks/identifies the wound size, healing/management process based on images captured/processed within a smart phone is designed. Therefore this automated mobile-based system for fast and accurate segmentation and identification of wounds is desirable, both from the standpoint of improving health outcomes in chronic wound care, and in making clinical practice efficient and cost-effective for people in remote areas and cities. Satisfactory results of this real time mobile system suggest a promising tool to assist in the field of clinical wound evaluation. The simplicity of the algorithm/framework used suggests that it is a valuable tool in clinical wound evaluation. Future work will incorporate additional features (wound Tissue analysis-necrotic, fibrin & granulation tissue) for assessing the wound healing process in order to completely replace clinical praxis.

Text localization and recognition in an image is a research area which takes efforts to develop a computer system with an ability to automatically read the text from images. The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool gives good results obtained to read the text from an image. The objective of this study is to propose a new method for text localization and recognition in natural scene images with complex background. In this paper, a hybrid methodology is suggested which extracts text from natural scene image with chaotic backgrounds. The proposed approach involves four stages. First, superimposed text regions in an image are extracted based on character descriptors features like Area, Bounding box, Perimeter, Euler number, Horizontal crossings. In the second step, superimposed text regions are tested for text content or nontext using character descriptors and SVM classifier. In the third step, detection of multiple lines in localized text regions is done and line segmentation is performed using horizontal profiles. In the final step, using vertical profiles each character of the segmented line is extracted. The workout has been done using images drawn from ICDAR 2013 and SVT 2010 datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can be used as an efficient method for text localization and recognition in natural scene images. © 2017 IEEE.","Feature extraction; Natural scene images; Scene text; Segmentation; SVM Classifier; Text Localization; Text Recognition","Feature extraction; Optical character recognition; Natural scene images; Scene Text; SVM classifiers; Text localization; Text recognition; Image segmentation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

In this work, we address the problem of segmentation from medical images. Segmentation or object delineation from medical images/volumes is a fundamental step for subsequent quantification tasks key to diagnosis. Semantic segmentation has been popularly addressed using FCN (e.g. U-NET) with impressive results and has been the fore runner in recent segmentation challenges. However, there are a few drawbacks of FCN approaches which recent works have tried to address. Firstly, local geometry such as smoothness and shape are not reliably captured. Secondly, spatial context captured by FCNs while giving the advantage of a richer representation carries the intrinsic drawback of overfitting, and is quite sensitive to appearance and shape changes. To handle above issues, in this work, we propose a hybrid of generative modeling of image formation to jointly learn the triad of foreground (F), background (B) and shape (S). Such generative modeling of F, B, S would carry the advantages of FCN in capturing contexts. Further we expect the approach to be useful under limited training data, results easy to interpret, and enable easy transfer of learning across segmentation problems. We present ~8% improvement over state of art FCN approaches for US kidney segmentation and while achieving comparable results on CT lung nodule segmentation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image processing; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Semantics; Convolutional networks; Generative model; Kidney segmentation; Limited training data; Object delineation; Prediction problem; Semantic segmentation; Transfer of learning; Medical image processing","Ravishankar, H.; GE Global ResearchIndia; email: hariharan.ravishankar@ge.com","Zhu H.Niethammer M.Styner M.Zhu H.Shen D.Yap P.-T.Aylward S.Oguz I.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319590493,,,"English","Lect.

A node scheduling protocol for target coverage as an extension of energy efficient coverage preserving protocol (EECP), which determined the set covers based on the coverage probability and trust values is proposed.

However, typical robust-KPCA methods use heuristics for model fitting and perform outlier detection ignoring the variances of the data within principal subspaces. In this paper, we propose a novel method for robust statistical learning by extending the multivariate generalized-Gaussian distribution to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and employing it within a mixture model. We propose expectation maximization to fit our kernel generalized-Gaussian mixture model (KGGMM), using solely the Gram matrix and without the explicit lifting map. We exploit the KGGMM, including component means, principal directions, and variances, for abnormality detection in images. The results on 4 large publicly available datasets, involving retinopathy and cancer, show that our method outperforms the state of the art. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Abnormality detection; Expectation maximization; Generalized gaussian; Kernel methods; Mixture model; One-class classification; Robustness","Gaussian distribution; Heuristic methods; Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Robustness (control systems); Abnormality detection; Expectation - maximizations; Generalized Gaussian; Kernel methods; Mixture model; One-class Classification; Principal component analysis","Awate, S.P.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BombayIndia; email: suyash@cse.iitb.ac.in","Maier-Hein L.Franz A.Jannin P.Duchesne S.Descoteaux M.Collins D.L.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319661780,,,"English","Lect.

This is preposterous on account of conventional base stations (BS) for which site procurement is costly. Long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) defines the idea of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), where BSs with different coverage and capacity are utilized to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the clients. To maximize the transmission quality of the clients in the coverage holes, LTE-A also defines multihop relay (MHR) networks, where the relay stations (RSs) are also placed along with the BSs. Unfortunately, the placement approaches for HetNet and MHR serving nodes are not standardized. In this work, two different approaches like site selection with maximum service coverage (SSMSC) and site selection with minimum placement cost (SSMPC) are proposed, which identifies the required number of serving nodes, their types, and the placement locations to maximize the coverage and to maintain the placement cost (PC) within the limits of the total placement budget. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are computationally less complex and offer enhanced performance in terms of aggregate PC, coverage, and power proportion compared to the other conventional approaches. © 2017 Arthi Murugadass and Arulmozhivarman Pachiyappan.",,"Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Fuzzy logic; Heterogeneous networks; Quality of service; Site selection; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; Conventional approach; Heterogeneous network (HetNets); Multi-hop relay; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Relay stations; Spectral efficiencies; Transmission quality; Long Term Evolution (LTE)","Murugadass, A.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: arthimdas@gmail.com",,"Hindawi Limited",15308669,,,,"English","Wireless Commun.

Previous studies have shown that Arrhythmia can further lead to major cardiac diseases like the Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) syndrome. The difficulty in detecting Arrhythmia in the early stages often results in poor prognosis and presents the need for a costefficient diagnostic device. To this end, we propose a realtime portable ECG device with special emphasis on Arrhythmia detection and classification. The device is centered on a Raspberry Pi 3 (RasPi) module. RasPi with its signal processing and wireless transfer capabilities acts like an adapter between the sensors and a personalized mobile device application that is used for tracking the ECG. A highly sensitive peak detection algorithm was used by RasPi to detect and extract features from the ECG signals at real time. The peak detection algorithm was tested on the standard MITBIH arrhythmia database and reported an accuracy of greater than 95%.

Many papers were published which concerned with detection of vehicle during daytime. We propose a method which detects the vehicle during nighttime since it is problematic for human to analyze the shape of vehicles in nighttime due the limits of human vision. This project endeavors to implementation of vehicle detection based on vehicle taillight and headlight using technique of blobs detection by Center Surround Extremas (CenSurE). Blobs are the bright areas of the pixels of headlight and taillight. First stage is to extract blobs from region of interest by applying multiple Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator which derive the response by manipulating variance between surrounding of blob and luminance of blob which are grabbed on road scene images. Compared to the automatic thresholding technique, Laplacian of Gaussian operator provides more robustness and adaptability to work under different illuminated conditions. Then vehicle lights which are extracted from the first stage are clustered based on the connected—component analysis procedure, to confirm that it is vehicle or not. If vehicle is detected, then tracking of vehicle is done on the basis of the connected components using bounding box and different tracking parameters. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Advanced driving and assistance system; Computer vision; Image processing; Intelligent transport system; Vehicle detection","Advanced driver assistance systems; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Headlights; Image processing; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Laplace transforms; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Assistance system; Automatic thresholding; Connected component; Intelligent transport systems; Laplacian of Gaussian; Laplacian-of-gaussian operators; Region of interest; Vehicle detection; Vehicles","Wankhede, R.Y.; Embedded System Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering, SRM UniversityIndia; email: ram1103w@gmail.com","Das S.Panigrahi B.K.Dash S.S.Vijayakumar K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031731,,,"English","Adv.

In the next stage, a regional level process is integrated by calculating the Shannon energy and entropy to correctly examine the nonstationary pixels in the frames.

Blood vessel extraction is mainly used for diabetic retinopathy (DR) for automatic extraction and classification of severity of diseases. In our current work, blood vessel from fundus images is extracted using K-means segmentation. Afterwards, EPR is hidden using interpolation and trigonometric functions in fundus image. Finally, blood vessel is extracted from the watermarked image to measure the changes in accuracy of the proposed system. The percentage difference (< 0.25%) of accuracy in fundus images before watermarking and after watermarking claims the retention of devalorisation of vessel extraction accuracy measurement.

The main objective of this work is to build a computational diagnosis tool to identify the location of Stenosis even at the earlier stage by computing the CT Images acquired using CT Cardiac Angiography. The Computation begins by the process of 3D Reconstruction of coronary arteries from the acquired 2D Scan Data. The reconstructed 3D Model is subjected to the analysis of Computational Fluid Dynamic Characteristics such as Velocity and Wall Shear Stress (WSS) obtained by the simulation of blood flow in the reconstructed 3D model of an coronary artery. This method of diagnosing Stenosis through a non-invasive imaging modality called CT Cardiac Angiography followed by computer aided study will reduce the need for existing diagnosis method called Angiogram. Though an angiogram is a minimally invasive technique, it has serious complications on patients such as it may cause haemorrhage, stroke or even death while in critical condition whereas the CT Cardiac Angiography technique is found to be an added advantage for having a safe diagnosis to follow the medical status of a patient Post CABG surgery. © 2017 IEEE.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Coronary Arteries; CT Cardiac Angiography; Segmentation; Stenosis","Angiography; Biomineralization; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Heart; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Shear flow; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Cardiac angiography; Coronary arteries; Critical condition; Diagnosis methods; Method of diagnosing; Minimally-invasive technique; Non-invasive imaging; Stenosis; Blood vessels",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

The proposed biometric system uses two modalities, palm print and palm vein. The preprocessing steps begin with image acquisition of palm print and palm vein images using visible and infrared radiations, respectively. From the acquired image, region of interest (ROI) is extracted. The extracted information is encrypted using encryption algorithms. By this method of encryption, after ROI extraction, the storage of data consumes less memory and also provides faster access to the information. The encrypted data of both modalities are fused using advanced biohashing algorithm. At the verification stage, the image acquired is subjected to ROI extraction, encryption and biohashing procedures. The biohash code is matched with the information in database using matching algorithms, providing fast and accurate output.

In our work, we propose a new method to extract buildings using the wall facades. The motivation of using wall facades is based on the rise of terrestrial LiDAR compared to aerial LiDAR. The shape property is the most important information obtained from a LiDAR file. We try to use this shape property from the LiDAR file to segment buildings from the given scene. In the algorithm, the non-ground return points parallel to a facade of the potential building are combined to form multiple slices. These slices are parallel to the facade of a potential building. These slices are then merged based on the shape similarity and proximity to generate the footprint of the building. After generating the footprint of the building, we can also reconstruct the 3D model of the given building. The algorithm was tested both on simulated synthetic data containing different buildings and real world benchmark datasets. The results show complete segmentation of buildings from the synthetic datasets and promissory results from the real world datasets. The algorithm proposed is versatile in nature and can be easily adapted to different datasets with minimal modifications and tweaking. Existing works involve the use of secondary datasets like satellite images, orthophotos etc in order to aid in segmentation. Our work uses only the LiDAR data and no other secondary data to identify the buildings from the scene. Demonstration have been shown to segment partial buildings in a given scene as well. Thus, the novelty of the proposed work is non-dependence on any other form of data required except LiDAR. The applications of segmenting buildings from a given LiDAR scene can be used in urban planning, resource management and monitoring tasks. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

Adaptive threshold and multiple antennas are one of the solutions of such problems. In this paper, authors introduced a novel multiple antennas based centralized spectrum sensing (SS) technique for cognitive radio networks (CRNs). This paper is divided into two parts: part A uses multiple antennas based improved sensing detector (MA_ISD), and part B uses multiple antennas based centralized spectrum sensing (MA_CSS) technique. Now, in the part A: the presented scheme uses two detectors (TD) concept, first one is an energy detector with a single adaptive threshold (ED-SAT) and the second one is an energy detector with two adaptive thresholds (ED-TAT). Both detectors imply multiple antennas, following selection combination to select best signals. The proposed model enhances the detection performance and takes less sensing or detection time. The thresholds are adaptive as they are dependent on noise variance (σ2 ω), and the value of this noise variance changes according to the noise signal. Both the detectors work simultaneously and their output is then fed to a decision device which takes the decision using anOR rule. Results confirm that the presented multiple antennas based improved sensing detector (MA_ISD) technique improves the detection performance by 24.6%, 53.4%, 37.9%, and 49.6%, as compared to existing schemes (i.e. EDT-ASS-2015 scheme, ED and cyclo-2010, adaptive SS-2012, and conventional-ED) scheme at −12 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), respectively, while the number of antennas (Nr) = 2. Meanwhile, proposed technique also decreases sensing time in the order of 47.0 ms, 49.0 ms, and 53.2 ms as compared to existing schemes (EDT-ASS- 2015, Adaptive SS-2012, and ED and Cyclo-2010) scheme at −20 dB SNR respectively. Further, in the part B: cooperative SS (CSS) is introduced in which the local decisions from each cognitive radio are transferred to a fusion center (FC) that decides the final decision and shares the decision to every cognitive radio. It is also found that the proposed detection technique with CSS when a number of cognitive radio (CR) users (k) = 10, and Nr = 2, achieves detection performance as per IEEE 802.22 at very low SNR i.e. −20 dB. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017.","Centralized spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio networks; Single adaptive threshold; Two adaptive thresholds; Two detectors","Antennas; Fading (radio); Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Spurious signal noise; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptive thresholds; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio networks (CRNs); Detection performance; Multiple antenna; Spectrum sensing; Spectrum sensing techniques; Wireless communications; Cognitive radio","Kanti, J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Uttarakhand Technical UniversityIndia; email: jyotshanakanti@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",03029743,,,,"English","Lect.

After that, a preliminary segmentation of the images into primitive regions is generated by employing the region growing. Then, watershed is applied. There are some drawbacks in medical mage study, when watershed is employed after the region growing. The main drawbacks are: over segmentation, sensitivity to noise and incorrect identification of thin or low signal to noise ratio structures. The main issue of over segmentation is controlled by texture local binary pattern (LBP).

We have defined multiple intervals for multilevel thresholding using a novel meta-heuristic optimization technique called Discrete Curve Evolution. In each of these intervals, a threshold is selected by bi-level Otsu’s method. Then the ROI is extracted from only a single seed initialization, on the ROI, by the user. The proposed segmentation technique is more accurate as compared to the existing methods. Also the time complexity of our method is very low. The experimental evaluation is provided on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI slices of three patients, having the corresponding ground truth of the tumor regions. The performance measure, based on Jaccard and Dice indices, of the segmented ROI demonstrated higher accuracy than existing methods. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Delineation; Discrete curve evolution; GBM; MRI; Segmentation; Thresholding","Computer vision; Curve fitting; Image processing; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Tumors; Delineation; Discrete curve evolution; Experimental evaluation; Glioblastoma multiforme; Meta-heuristic optimization techniques; Multilevel thresholding; Segmentation techniques; Thresholding; Image segmentation","Banerjee, S.; Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 203 B.

Many times they end up at a erroneous result. To solve this, in the present work, a novel stereo image matching technique has been developed that identifies the most likely local minimum from the several possible local minima. The technique uses properties of the physical continuity of the land surface characteristic by the watershed segmentation applied to the disparity space volume. This helps to minimize the search for the local minima for matching. The matching is further improved by combining the watersheds of two stereo pairs from the tri-stereo. In the present study, experiments have been carried out using the standard Middlebury stereo datasets and remotely sensed tri-stereo images. Based on this approach the experiments are successfully carried out using the test dataset. The experimental results are compared with the results from the currently contemporary techniques of Dynamic Programming and Semi-Global Matching which resulted in 2-10 % improvement in density of matched points for different dataset. © 2017 ACRS.

It is one of the fields which is steadfastly growing in medical imaging, providing advances in ultrasound imaging technology. However, nerve identification continues to remain as one of the most challenging tasks that anesthetists can encounter in the UGRA technique of injection. One of the main reasons of this include the low quality of the ultrasound images which are affected by the introduction of unwanted speckle noise. Since, Regional anesthesia (RA) is one of most frequently undertaken tasks in hospitals throughout the world to reduce or nullify the effect of the persistent pain in patients, any discrepancy in providing anesthesia can lead to severe damage to the respective region of the body or side effects to the rest of the body and also to the life of the patient. This enhances the need for correctly identifying the right nerve region to provide anesthesia. In this paper, we survey the conventional methods [1] used in biomedical image processing.

This paper discusses detector response sensitivity with respect to temperature variation depending on selected technology. In back side illuminated (BSI) detectors, photons are directly impinged on the active epitaxial layer. Depth of absorption (DoA) vary depending on wavelength of radiation. Shorter wavelength (B1:450nm-520nm) is absorbed near the surface of exposure to EM radiation of epitaxial layer. Longer wavelength (B4:770nm-860nm) get absorbed deeper into the Epi layer towards the buried channel. DoA is a function of wavelength and temperature and it decreases with increase in die temperature. The generated free carriers (electrons) are pulled by the electric field under application of gate voltages. Carriers generated by shorter wavelength receives lower field strength. Hence, higher possibility of getting recombined before being pulled by the electric field. With increase in temperature the probability of getting pulled by the electric field decreases further. Hence, some of the carriers may get lost due to recombination. On the contrary, due to high depth of penetration, carriers generated by higher wavelength receives greater field strength and hence, greater probability of detection. Moreover, the field strength is also a function of carrier stored under a gate for a given bias. This is one reason which may lead to signal amplitude dependent spectral band specific sensitivity to temperature variation. Detection probability is usually defined as an electro-optical parameter known as quantum efficiency. So, in these devices, shorter wavelengths show a greater sensitivity to temperature variation compared to longer wavelength. © 2017 ACRS.

Various methods such as the histogram method, entropy based method, busyness measure methods, etc. are well known for threshold selection in the image segmentation problems. In this thesis, threshold selection is done on the basis of different entropy measures on both grayscale and color images. Comparative study of the Shannon and non-Shannon entropies (Renyi, Havrda-Charvat, Kapur and Vajda) with Otsu Method is done to obtain image segmentation. We classify these methods according to their evaluation criteria viz. PRI (Probabilistic Rand Index), VOI (Variation of Information) and GCE (Global Consistency Error). These underlying metrics and combination methods help in determining the performance of an evaluation measure. It is observed through the simulation experiments performed on images, that the position of the smallest minima obtained in the entropy versus gray-level plot is different for each entropy measure. For a particular definition of the entropy plots are generated and the threshold values obtained from these plots possess the segmentation results.

The IIF test identifies the presence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) in patient serum. However, the proper detection of HEp-2 cells from the IIF images is an important prerequisite for the recognition of staining patterns of ANAs. The characteristics of HEp-2 cell images, due to fluorescence intensity, make the segmentation process more challenging. Recently, rough-fuzzy clustering algorithms have been shown to provide significant results for image segmentation by handling different uncertainties present in the images. But, the neighbourhood information is completely ignored in these algorithms. However, the spatial information is useful when the image is distorted by different imaging artefacts. In this regard, the paper presents a segmentation algorithm by incorporating the neighbourhood information into rough-fuzzy clustering algorithm. In the current study, the class label of a pixel is influenced by its neighbouring pixels, depending on their local spatial constraint and local grey level constraint.

This paper deals with the former one (i.e. channel bandwidth); the real time images from any source occupy large amount space in any storage device. Hence it consumes maximum bandwidth for transmitting it, there are so many methods to reduce the image size and hence the bandwidth of the signal. This paper deals with wavelet based compression methods. Discrete Wavelet Transform is powerful tool for analyzing the signals, with the help of a thresholding function it'll be more useful in compression; this method is considered as an existing method. This method has some disadvantages like selectivity and shift invariance, so a much better method is proposed.

Geometry-based point classification (line-, surface-, point-type features) is determined using shape of the local neighborhood, given by the local geometric descriptor (LGD) at every point in the point cloud. Covariance matrix of local neighborhoods is the conventionally used LGD in the LiDAR community. However, it is known that covariance analysis has drawbacks in detection of sharp features, which are a subset of the line-type features. Here, we compare the performance of new variants of existing LGDs, such as weighted covariance matrix, and that based on tensor voting concept, in geometric classification with that of covariance matrix. We propose a multi-scale probabilistic saliency map based on eigenvalues of the LGDs for computing the classification. Usually the state-of-the-art performance analyses of LGDs in the classification outcomes are done downstream after feature extraction. We propose that the comparisons may be done upstream at the classification stage itself, which can be achieved by expressing these LGDs as positive semidefinite second-order tensors. We perform qualitative comparisons of the tensor fields based on shape and orientation of the tensors, and the classification outcomes using visualizations. We visualize LGDs using superquadric tensor glyphs and point rendering, using our proposed saliency map as colormap. Our detailed comparative analysis shows that the new variant of LGDs based on tensor voting classify line-type features, especially sharp features, better than covariance-based LGDs. Our proposed LGD based on tensor voting performs better than the covariance matrix, for our goal of detecting sharp features, e.g. gabled roofs in buildings. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Covariance matrix; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Extraction; Feature extraction; Geometry; Image segmentation; Matrix algebra; Optical radar; Tensors; Comparative analysis; Geometric classification; Geometric descriptor; Point sampled geometry; Positive semidefinite; Second-order tensors; State-of-the-art performance; Weighted covariance; Classification (of information)","Sreevalsan-Nair, J.; Graphics-Visualization-Computing Lab, International Institute of Information Technology BangaloreIndia; email: jnair@iiitb.ac.in",,"Springer Heidelberg",16123786,,,,"English","Math.

In each subband, the reflectance and noise of the logarithmically transformed wavelet coefficients are modeled using heavy-tailed Burr and zero-mean Gaussian distributions. The closed-form expression for the shape parameter of Burr distribution is derived by employing the Mellin transform.

The features from each of the face images are extracted by making use of Local Binary Patterns (LBP). The feature values will further be used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In the testing phase, the same process is carried out and SVM makes the prediction based on the training data-set to which class the face belongs to. The effectiveness of the proposed system’s prediction is demonstrated by collecting different video data-set and the accuracy of the model is comparable. The proposed system aims to classify two persons and accuracy of the model is calculated using K-fold cross validation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Key frame extraction; Local binary patterns (LBP); Support vector machine (SVM)","Artificial intelligence; Bins; Face recognition; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Face classification; Face identification; Feature values; K fold cross validations; Key-frame extraction; Local binary patterns; Prediction-based; Training data sets; Computer vision","Athani, S.; B.V.

They have highly improved in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions and by the sheer volume of collected images, the necessity of simplification of automation in feature extraction. Road data play a key role in urban planning, traffic management, military applications, and vehicle navigation as well as for decision making in numerous applications. The faster updation of road infrastructure is a need because the technology has brought map in the hands of people in the form of mobile phones and tablets. Road detection is one of the major issues of the road infrastructure extraction. Its accuracy depends on the type of methodology used. An attempt is made here to analyse the first order, the co-occurrence texture features and image transforms useful for discriminating roads from other features specially the buildings. The identified dataset forms high dimension feature space and the Support Vector Machine is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of high dimensional datasets. In the past, SVMs have been tested and evaluated only as pixel-based image classifiers. Moving from pixel-based techniques towards object-based representation, the dimensions of remote sensing imagery feature space increases significantly. An SVM approach for classification was followed, based on primitive image objects produces by a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The SVM procedure produced the final object classification results which were compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier results and were found to give better results in OBIA domain. © 2017 ACRS.

But such images are prone to noise due to the effects of eyelashes, poor light etc. and must be treated before subsequent steps of iris recognition are applied.

The future 5G cellular networks also envisage massive deployment ofMTC Devices (MTCDs) which will increase the total number of connected devices hundredfold. This poses a huge challenge to the traditional cellular system processes, especially the traditional Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism currently used in LTE systems, as the signaling load caused by the increasingly large number of devices may have an adverse effect on the regular Human to Human (H2H) traffic. A solution in the literature has been the use of group based architecture which, while addressing the authentication traffic, has their share of issues.This paper introduces Hierarchical Group based Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement (HGMAKA) protocol to address those issues and also enables the small cell heterogeneous architecture in line with 5G networks to support MTC services.The aggregateMessage Authentication Code based approach has been shown to be lightweight and significantly efficient in terms of resource usage compared to the existing protocols, while being robust to authentication message failures, and scalable to heterogeneous network architectures. © 2017 Probidita Roychoudhury et al.",,"5G mobile communication systems; Authentication; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Queueing networks; Authentication codes; Heterogeneous architectures; Heterogeneous devices; Hierarchical groups; Machine type communications; Machinetype communication (MTC); Mutual authentication; Wireless data communication; Wireless telecommunication systems","Roychoudhury, P.; National Institute of Technology MeghalayaIndia; email: probidita.phukan@gmail.com",,"Hindawi Limited",19390114,,,,"English","Secur.

Generally, microstrip lines are used in high frequency RF printed circuit boards for propagating high speed signals in wireless communication. Since RF front end modules in wireless system supports a wide ultra wide band frequency range from 700 MHz to 12 GHz, package density parasitic effects have been a major issue which degrades system performance. The close proximity of signal transmission lines with a high packing density results signal integrity problems such as crosstalk and timing jitter. A modified coupled microstrip line is proposed to reduce crosstalk by means of increasing capacitive coupling ratio. Our proposed structure reduced far end crosstalk by 4 dB and near end crosstalk by 4 dB than existing structures.

However sudden high peaks in OFDM signal envelope lead to high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Enhanced values of PAPR result into complex RF amplifier circuit with reduced efficiency. There are various methods available for PAPR reduction, out of them partial transmit sequence (PTS) is most effective proven choice for PAPR reduction. However PTS technique requires cumbersome searching of all possible phase factors to find optimal phase factor which produces lowest PAPR, the information regarding optimal phase set used at the transmitter need to be sent to the receiver as side information (SI) for decoding purpose, however transmitting SI requires additional transmission bandwidth thus reducing overall bandwidth efficiency. To reduce the exhaustive searching genetic algorithm (GA) could be used with PTS leading to GA-PTS system. In this paper a GA-PTS system is proposed which uses novel octagonal geometry for constellation extension purpose. This scheme does not require transmission of any side information for decoding purpose at receiver and at the same time GA-PTS system reduces the required number of searches. Simulations are presented to show that proposed scheme provides similar PAPR performance as conventional PTS but without need of SI transmission at reduced number of searches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","C-PTS; GA-PTS; OFDM; PAPR; Side information","Bandwidth; Decoding; Efficiency; Frequency division multiplexing; Genetic algorithms; Radio frequency amplifiers; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bandwidth efficiency; Constellation extensions; High speed transmission; PAPR; Partial transmit sequence; Peak to average power ratio; Side information; Transmission bandwidth; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Joshi, A.; Department of ECE, Jaypee Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: 20.alok@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982171768

In last decade many researchers have shown interest in developing the models for BER, while in the paper we have made an analysis and comparison of the model developed for the optimizing the error in the speech signal.

Image thresholding being a simple and effective technique, mostly used for image segmentation and these thresholds are optimized by optimization techniques by maximizing the Tsallis entropy. However, as the two level thresholding is extended to multi-level thresholding, the computational complexity of the algorithm is further increased. So there is need of evolutionary and swarm optimization techniques. In this paper, first time optimal thresholds are obtained by maximizing the Tsallis entropy using novel adaptive cuckoo search algorithm (ACS). The proposed ACS algorithm performance of image segmentation is tested using natural and standard images.

The main aim of the proposed work is to represent and recognize face images with different poses. An efficient face recognition system with face image representation using wavelet and averaged wavelet packet coefficients in the form of Discriminative Common Vector (DCV) and modified Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and recognition using radial basis function (RBF) neural network is presented. Face images are decomposed by 2-level two-dimensional (2-D) wavelet and wavelet packet transformation. The discriminative common vectors are obtained for wavelet and averaged wavelet packet coefficients. Newly proposed LBP operator is applied on the DCV and LBPs are obtained. Histogram values are generated for the LBP and recognized using RBF network. The proposed work is tested on three standard face databases namely Olivetti-Oracle Research Lab (ORL), Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) and Essex face database. The extracted features are recognized by the proposed method results in good recognition rates.

Whales continued to be endangered animals though they don't have direct predators. To ensure the survival of this endangered species, marine biologists are tracking them to know their status and health of the species at all times. Manual recognition of whale is most tricky and hence automated system helps biologist to develop conservation strategies for different species of whale. This can be primarily achieved through individual whale recognition and tracking their behavior by analyzing the data collected. In this paper we have proposed a method for finding the matching pairs of whales by analyzing the caudal fin images of whales in the data set. For finding the matching pairs we have segmented the caudal fins from the background images using GrabCut and FloodFill algorithm. From the segmented images key features are extracted using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and key features are matched using the FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) matcher. Finally the matched pairs are ranked using the confidence values.","FloodFill; GrabCut; Matching; Recognition; Segmentation; SIFT features; Whale","Automation; Ecosystems; Fins (heat exchange); Floods; Image segmentation; Nearest neighbor search; FloodFill; GrabCut; Matching; Recognition; SIFT Feature; Whale; Conservation",,"Mandl T.Ferro N.Goeuriot L.Cappellato L.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034778273

Confronts related to such a debate seem more predominant in presence of the malicious secondary users when the transmission range of licensed users is shorter compared to the network size. In this paper, a model is introduced which verifies the distance both geographically and through the measuring distance obtained by received power of cognitive user. This is achieved by minimizing the interference to the primary licensed user and upon the faithful operation of the secondary user by calculating the trustworthiness of all users irrespective of their priority. This necessitates focus upon the free space propagation path loss of the transmitted signal. Thus, analysis of the trustworthiness becomes essential followed by calculation of link budget power that ensures the designing cost without extra overhead during a secured communication with the received power and free space propagation path loss. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cognitive radio network (CRN); Link budget; Path loss; Trustworthiness; WLAN","Ad hoc networks; Budget control; Computation theory; Intelligent computing; Network security; Radio systems; Secure communication; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Link budgets; Path loss; Trustworthiness; WLAN; Cognitive radio","Rout, A.; Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, IGIT SarangIndia; email: ashimarout@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

Captive data has limited utility. Data communication among devices, for shared usage and further processing, revolutionized the world through Information and Communication Technologies. Data communication systems piggy backed on the telecommunication network and went on with it from wireless to wireline domain. GPRS/EDGE, EVDO/WCDMA, mobile WiMAX/LTE are the three generations of mobile wireless access technology domains in the local area. The backhaul transport system consists of optical fibre links and nodes with route switching systems called Routers. Routers also acts as add/drop nodes where data processing devices, called servers, are connected which serves application services data to user community. Pure wireless data communication networks has also been evolved as wi-fi network which covers very small area but provide very large bandwidth and functions in ISM band. Wi-Fi networks are considered equivalent to fourth Generation access network. The generation of technologies has been designed based on commitments of data throughputs and environmental conditions. The present paper analyses the throughputs available in practical conditions for GPRS, EDGE, EVDO, WCDMA and WiMAX.

SD is the technique of highlighting the information of the images which are relevant to human vision. It finds usage in medical imaging, telemetry, advertisement etc. Often SD is performed at a place far away from where the image is captured. So CS can be used to compressively sample the image and thus reduce the amount of image data to be transmitted. But CS reconstruction brings about degradation in the image quality. In this work, CS is combined with SD and the effect of CS on the final saliency map is obtained and compared with the ground truth obtained by using SD without CS. The effect is studied in terms of accuracy, precision and recall of the final saliency maps. This paper proves that though CS tries to degrade the saliency maps, the savings in transmission energy, data rate far outweighs the degradation. Moreover, the degradation effect can be minimized by choosing the sampling rate carefully. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Absorbing Markov chain; Compressive sensing; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Saliency detection; Saliency map","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive radio; Image compression; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Markov processes; Medical imaging; Wireless networks; Absorbing Markov chain; Compressive sensing; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Saliency detection; Saliency map; Compressed sensing","Ghosh, S.; E&TCE Department, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, ShibpurIndia; email: susmita.0391@gmail.com","Mandal J.K.Mukhopadhyay S.Dutta P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811064265,,,"English","Commun.

To overcome the problems such as to estimate accurate disparities near object boundaries, in repetitive texture regions or textureless regions and in occluded areas, we estimate disparity map by minimizing the global energy functional consists of data and regularizer terms, using variational model with coarse-to-fine pyramidal approach.The pyramidal approach is used to handle large disparities. To optimize the regularizer in the energy fuctional, we use spatially varying regularization parameter instead of a fixed value for the entire image which is common to any variational framework but unsuitable for remotely sensed stereo images because of various image characteristices such as texture. In this approach, we use the pixel wise image gradient and the estimated intermediate disparity gradient to initialize and update the regularization parameter at each pixel location. The initialization consists of K-means clustering in the image gradient space and assignment of a per-class value of regularization. This has impact on the required regularization factor for a group of pixels. Step wise updation is involved at all levels in the pyramid by calculating the disparity in scale space followed by computing the derivative of the disparity map.The proposed method is found to be effective in dealing with the limitation of fixed regularization of the core variational method for increasing the accuracy while estimating the dense disparity map. We evaluate the estimated disparity map quantitatively using bad pixel error with various threshold values comparing with the ground truth. Bad pixel error is calculated considering all the pixels of the input image as well as only nonoccluded pixels. © 2017 ACRS.

It has the significant impact on the computer guided medical image diagnosis and research. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain data are severely affected by the noise and inhomogeneity artifacts which lead to blurry edges in the intersection of the intra-organ soft tissue regions. This paper presents a novel two stage framework for segmenting the 3D brain MR image data. The first stage consists of modified fuzzy c-means algorithm (MoFCM) which incorporates the spatial neighborhood information of the volume data to define the new local membership function along with the traditional fuzzy c-means (FCM) membership function. The cluster prototypes obtained from the first stage are fed into the modified spatial fuzzy c-means (MSFCM) algorithm which includes 3D spatial information of the 3D brain MR image volume to generate the final prototypes. Our main endeavor is to address the shortcomings of the traditional FCM which is highly sensitive to noise as it solely depends on the intensity values of the image and develop a new method which performs well in noisy environment. The method is validated on several simulated and in-vivo 3D brain MR image volumes.

In this paper, a hybrid approach for accurate segmentation of the ultrasound medical images is presented that utilizes both the features of kernel fuzzy clustering with spatial constraints and edge based active contour method using distance regularized level set (DRLS) function. The result obtained from the kernel fuzzy clustering is utilized not only to initialize the curve that spreads to identify the estimated region or object boundaries, but also helps to estimate the optimal parameters, which are responsible for controlling the level set evolution. The DRLS formulation also increase the processing speed by removing the need of re-initialization of the level set function. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting the several experiments on both the synthetic and real ultrasound images. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the segmentation accuracy and also produces better results by successfully segmenting the object boundaries compared to others. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distance regularized level set; Edge based active contour; Kernel fuzzy C-means; Segmentation; Ultrasound","Diagnosis; Fuzzy clustering; Image segmentation; Numerical methods; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Active contour method; Active contours; Distance regularized level sets; Fuzzy C mean; Level set functions; Segmentation accuracy; Spatial constraints; Ultrasound medical images; Medical imaging; accuracy; Article; diagnostic imaging; hybrid; kernel method; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; priority journal; ultrasound","Gupta, D.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, VNITIndia; email: er.deepgupta@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",17468094,,,,"English","Biomed.

MIMO technique is defined as the technique containing multiple transmitter antennas and multiple receiver antennas. MIMO systems can provide a potentially very high capacity that, in many cases, grows approximately linear with the number of antennas. This technique increases the data rate, while OFDM saves the bandwidth and reduces fading. In this scheme, the entire signal orthogonally overlaps in a frequency domain that saves the bandwidth. IDMA scheme is based on interleaving technique. It distinguishes the users by chip level interleaving principle. IDMA scheme is better than any other available multiple access schemes available for underwater communication.

This paper presents novel local edge profile detection and preservation based denoising algorithm for digital images in presence of zero mean Gaussian noise. Detecting and preserving sharp changes in image pixel intensities preserves the visual quality of the denoised image. Twenty four different types and orientations of edges are detected in 3×3 overlapping tiles of a picture. Based on the edge type and orientation, each tile is subjected to integration along the direction of the detected edge. This preserves the edges. Simple averaging is done if a tile does not have any edge. Continuity of edges is maintained by taking the overlapping tiles of the same edge and integrating both the neighbouring tiles in the direction of the edge. The integration across the edges are avoided to preserve the sharpness of the edges. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with other denoising algorithms in terms of a novel edge representation parameter i.e. number of edge tiles in the input image. The proposed algorithm clearly outperforms the other contemporary algorithms. Most of the other algorithms either over construct or under construct the edges during denoising. © 2017 IEEE.","Conditional filtering; Denoising; Edge preservation; Local Edge detection; Local Profile","Gaussian noise (electronic); Image denoising; Image processing; Image segmentation; Contemporary algorithms; De-noising; De-noising algorithm; Edge preservations; Image pixel intensities; Local edge detections; Local Profile; Visual qualities; Edge detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055593,,,"English","Proc.

A good network planning will be the one, which results in less infrastructural expenses by utilizing optimal resources while ensuring more customers' satisfaction. The increase in number of mobile tower sites Base Transreceiver Station (BTS) with growing customers, not only raises the total cost of the cellular network but it also has a great impact on radiation hazards issues. It is vital to optimally select BTS sites in the design of cellular networks. Selecting BTS sites in a varying topographic area with non-uniform users' distribution, such as Uttarakhand, is another major challenge. With path loss estimation along with propagation prediction models coupled with careful analysis of spatial data and obtaining topographical information from Geographic Information Systems (GIS), potential tower locations can be determined. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the site suitability of Base Stations of BSNL cellular radio networks in Uttarakhand with the objective of optimizing and automating the process of network planning. Geographic information, such as satellite images, topographical maps, municipal digital maps, Aster DEM, site parameters of existing BSNL towers (such as Latitude and Longitude, antenna height, frequencies) of study area are collected from different sources. Using these data various layers of road network, rivers, habitat and forest cover have been formed in ArcGIS software to locate the suitable sites. Dead zones and overlapping area of existing tower coverage has been spotted out. Hence, analysis of existing towers of the study area has been done for finding the optimal positions of tower placement. © 2017.

However supporting the quality of service (QoS) of real-time multimedia applications is still an important research issue as there is need for the cross-layer optimization strategies involving application, routing, MAC and physical layers. Towards this, we analytically derive our routing metric by using 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) basis access mechanism. Using this model, we design a novel cross-layer routing metric called Interference and Contention Aware (ICA) metric by considering delay, channel utilization, inter-flow interference and intra-flow interference to find the optimal path. We extend the work by adapting the traffic rate at the application layer of a source node by using the statistics provided by the routing metric. We implement this joint approach using Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) in NS2. The results reveal that ICA routing metric performs better in terms of throughput and delay compared to Metric for Channel Diversity (MIND), Contention-Aware Transmission Time (CATT) and Interference Aware Routing (iAWARE). Further, cross-layer approach of routing and rate adaptation helps the applications to adapt the transmission rate based on the congestion at the network layer. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.","Cross layer design; Multi-radio; Rate adaptation; Routing metric; Wireless mesh networks","Cost effectiveness; Mesh generation; Network layers; Network routing; Quality of service; Routers; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Wireless telecommunication systems; 802.11 distributed coordination functions; Cross-layer design; Multi-radio; Multi-radio wireless mesh networks; Optimized Link State Routing; Rate adaptation; Real time multimedia applications; Routing metrics; MESH networking","Narayan, D.G.; Dept. of Information Science and Engineering, B.V.B College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: narayan-dg@bvb.edu",,"IOS Press",09266801,,JHSNE,,"English","J High Speed Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017507387

The above task has been accomplished through a feature extraction technique, based on bitwise XOR operation between consecutive gray scale frames of the video. Thresholding mechanism is employed to segment the videos into shots. Dissimilarity matrix is constructed to select a representative keyframe from every shot of a video sequence.

Mostly, MANETs are used in group communication mechanisms like military applications, rescue operations, emergency search, vehicular ad-hoc communications and mining operations etc. In such type of networks, a group communication takes place by the multicasting technique. Communication and collaboration is necessary among the nodes in the groups in multicast protocols. The PUMA has the best multicast routing protocol as compared to the tree and mesh based multicast protocols, although it suffers from the security issues. Mainly, PUMA suffers from the Man in the middle attack (MITM) which generates traffic flow; drop the packets and miscommunicate the neighbor nodes with the false hop count. So, defending from the MITM attack, we designed a new mechanism called Elliptic Curve Group Diffie-Hellman (ECGDH). This approach compares the results of PUMA routing protocol with the legitimate, under attack and after providing security against an attack. Finally, we observed that ECGDH gives efficient results even after the attack has happened. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Military applications; Mobile security; Multicasting; Network routing; Network security; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad-hoc communication; Communication and collaborations; Group communications; Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack; Mesh-based multicast protocols; Multicast protocol; Multicast routing protocol; Wireless communications; Routing protocols",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

The existence of a huge number of symbols and varying characteristics in these languages makes segmentation and extraction of text a challenging task. The Tamil language has a wide variety of the literature, and printed text is available in various forms such as newspaper, books, and magazines. In this paper, extraction of printed Tamil text from an image is done irrespective of the characteristics of the text such as font style, color, and size. The proposed work uses scanned printed Tamil text as the input image. This input image is binarized since text is always available in the foreground, and histograms can be used to segment them into lines and words. The morphological operator, dilation, is used to remove outliers such as dots and commas present in an underlying object and segment the printed text into words to facilitate text detection. Further, each character is identified using bounding box technique. Classification of Tamil letters is done by extracting features such as gradient information and curvature-based information obtained from grayscale and binary images. These features are trained, and characters are classified using Bayesian classifier. The recognized characters are documented as text using Unicode format.

We have sophisticated algorithms to analyze the traffic videos in real time and discover information of interest. Although some sensors could be more accurate, they could also be Intrusive and need a higher maintenance cost. We may need to embed weighing sensors in road to measure vehicle feature and classify vehicle size. In video surveillance systems, it is very complicated to extract more number of features from a video. It has been also inferred that more computations are required to calculate background model and to extract the key frames. In this paper, a novel algorithm is implemented which counts and classifies highway vehicles using regression. The algorithm proposed in this paper, starts with preprocessing the Low Quality videos by Removal of Noise using Bi-lateral filtering, followed by color image based Background mask generation using Multi-layer Background subtraction technique. A fast performing kernel is designed which then used to extract the Foreground mask using Mixture of Gaussians. Finally Contour extraction and Cascaded Regression will results the foreground moving objects in the Low quality video. © 2017 IEEE.","Color image based background model; Low quality video; Regression analysis; Vehicle counting; Vehicle detection","Highway engineering; Image segmentation; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Vehicles; Video cameras; Background model; Background subtraction techniques; Low qualities; Mixture of Gaussians; Traffic information; Vehicle counting; Vehicle detection; Video surveillance systems; Security systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

In the first layer, a different encryption technique is used through which the secret message in English language is translated into the combinations of different human languages based on the sender’s secret key. Using self constructed alphabet matrices the plain text is converted into Unicode format for three Indian languages Tamil, Hindi and Kannadam. A new key generation algorithm is designed to select the language combination. In the second layer, the translated secret data is further encrypted by the method of diagonal indexing. In the third layer, the resulting text is embedded into a cover text, from which a key is created using the position of the matched letters. In the fourth layer,after that the cover text is embedded in an image using last pixel bit embedding method and that image is passed to the receiver along with the key embedded in a separate image.

Clustering based image segmentation algorithms group the color and texture features of the image into different clusters. The performance of the clustering algorithms depends on the cardinality and choice of initial cluster centroids, and end up in a different solution each time the clustering algorithm is executed. Finding the best solution from these set of solutions needs an efficient optimization algorithm. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm which combines the merits of two popular evolutionary algorithms, Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are combined for solving color image segmentation problem. The texture feature of the image, obtained by using Weber Power Local Binary Pattern (WPLBP), is binary and the color feature obtained by homogeneity model is real variable. GA is more suitable for binary variable optimization problems and TLBO is suitable for optimizing real variables. Further TLBO is computationally efficient and does not need parameter tuning.","Clustering; Fuzzy Sets; Genetic Algorithm; Hybrid Algorithms; Rough Sets; Segmentation; Soft Sets; Teaching Learning Based Optimization","Bins; Color; Color image processing; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy sets; Genetic algorithms; Image segmentation; Image texture; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Real variables; Rough set theory; Clustering; Color and texture features; Colour image segmentation; Computationally efficient; Hybrid algorithms; Image segmentation algorithm; Soft sets; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Clustering algorithms",,"Castillo O.Douglas C.Ao S.I.Feng D.D.Korsunsky A.M.","Newswood Limited",20780958,9789881404732,,,"English","Lect.

By combining elements in a phased array beamforming is achieved. This is done in such a way that, signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. To detect and calculate the signal-of-interest at the output of a sensor array by means of the most desirable spatial filtering and interference rejection, adaptive beamforming is used. But, before beamforming technique, the directions of desired users and undesired users or interferes must be prevailed using a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm.

Further as the resolution of data increases the intra-object homogeneity decreases. In the proposed approach we use localised processing and leverage object-level attributes for classification. Localised adaptive segmentation is proposed for segmenting probable aircraft objects from the image and then object classification is performed using kNN and SVM.

For non real-time, it does not care for the Quality of Service (QoS) performance. But for real-time services, the CAC cares for the QoS by keeping the sufficient bandwidth throughout the transmission. Bandwidth determines the system capacity and speed. In this paper, a new Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based CAC algorithm is proposed for increasing the number of admission and reducing the admission of less compressed calls. For this task the various codecs such as G.711, G.729, G.723, G.726, AMR, EVRC, and iLBC have been taken. AHP is applied among them to take the right decision and it produces the ranking order. That rank helps to save more bandwidth and increases the throughput (Packets per second). This task is carried out by taking the criteria like bandwidth, packetization delay, and compression ratio of each individual codecs.

It is a non-invasive procedure to evaluate the presence of eye diseases and monitor the response to treatments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a system designed using infrared thermal image processing that detects glaucoma. Euclidean distance based segmentation technique is used to threshold the IR image to obtain the region of interest, where the manifestation of glaucoma is predominant. Features are extracted using statistical moments from the temperature mapped IR image and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix of the IR image. Two significant attributes, namely the homogeneity and area of region of interest are the inputs to a Support Vector Machine classifier to classify a given input ocular thermal image as a normal or diseased image. In our simulation study, one hundred ocular thermal images with even number of normal and diseased subjects were analysed. The classifier has achieved a maximum accuracy of 96% when homogeneity and area of region of interest are used as attributes, indicating the potential use of proposed method for screening patients even at early stages of glaucoma.","Glaucoma; Gray level co-occurrence matrices; Support vector machine; Temperature mapping; Thermal imaging","Diagnosis; Image classification; Image processing; Infrared imaging; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ophthalmology; Support vector machines; Thermography (imaging); Glaucoma; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Infrared thermal image; Segmentation techniques; Simulation studies; Statistical moments; Support vector machine classifiers; Temperature mapping; Image segmentation",,,"University of Zagreb",13301136,,,,"English","J.

This paper aims to develop a computer assisted system for quantification of erythrocytes in microscopic images of thin blood smears. The proposed method consists of preprocessing, segmentation, morphological filtering, cell separation and clump cell segmentation. The major issues, required to be addressed to enhance the performance of the system are cell separation (i.e. isolated and clump erythrocytes classification) and clump cell segmentation. The geometric features such as cell area, compactness ratio and aspect ratio have been used to define the feature set. Further, the performance of the system in classifying the isolated and clump erythrocytes is evaluated for the different classifiers such as Naive Bayes, k-NN and SVM. Moreover, the clump erythrocytes are segmented using marker controlled watershed with h-minima as internal marker.

Text detection and text segmentation in video data and images is a difficult task due to low contrast and noise from background. Our methodology focuses not only on spatial information of pixel but also optical flow of image data for detecting moving and static text. This paper provides an iterative algorithm with super resolution to reduce information into its fundamental unit, like alphabets and digits in our case. Proposed method performs image enhancement and sub pixel mapping Jiang Hao and Gao (Applied Mechanics and Materials. 262, 2013) [1] to localize text region and Stroke width Transformation Algorithm (SWT) Epshtein et al. (CVPR, 2010) [2] is used for further noise removal. Since SWT may include some non-text region, so SVM using HOM Khare et al. (A new Histogram Oriented Moments descriptor for multi-oriented moving text detection in video, 42(21):7627-7640, 2015) [3] as a descriptor is also used in Final text Selection, Components that satisfy is called a text region. Due to low resolution of images there is a text cluster to remove this text cluster, it is super resolved using sub pixel mapping and hence again passed through process for further segmentation giving an overall accuracy to around 80%.

Searching these voluminous image databases over web requires either visual features or text available in form of captions or tags. Another issue with visual search is the ambiguity in tagging where same content is expressed in different words by different users. Therefore textual search, which is easier for representing information and reliable to access it, is generally used to explore huge database of images. Another issue with visual search is the ambiguity in tagging i.e. tagging of the same content using different words by different users. To address these issues, we propose a simple and effective image annotation model based on probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA). In our framework, the probabilistic model serves two fold purpose: firstly to label various textual words against the images while the second being the identification of the visual features for tagging. In this paper, we resolve multi-tag problem against each image. This approach has been rigorously tested on LabelMe dataset and the results are found to be encouraging. This facilitates the multiple relevant tags to given input image. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Expectation Maximization; Image annotation; Probabilistic latent component","Artificial intelligence; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Pattern recognition; Expectation - maximizations; Image annotation; Image collections; Image database; Model-based OPC; Probabilistic latent component; Probabilistic latent component analysis; Probabilistic modeling; User interfaces","Tripathi, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: eez128368@ee.iitd.ac.in","Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319698991,,,"English","Lect.

Spectral Clustering techniques are developed by using concepts of graph, algebra theories and conventional clustering methods. The theories and experiments conducted in various areas like, pattern recognition and image segmentation prove that it is having global reputation. This paper is to provide a framework for spectral clustering in different phases and its advantages when compared with traditional data clustering algorithms. In lieu of this paper, it is upgraded by intervening the inputs such as to making the bounds of clustering i.e., providing the issues through its relevance factors-produced by spectral clustering. On the other hand, some fundamental issues related to improving the quality of the output clusters are also covered. Constructing a sound similarity matrix is the most direct and efficient way to improve the quality of clusters. For building the similarity matrix sometimes we may choose the distance measures for measuring the similarity. This paper provides the issues related to improving the quality of the clusters produced by spectral clustering. We implemented spectral clustering in WEKA tool and produced the results for different similarity measures and observed how the quality of the clusters improved.

This can be achieved with the regular screening of patients known to have Diabetes for 5 years or more. Once detected with DR, it is important for doctors to maintain the progress of the disease down the line. This includes identification and marking of DR features in the fundus images. Manual marking of DR features like exudates and hemorrhages is tedious and error prone job for opthalmologists. Detection of DR is widely done with fundus imaging technique. To help aid ophthalmologists, the DR features in fundus images can be automatically marked using machine learning algorithms [1]. In this paper, a novel and generalized method for segmenting the fundus images is proposed. With our approach, retinal color images are partitioned into non-overlapping segments covering the entire image. Each segment, i.e., splat, contains pixels with similar color and spatial location. A novel method for automated generalised generation of splat is presented in this paper and further marking of the diseased splats is also proposed.

Whenever there is a need to establish communication and provide service to MSs, the network has to track the location of the MSs through the base station. Tracking the location of the MSs is a very difficult and complex problem in the WiMAX network. This paper discusses a location area planning problem, which can be solved by partitioning the WiMAX network into location areas, so that the cost per call arrival is minimum. Finding the optimal number of location areas and the corresponding configuration of the partitioned network is an NP-complete problem. In this study, we use nature inspired techniques, namely, genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC) and artificial immune system (AIS) to find an optimal solution to the location area planning problem. The performance is analysed and compared for all these nature inspired techniques. In this study, we also compare these techniques to gauge their suitability for solving the location area planning problem. From the obtained results, we conclude that ABC gives better optimal solution and AIS takes less computational time to locate the optimal solution.

Efficient routing for dynamically changing network and unstable wireless medium is a challenging task. The conventional AODV routing protocol works on selecting the hop count-based shortest path while delivering the packet towards the destination. This often creates uneven load distribution among network nodes. As a result, any central node hopelessly carries heavier loads that significantly deplete node energy with higher packet loss and delay in processing. In this work, a protocol based on power and delay named as power and delay optimised AODV (PDO-AODV) has been presented which is based on load balanced routing strategy in AODV that improves the quality of service for MANETs. The proposed approach takes neighbouring node's power and delay into consideration for selecting load balanced path. Simulation results manifest that the proposed PDO-AODV achieves improved performance as compared to existing AODV routing protocol in terms of packet drop, network delay, throughput, and retransmission attempts.","Delay; Load balancing; MANET; Mobile ad hoc network; Packet delivery ratio; PDR; Power","Ad hoc networks; Network routing; Packet loss; Packet networks; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Routing protocols; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; AODV routing protocol; Delay; Innovative research; MANET; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Packet delivery ratio; Power; Wireless communications; Mobile ad hoc networks","Rath, M.; Department of Information Technology, C.V.

Whenever a use with a cellular phone changes its location, his location must be updated to the database so that the same can be reached later on. Some devices remain almost stationary as they don’t move out of a specific area like an office or a home. At the same time, some devices move frequently as the users are carrying them while travelling. In every case, if location updates are not properly performed, users will not get connectivity all the time.

In this regard several investigations are carried out to ascertain the effect of slot position on antenna performance. In addition to this bevel slots are cut at corners and its effect on antenna performance is studied. Compact wideband antennas are gaining popularity in view of their features like large bandwidth, low power consumption, low complexity, low cost etc. Many researches are working to obtain an optimum arrangement for the UWB monopole antenna. In this paper several configurations of wideband antennas are designed, tested and their performance is compared. One arrangement is a compact patch with slot cut at different locations. Another arrangement is the earlier one with two symmetrical bevel cuts on the lower edge of the radiating element. In both schemes a defective ground plane structure (DGS) is used. Further the ground plane dimensions are varied and effect of this on performance is studied. The design and performance evaluation is carried out using HFSS software.

However it is often a complex process to differentiate abnormalities due to the ill-defined margins and subtle appearances. Method This paper investigates a new computer aided approach to detect the abnormalities in the digital mammograms using a Dual Stage Adaptive Thresholding (DuSAT). The suspicious mass region is identified using global histogram and local window thresholding method. The global thresholding is done based on the Histogram Peak Analysis (HPA) of the entire image and the threshold is obtained by maximizing the proposed threshold selection criteria. The local thresholding is carried out for each pixel in a defined neighborhood window that provides precise segmentation results. Results The algorithm is verified with 300 images in the DDSM database and 170 images in the mini-MIAS database. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average sensitivity of 92.5% with 1.06 FP/image for DDSM database and an average sensitivity of 93.5% with 0.62 FP/image for mini-MIAS database. Conclusion The achieved results depict that the proposed approach provides better results compared to other state-of-art methods for mass detection that helps the radiologists in diagnosis of breast cancer at early stage. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Adaptive thresholding; Between-class standard deviation; Breast cancer; Computer aided detection; Histogram peak analysis","Computer aided diagnosis; Database systems; Diseases; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Mammography; X ray screens; Adaptive thresholding; Breast Cancer; Computer aided detection; Peak analysis; Standard deviation; Computer aided analysis; algorithm; Article; artifact reduction; breast cancer; breast tumor; cancer diagnosis; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; dual stage adaptive thresholding; false positive result; female; histogram; histogram peak analysis; human; image analysis; image segmentation; local window thresholding method; major clinical study; mammography; noise reduction; pectoral muscle; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity analysis; automation; Breast Neoplasms; diagnostic imaging; mammography; procedures; Automation; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Mammography; Pectoralis Muscles","Anitha, J.; Department of CSE, Karunya UniversityIndia; email: anitha_j@karunya.edu",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"27886719","English","Comput.

This paper presents an alternative approach for unsupervised segmentation of natural and medical images to improve the separation between objects in the framework of multi-objective optimization. In contrast to the existing single-objective optimization and entropy-based methods, a multi-objective framework is adopted by combining two objectives based on the Minimum Cross Entropy (MCE) and Rényi Entropy (RE). One of the most competitive Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) of current interest, called MOEA/D-DE (Decomposition based MOEA with Differential Evolution) is then applied to determine the set of Pareto optimal solutions for these two objectives. The threshold values for multi-level segmentations are obtained from the approximated Pareto Fronts (PFs) generated by MOEA/D-DE. The performance of MOEA/D-DE is also investigated extensively through comparison with other popular nature-inspired single-objective and multi-objective optimizers. Moreover, outcome of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing against the results of other well cited algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively on test-suites comprising well-known natural and medical test images in order to showcase the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Brain tumor detection; Decomposition based multi-objective optimization (MOEA/D); Image segmentation; Multi-level thresholding; Pareto fronts (PFs)","Entropy; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Brain tumors; Differential Evolution; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multilevel thresholding; Pareto front; Pareto optimal solutions; Single objective optimization; Unsupervised segmentation; Evolutionary algorithms","Das, S.; Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: swagatamdas19@yahoo.co.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

Therefore, an adequate Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is designed for classification of brain tumor for assisting inexperience radiologists in diagnosis process. A multifarious database of real post contrast T1-weighted MR images from 10 patients has been taken. This database consists of primary brain tumors namely Meningioma (MENI-class 1), Astrocytoma (AST-class 2), and Normal brain regions (NORM-class 3). The region of interest(s) (ROIs) of size 20 x 20 is extracted by the radiologists from each image in the database. A total of 371 texture and intensity features are extracted from these ROI(s). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to classify these three classes as it shows better classification results on multivariate non-linear, complicated, rule based domains, and decision making domains. It is being observed that ANN provides much accurate results in terms of individual classification accuracy and overall classification accuracy. The four discrete experiments have been performed. Initially, the experiment was performed by extracting 263 features and an overall classification accuracy 78.10% is achieved, however, it was noticed that MENI (class-1) was highly misclassified with AST (class-2). Further, to improve the overall classification accuracy and individual classification accuracy specifically for MENI (class-1), LAWs textural energy measures (LTEM) are added in the feature bank (263+108=371). An individual class accuracy of 91.40% is obtained for MENI (class-1), 91.43% for AST (class-2), 94.29% for NORM (class-3) and an overall classification accuracy of 92.43% is achieved. The results are calculated with and without addition of LTEM feature with Principle component analysis (PCA)-ANN. LTEM-PCA-ANN approach improved results with an overall accuracy of 93.34%. The texture patterns obtained were clear enough to differentiate between MENI (class-1) and AST (class-2) despite of necrotic and cystic component and location and size of tumor. LTEM detected fundamental texture properties such as level, edge, spot, wave and ripple in both horizontal and vertical directions which boosted the texture energy. © 2017, the Authors.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Computer aided diagnosis (CAD); Graphical user interface (GUI); Magnetic resonance (MR); Region of interest(s) (ROIs)","Artificial intelligence; Brain; Database systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Graphical user interfaces; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Tumors; User interfaces; Classification accuracy; Classification results; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Primary brain tumors; Principle component analysis; Region of interest; Computer aided diagnosis",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",18756891,,,,"English","Int.

The unsupervised nature of the problem makes it widely applicable and also tough to solve objectively. Clustering in the context of image data is referred to as image segmentation. Distance based methods such as K-means fail to detect the non-globular clusters and hence spectral clustering was proposed to overcome this problem. This method detects the non globular structures by projecting the data set into a subspace, in which the usual clustering methods work well. Gamma convergence is the study of asymptotic behavior of minimizers of a family of minimization problems. Such a limit of minimizers is referred to as the gamma limit. Calculating the gamma limit for various variational problems has been proved useful - giving a different algorithm and insights into why existing methods work. In this article, we calculate the gamma limit of the spectral clustering methods, analyze its properties, and compare them with minimum spanning tree based clustering methods and spectral clustering methods. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Cluster analysis; Geometry; Image segmentation; Asymptotic behaviors; Distance-based methods; Globular structure; Minimization problems; Minimum spanning trees; Spectral clustering; Spectral clustering methods; Variational problems; Clustering algorithms","Challa, A.; Systems Science and Informatics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 8th Mile, Mysore Road, India; email: aditya.challa.20@gmail.com","Kropatsch W.G.Artner N.M.Janusch I.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319662718,,,"English","Lect.

The popular Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm perform well in the absence of noise, but it is non robust to noise as it makes use of the Euclidean distance and does not exploit the spatial information of the image. These limitations can be addressed by using the Robust Spatial Kernel FCM (RSKFCM) algorithm that takes advantage of the spatial information and uses a Gaussian kernel function to calculate the distance between the center and data points. Though RSKFCM gives a good result, the main drawback of this method is the inability of obtaining good minima for the objective function as it happens for many other clustering algorithms. To improve the efficiency of RSKFCM method, in this paper, we proposed the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm based RSKFCM (ACORSKFCM). By using the Ant Colony Optimization, RSKFCM initializes the cluster centers and reaches good minima of the objective function. Experimental results carried out on the standard medical datasets like Brain, Lungs, Liver and Breast images. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms many other FCM variants.

The HSI color model is used to get the color information of the given image. The boundary of the image is extracted by using edge detection algorithm, whereas, the image regions are filled where the boundaries make the closure. Both HSI color information and edge detection are applied separately and simultaneously. The color segmented image is obtained by taking the union of HSI color information and edge detection. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with existing region-growing algorithm by considering three parameters, precision (P), recall (R) and F1 value. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is also measured by using precision-recall (PR) and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been tested on more than 1500 images from UCD (University College Dublin) image dataset and other resources. The experiment results show that the efficiency of proposed algorithm is found very significant.

Several authors have put forward various authentication protocols for multi-server environment during the past decade. Wang et al. recently proposed a biometric-based authentication with key agreement protocol for multi-server environment and claimed that their protocol is efficient and resistant to prominent security attacks. The careful investigation of this paper shows that Wang et al. protocol's users are sharing personal identifiable information with the application servers during the registration and authentication process. This nature of disclosing credentials leads to severe threats particularly insider attacks, user impersonation attacks, and server impersonation attacks. As a remedy of the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a novel biometric-based mutually authenticated key agreement protocols for multi-server architecture based on elliptic curve cryptography. We prove that the proposed protocol achieves secure mutual authentication property using the broadly used Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. The formal security of the proposed protocol is verified using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool to show that our protocol can withstand active and passive attacks including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks.

A number of high performing texture algorithms are based on the concept of local binary patterns (LBP) characterising the relationships of pixels to their local neighbourhood. LBP descriptors are simple to calculate, are invariant to intensity changes and can be calculated in a rotation invariant manner as well as at different scales. Incorporating variance information, leading to LBP variance (LBPV) texture descriptors, has been claimed to lead to more versatile and more effective texture features. In this paper, we investigate this in more detail, benchmarking and contrasting the classification performance of several LBP and LBPV descriptors for generic image texture classification as well as two medical tasks. We show that while LBPV-based methods typically lead to improved classification performance this is not always so and that thus the inclusion of variance information is task dependent. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Benchmarking; Big data; Classification (of information); Image segmentation; Image texture; Medical imaging; Classification performance; Imaging applications; Intensity change; Local binary patterns; Rotation invariant; Texture classification; Texture descriptors; Variance information; Data mining","Schaefer, G.; Department of Computer Science, Loughborough UniversityUnited Kingdom","Takagi H.Shi Y.Tan Y.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319618449,,,"English","Lect.

Then the well-known Grab Cut method is adapted for foreground segmentation from the upper body image. Next, the pictorial structural model has been used for torso detection with the help of conditional random field (CRF).

Analyzing their calls would not only enable us to better understand these species but would also give insights into the evolution of human languages and vocal tract. This paper describes a technique to discover the patterns in marmoset vocalization in an unsupervised fashion. The proposed unsupervised clustering approach operates in two stages. Initially, voice activity detection (VAD) is applied to remove silences and non-voiced regions from the audio. This is followed by a group-delay based segmentation on the voiced regions to obtain smaller segments. In the second stage, a two-tier clustering is performed on the segments obtained. Individual hidden Markov models (HMMs) are built for each of the segments using a multiple frame size and multiple frame rate. The HMMs are then clustered until each cluster is made up of a large number of segments. Once all the clusters get enough number of segments, one Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is built for each of the clusters. These clusters are then merged using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The algorithm converges to the total number of distinct sounds in the audio, as evidenced by listening tests.

It is expected that more than twenty billion smart devices are deployed around the globe by 2020. The machines talk to each other and communicate with cloud based MTC servers to monitor and control everything around us. Such ubiquitous sensing and actuating require a communication infrastructure. Cellular networks due to their wide coverage are the best candidate for the communication infrastructure. The 3GPP LTE system is the future cellular network. Access class barring (ACB) is introduced by the standard as a solution to alleviate the congestion at the access layer. It works as a persistent probability for network access at the data link layer. In this paper, we consider an MTC system with several devices using LTE system as communication network. Based on the suggestions of the 3GPP standard, we consider uniform activation of devices within a long interval. This activation pattern results in Poisson arrival traffic in each random access channel. Using this arrival traffic pattern, we obtain the ACB factor which maximizes the throughput in the access link. This factor depends on the traffic parameters.

While large datasets of unlabeled image data are available in medical applications, access to manually labeled data is very limited. We propose to automatically create auxiliary labels on initially unlabeled data with existing tools and to use them for pre-training. For the subsequent fine-tuning of the network with manually labeled data, we introduce error corrective boosting (ECB), which emphasizes parameter updates on classes with lower accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce SkipDeconv-Net (SD-Net), a new F-CNN architecture for brain segmentation that combines skip connections with the unpooling strategy for upsampling. The SD-Net addresses challenges of severe class imbalance and errors along boundaries. With application to whole-brain MRI T1 scan segmentation, we generate auxiliary labels on a large dataset with FreeSurfer and fine-tune on two datasets with manual annotations. Our results show that the inclusion of auxiliary labels and ECB yields significant improvements. SD-Net segments a 3D scan in 7 s in comparison to 30 h for the closest multi-atlas segmentation method, while reaching similar performance. It also outperforms the latest state-of-the-art F-CNN models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Convolution; Deep neural networks; Errors; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical applications; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Semantics; Brain segmentation; Class imbalance; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Manual annotation; Segmentation methods; Semantic image segmentations; State of the art; Image segmentation","Roy, A.G.; Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (AI-Med), KJP, LMU MünchenGermany; email: abhijit.guha-roy@tum.de","Maier-Hein L.Franz A.Jannin P.Duchesne S.Descoteaux M.Collins D.L.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319661780,,,"English","Lect.

Traditional manual interpretation method cannot yield high accuracy. (Method) In this study, we proposed a novel computer-aided diagnosis system for detecting abnormal breasts in mammogram images. First, we segmented the region-of-interest. Next, the weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT) was employed to obtain the unified time-frequency spectrum. Third, principal component analysis (PCA) was introduced and used to reduce the spectrum to only 18 principal components. Fourth, feed-forward neural network (FNN) was utilized to generate the classifier. Finally, a novel algorithm-specific parameter free approach, Jaya, was employed to train the classifier. (Results) Our proposed WFRFT + PCA + Jaya-FNN achieved sensitivity of 92.26%±3.44%, specificity of 92.28%±3.58%, and accuracy of 92.27%±3.49%. (Conclusions) The proposed CAD system is effective in detecting abnormal breasts and performs better than 5 state-of-the-art systems. Besides, Jaya is more effective in training FNN than BP, MBP, GA, SA, and PSO.","Abnormal breast detection; Computer-aided diagnosis; Feedforward neural network; Fractional Fourier transform; Jaya algorithm; Mammogram","Computer aided diagnosis; Feedforward neural networks; Fourier transforms; Image segmentation; Mammography; Medical imaging; Plasma diagnostics; X ray screens; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Fractional Fourier transforms; Interpretation methods; Mammogram; Principal Components; State-of-the-art system; Time-frequency spectrum; Weightedtype fractional fourier transform (WFRFT); Principal component analysis","Zhang, Y.; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of 3D, Printing Equipment and ManufacturingChina; email: zhangyudong@njnu.edu.cn",,"IOS Press",01692968,,FUINE,,"English","Fundam Inf",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015380071

In previous studies, this stratification has been mainly based on analysis of the far wall of the carotid artery. Due to the multifocal nature of atherosclerotic disease, the plaque growth is not restricted to the far wall alone. This paper presents a new approach for stroke risk assessment by integrating assessment of both the near and far walls of the carotid artery using grayscale morphology of the plaque. Further, this paper presents a scientific validation system for stroke risk assessment. Both these innovations have never been presented before. The methodology consists of an automated segmentation system of the near wall and far wall regions in grayscale carotid B-mode ultrasound scans. Sixteen grayscale texture features are computed, and fed into the machine learning system. The training system utilizes the lumen diameter to create ground truth labels for the stratification of stroke risk. The cross-validation procedure is adapted in order to obtain the machine learning testing classification accuracy through the use of three sets of partition protocols: (5, 10, and Jack Knife). The mean classification accuracy over all the sets of partition protocols for the automated system in the far and near walls is 95.08% and 93.47%, respectively. The corresponding accuracies for the manual system are 94.06% and 92.02%, respectively. The precision of merit of the automated machine learning system when compared against manual risk assessment system are 98.05% and 97.53% for the far and near walls, respectively. The ROC of the risk assessment system for the far and near walls is close to 1.0 demonstrating high accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carotid wall; Far; Machine learning; Near; Precision of merit; ROC; Segmentation; Stroke; Ultrasound","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Morphology; Ultrasonics; Automated segmentation; Carotid wall; Classification accuracy; Grayscale morphology; Near; Precision of merit; Risk stratification; Stroke; Risk assessment; adult; aged; arterial wall thickness; Article; atherosclerotic plaque; automation; carotid artery; cerebrovascular accident; clinical assessment; clinical feature; clinical protocol; controlled study; coronary risk; echography; female; high risk patient; human; low risk patient; machine learning; major clinical study; male; priority journal; real time ultrasound scanner; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; tissue characterization; validation process; carotid artery; carotid artery disease; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; echography; image processing; machine learning; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; risk assessment; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Stroke; Ultrasonography","Suri, J.S.United States; email: Jasjit.Suri@atheropoint.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"27915126","English","Comput.
