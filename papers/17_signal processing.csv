One of the approaches to measure the Teager energy is using Teager Energy Operator. But the usage of Teager Energy Operator is limited by two restrictions. Firstly, the differences between the instantaneous amplitudes and digital frequencies of the adjacent samples of the signal should be very small. Secondly, the energy of the process that generates a signal is in agreement when the digital frequency of the signal is also small. Another approach to measure Teager energy is by using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) which makes the use of instantaneous energy expression. This energy expression used for the Teager energy ensures that the energy is always positive, and it is in agreement with the energy required to generate a signal. But the Empirical Mode Decomposition process results in Mode-Mixing problem. The proposed algorithm utilizes the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to resolve the Mode-Mixing problem. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; HilbertHuang transform; Teager energy operator,Mathematical transformations; Mixing; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Energy expression; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Hilbert Huang transforms; Instantaneous amplitude; Teager energies; Teager energy operators; Signal processing,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are associated with gene regulation and gene silencing and thus have wide applications in biological sciences. Also, the functionality of miRNA is highly associated with its secondary structures (stem, bulge and loop). Signal processing methods have been previously applied on genomic data to reveal the periodicities that determine a wide variety of biological functions, ranging from exon detection to microsatellite identification in DNA sequences. However, there has been less focus on RNA-based signal processing. Here, we show that the signal processing method can be successfully applied to miRNA sequences. We observed that these periodicities are highly correlated with the secondary structure of miRNA and such methods could possibly be used as indicators of secondary and tertiary structure formation. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",microRNA (miRNA); modified S-transform; RNA sequences; secondary structure elements,DNA; microRNA; analytic method; Article; biological functions; DNA sequence; gene control; gene silencing; modified S transform method; periodicity; priority journal; protein secondary structure; RNA sequence; signal processing,"Yennamalli, R.M.; Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Jaypee University of Information TechnologyIndia; email: ym.ragothaman@juit.ac.in",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,18959091,,,,English,Bio-Algorithms Med-Syst.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040365714

Usually SI is suppressed by reconstructing it using the transmit signal and subtracting it at the FD receiver. For good cancellation, an accurate estimate of the SI channel is essential. However, training for obtaining the SI channel in the presence of intended received signal requires a large training period. This can be addressed by designating a separate training period during which received signal is turned off, and the SI channel is estimated. However having a separate training period impacts the overall achievable rate. In this paper, we propose a technique that exploits the structure of the received signal to train for SI channel in the presence of received signal. Specifically, we propose a time domain symmetric preamble packet in the received signal to create effective samples in which the received signal is absent. Further, we bound the variance of the channel estimates thus obtained and observe that the performance is same as that of having a separate training period. The performance of the proposed technique is also evaluated by an experiment setup. © 2017 IEEE.",,Finite difference method; Separation; Signal interference; Signal processing; Time domain analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channel estimate; Experiment set-up; Full-duplex; Full-duplex radios; Received signals; Self-interferences; Time domain; Signal receivers,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,IEEE Workshop Signal Process.

Cascade design is used for IA precoder design, where the first component precoder is obtained by MSE minimization and the second component of the cascade precoder is computed using zero forcing to null the intra-group interference. The resultant design is iterated to obtain the optimal precoder-decoder for IA. In simulations, the algorithm is analyzed for convergence, SNR behavior, and precoder initialization sensitiveness.

The method is based on the sparse signal decomposition (SSD) with overcomplete hybrid dictionary (OHD) matrix including impulse and sinusoidal waveforms derived from discrete impulse, sine and cosine functions, and 1-norm optimization algorithm. The SSD technique decomposes an audio signal into two parts: an approximation part including the sinusoidal components; and a detail part including the impulsive and background noise components. Results show that the impulse waveforms can adequately capture clicks, pops and record scratches in audio signals meanwhile the sinusoids of the OHD matrix can effectively capture sinusoidal components. For performance comparison purpose, four restoration methods are implemented based on the representation dictionaries, median filter, and signal dependent rank order mean techniques. The methods are validated using audio signals extracted from old archive Indian and English movies and standard music database. The quality of the restored audio signals is evaluated using both subjective quality and objective quality metrics. Results show that the proposed method effectively removes impulsive noises without degrading the perceived audio quality and its intelligibility as compared to the existing restoration methods. © 2017 IEEE.",,Acoustic noise; Audio acoustics; Cosine transforms; Impulse noise; Median filters; Optimization; Restoration; Impulsive disturbances; Objective qualities; Optimization algorithms; Performance comparison; Simultaneous detection; Sinusoidal components; Sinusoidal waveforms; Sparse representation; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044209903

We propose a Rényi Divergence based Covariance Matching Pursuit (RD-CMP) algorithm which recovers the common support of the joint sparse signals as the hyperparameters of a joint sparsity inducing Gaussian signal prior. The support hyperparameters are learned as a set variable by solving a reverse information projection problem based on the ?-Rényi information divergence. We show that the ?-Rényi divergence objective can be expressed as a difference of two submodular functions, and propose an iterative majorization-minimization procedure to minimize the objective, with each iteration involving a greedy optimization. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed RD-CMP algorithm is capable of recovering k-sparse support from fewer than k measurements per signal.

Detection of MI by consideration of fewer ECG leads requires prior information of the pathological characteristics of the disease. Thus, here we have considered all the 12 leads of the ECG signal simultaneously for detection of MI. Wavelet transform of all the leads of MI decomposes the signal into subbands of different order. The multiscale energy of all the bands are computed and the normalized multiscale energy of the wavelet coefficients are considered. The pathological structure present in the ECG data alters the covariance structure of the subband matrix and thus changes in the feature parameters of the signal occur, which leads to detection of MI.

This pulse diagnosis technique commonly known as the 'Nadi Pariksha' has been recognized not only for monitoring the health status of patients but also for identifying the root cause of the disorder. However, it requires experience and expertise to learn, as a result, this highly promising technique is disappearing rapidly in the modern healthcare system. There is an acute need to save this proven and versatile art of investigating diseases based on very fundamentals of the biological system. In the past, research has been carried out for the computational pulse diagnosis, where sensors are used to acquire the nadi pulse wave for signal processing. Reliable acquisition of the pulse signal is an essential requirement for pulse based health monitoring and sensor's performance greatly affects the faithfulness of the signal to be processed. Therefore, in this work, the performance comparison of different pressure sensors is carried out for the design and development of wrist pulse acquisition system. The pressure sensors, used for pulse signal measurement can be grouped into two major categories i.e. piezoelectric and piezoresistive sensor.

In this paper, we consider MBM for the uplink of a massive MIMO system, which has not been reported before. Each user is equipped with one transmit antenna with multiple radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) placed near it. The base station (BS) is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive antennas. We investigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) in a massive MIMO setting. Our results show that multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) can significantly outperform other modulation schemes. For example, a bit error performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the BS in a massive MIMO system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas using MU-MBM. Even multiuser spatial modulation and generalized spatial modulation in the same massive MIMO settings require more than 200 antennas to achieve the same bit error performance. Also, recognizing that the MU-MBM signal vectors are inherently sparse, we propose an efficient MU-MBM signal detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), and subspace pursuit (SP). © 2017 IEEE.",CoSaMP; Massive MIMO; Media-based modulation; OMP; RF mirrors; Sparse recovery; Subspace pursuit,Compressed sensing; MIMO systems; Mirrors; Receiving antennas; Signal processing; Vectors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Compressive sampling matching pursuits; CoSaMP; Massive MIMO; Massive MIMO systems; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Reconstruction algorithms; Sparse recovery; Subspace pursuits; Modulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,IEEE Workshop Signal Process.

This papers consists of two major studies, singing-voice analysis and music-source separation. Indian ragas are divided into lyrical composition and alaap regions, i.e., regions of improvisation that indicate versatility of the singer. Acoustic analyses of both male and female singing voice is carried out by examining the production characteristics. The source feature F0 is obtained using two methods, autocorrelation of linear prediction (LP) residual and zero-frequency filtering (ZFF), for cross-validation. Combined source-filter feature signal energy is examined to identify the regions of alaap and lyrics composition. Spectrogram using short-time Fourier transform are used for validating the results. The music-source separation is carried out using spectral components and exploiting the repetitive nature in the Indian classical music. A measure of separation quality is proposed using a self-similarity matrix technique, which helps in selecting optimal windowing configurations. Performance evaluation results are encouraging. Study helps making the near-ideal choices of the windowing techniques for better separation of lyric (foreground) and the music part (background) in the music-singing voice mixture.

In general, fMRI records a combination of neural activation signals and several other noisy components. Alternatively, fMRI data is represented as a high dimensional array using a number of voxels, time instants, and snapshots. The organisation of fMRI data includes a number of Region Of Interests (ROI), snapshots, and thousand of voxels. The crucial step in cognitive task classification is a reduction of feature size through feature selection. Extraction of a specific pattern of interest within the noisy components is a challenging task. Tensor decomposition techniques have found several applications in the scientific fields. In this paper, a novel tensor gradient-based feature extraction technique for cognitive task classification is proposed. The technique has efficiently been applied on StarPlus fMRI data. Also, the technique has been used to discriminate the ROIs in fMRI data in terms of cognitive state classification.

In our earlier studies, acoustic analysis was carried out to characterize the infant cry signal due to different cause of crying. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Cry Monitoring and Cry Detection System (ICMCDS) that can help working parents who are constrained to leave their children with the care-takers, and remain worried about their well-being. They need to be notified when their child cries. Functional prototype of a smart ICMCDS is developed at low-cost, which can monitor a child in real-time. Signal processing methods auto-correlation and a recently proposed modified zero-frequency filtering are used for cry-detection. Features F0, Strength of Excitation and Signal Energy are extracted from the cry signal. Parameters mean, standard deviation and normalized standard deviation in F0 are derived. Acoustic analysis of the cry signal helps detecting a cry as well as the cry-cause. The system detects a cry and informs the parent automatically through sms. If the child-cry continues for some time, then the intelligent system sends a second message, raising urgency concern. Further the system also identifies the likely cause of crying by examining the features, and informs to the parents by a third sms. The concerned parent may talk to a human controller, who in-turn can give control commands to a robot, using a webpage or mobile phone. The robot, equipped with audio-visual sensors, can be sent near to the child to get the actual state, by sending back live video streaming of the child and surroundings. It also validates the alert message about child crying. Wi-Fi medium is used for communication between humans and the robot. Performance evaluation is carried out using an Infant Cry Signals Database (IIITS ICSD 2).

But human-computer interaction can be improved by automated emotions recognition, thereby reducing the need of human intervention. In this paper, four basic emotions (Anger, Happy, Fear and Neutral) are analyzed from emotional speech signals. Signal processing methods are used for obtaining the production features from these signals. Source feature the instantaneous fundamental frequency (F0), system features the formants and dominant frequencies, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and the combined features signal energy are used for the analyses. F0 is obtained using zero-frequency filtering (ZFF), and formants and dominant frequencies using LP spectrum. Short-time signal energy (STE) and ZCR are obtained in the voiced and unvoiced regions using a rectangular window of 200 samples. Two databases, German and Telugu Emotion Databases are used to cross-validate the results. Distinct differences are observed between high-arousal emotions (Anger and Happy) and Neutral emotion. Results indicate overlap between Anger and Happy emotions. But distinct differences are observed in the features for Happy/Anger and Fear, and between Happy and Anger emotions which is otherwise a challenging problem.

To meet these requirements selection of precise modulation scheme is essential. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a reconfigurable modulator which is capable of performing modulation schemes that can effectively counter the limitations listed above. The proposed modulator can perform modulation schemes such as Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Minimum Shift Keying (MSK), Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) and Unbalanced Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (UQPSK). Reconfiguration is an advanced technique for system design, wherein the same hardware resources can be reconfigured to provide different functionalities. The proposed modulator can dynamically reconfigure between modulation schemes as per the user requirement without any changes in the hardware. The proposed modulator is implemented on Virtex-5 FPGA.

Further, to investigate the interaction between induction algorithm and wavelet basis, two induction algorithms were included: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB). The results of the investigation convincingly demonstrate that 'db18' from the Daubechies family provides the best overall performance among 110 wavelet bases included in this study. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; power quality; signal processing; wavelet basis selection; wavelet packet transform,Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Nearest neighbor search; Power quality; Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Daubechies; Induction algorithms; K-nearest neighbors; Naive bayes; Power quality event; Wavelet basis; Wavelet basis selection; Wavelet packet transforms; Wavelet transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044208985

The design problem is usually formulated into a maximization of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), subject to waveform constraints. A widely used approach is the alternating optimization scheme combined with the rank-one constrained SDP programming. In this paper, a new algorithm based on the majorization-minimization (MM) method is proposed. This algorithm is not only capable of dealing with various waveform constraints, but also computationally efficient. Furthermore, its connection to the alternating optimization approach is also revealed.

Generally, the underwater images are whisked by blurring effect, scattering effect etc. because of poor lighting condition. EMD is a signal decompose algorithm which is particularly useful for non-stationary and non-linear signals. First of all, the image is processed through the Gray World technique which is a white balance approach to enhance the contrast of the image and to remove the unwanted color cast in the image. Then, each R, G and B channel of the resultant image is decomposed into its Intrinsic Mode Functions(IMFs). Final enhanced image has been constructed by combining the IMFs of each channel with different optimised weights. The EMD algorithm is implemented on the resultant image of White balanced process to restore the color. Our experimental results enhance the contrast of the image by reducing noise as well as artifacts in the image. To show the quantitative enhanced result, Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix(GLCM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Mean Square Error(MSE) are calculated and compared with different conventional enhancement methods.

The objective of feature extraction is to extract features from speech and captures the unique characteristics of a individual speaker. The proposed method can be used in noisy environment with high degree of accuracy. The proposed method is based on the wavelet transform and the input speech signal is decomposed into various frequency channels. The purpose of Wavelet transform is to find the frequency spectrum while wavelet cepstral coefficient is used to capture the characteristic of the signal. It is more suitable than Fourier transform because it is restricted in both time and frequency whereas fourier transform is only restricted in frequency. The proposed method is capable to reduce the noise as well as also improves recognition effectively. Fuzzy rules are used for decision making.

LDN comprises of several such sensor nodes distributed in a certain geographical area which captures lightning signals. The single sensor node system consists of the antenna, analog circuit front end, and digital back end. These sensor nodes then transmit lightning data in real time to central lightning location system (CLLS) which calculates the exact location of the lightning stroke. We have designed and implement cost effective digital back-end system for a sensor node which digitizes analog signals and performs some signal processing in the digital domain before sending the data to CLLS. Analog front-end receives and amplifies lightning very low frequency signal (VLF) signals, then presented digital system samples the analog signals at a rate of 1 Mega samples per second. This is followed by digital filtering and digital down conversion; after which the data samples are time-stamped with the corresponding real time (UTC time) then this data is sent to CLLS by UART link. This digital design has been simulated and implemented on the Xilinx Spartan 6 series lx9csg324 FPGA board. Presented digital system has been tested on LabVIEW GUI and Xilinx ChipScope pro analyzer and received signals spectrogram has been calculated.

Load disaggregation comes handy for this purpose. Every appliance can be classified based upon its own unique signature.

Background subtraction is one of the prime methods for automatic video analysis. The sensitivity of a meaningful event of interest is increased due to dampening effect of background changes and detection of false alarm. Hence the model can be strongly recommended to industries. This paper restricts the focus to one of the most common causes of dynamic background changes: that of swaying trees branches and illumination changes. To overcome the issue available in existing system, we propose a method called as twin background modeling. This method has dual models namely long and short term background models to increase exposure rate of foreground by using statistical method and also reduce false negative rate. This method has dimensional transformation from 2D to 1D which reduces computation time of the system and increases batch processing.

In recent years, many speech recognition systems have been developed to solve various issues in real world applications. We have proposed a novel speech recognition system using enhanced mel frequency cepstral coefficient with windowing and framing method. Windowing and framing method is used to remove the Gaussian white noise present in the input speech signal. The de-noising block effectively uses the nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for factorizing the Mel-magnitude spectra of noisy input audio signal. Moreover, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is used for finding the more important features exist in the speech signal. Finally, Laplace smoothing technique is used as the language model for recognizing the audio signals. MATLAB software is used for demonstrating the proposed Mel frequency cepstral coefficient with Windowing and Framing based speech recognition system.

In existing methods, voicing decision relies mostly on fundamental frequency F0, which may result in errors when the prediction is inaccurate. Even though F0 is a glottal activity feature, other features that characterize this activity may help in improving the voicing decision. The glottal activity features used in this work are the strength of excitation (SoE), normalized autocorrelation peak strength (NAPS), and higher-order statistics (HOS). These features obtained from approximated source signals like zero-frequency filtered signal and integrated linear prediction residual. To improve voicing decision and to avoid heuristic threshold for classification, glottal activity features are trained using different statistical learning methods such as the k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and deep belief network. The voicing decision works best with SVM classifier, and its effectiveness is tested using the statistical parametric speech synthesis. The glottal activity features SoE, NAPS, and HOS modeled along with F0 and Mel-cepstral coefficients in Hidden Markov model and deep neural network to get the voicing decision.

The proposed technique is based on recently developed signal decomposition technique known as Hilbert vibration decomposition (HVD). In the proposed method, the histogram equalised PAN image is decomposed into many instantaneous amplitude (IA) and frequency components in the decreasing order of energy using the HVD. The IA of the first component (having highest energy) in the decomposition of the PAN image is used to generate the pansharpened image using appropriate pansharpening model. The tuning factor associated with the pansharpening model is optimised by single-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. This method is also extended for the hyperspectral images. Experimental results of the proposed technique are compared with existing pansharpening methods in terms of both visual perception and objective metrics.

Diagnostic methods of this ailment by physicians are typically invasive, even though they do not fulfill the required detection accuracy. Methods Recent feature extraction methods, for example, Auto Regressive (AR) modelling; Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC); Wavelet Coherence (WTC) using Physionet database, yielded a collection of huge feature set. A large number of these features may be inconsequential containing some excess and non-discriminative components that present excess burden in computation and loss of execution performance.

However, existing methods suffer with the challenge of greater artifacts at high acceleration factors. This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI collection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed method based on l1?l1 norm constraints, wherein we impose first l1-norm sparsity on the voxel time series (temporal data) in the transformed domain and the second l1-norm sparsity on the successive difference of the same temporal data. Hence, we name the proposed method as Double Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly evaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data. Results are presented at various acceleration factors. Quantitative analysis in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative analysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs) demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the proposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying fMRI data. Compared to the existing methods, the DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10-12 dB in PSNR with acceleration factors upto 3.5 on resting state fMRI data. Simulation results on real data demonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with accurate detection of RSNs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Accelerated functional MRI; Compressed sensing; k-t acceleration; l1 minimization; Sparse recovery; Undersampling,"Compressed sensing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Acceleration factors; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Functional MRI; Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Qualitative analysis; Reconstruction method; Sparse recovery; Under-sampling; Signal to noise ratio; acceleration; Article; artifact; brain size; brain slice; connectome; controlled study; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human tissue; measurement; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality control; quantitative analysis; resting state network; signal noise ratio; adolescent; adult; algorithm; brain; diagnostic imaging; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; signal processing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult","Aggarwal, P.; Signal Processing and Bio-medical Imaging Lab, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT)India; email: priyaa@iiitd.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,29101794,English,Comput.

Patients confidential data is embedded in ECG (called stego-ECG) using chaotic map and the sample value difference approach. The sample value difference approach effectually hides the patients confidential data in ECG sample pairs at the predefined locations. The chaotic map generates these predefined locations through the use of selective control parameters. Subsequently, the wireless transmission of the stego-ECG is analyzed using the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system in a Rayleigh fading scenario for telemedicine applications. Evaluation of proposed method on all 48 records of MIT-BIH arrhythmia ECG database demonstrates that the embedding does not alter the diagnostic features of cover ECG. The secret data imperceptibility in stego-ECG is evident through the statistical and clinical performance measures. Statistical measures comprise of Percentage Root-mean-square Difference (PRD), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Kulback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div), etc. while clinical metrics includes wavelet Energy Based Diagnostic Distortion (WEDD) and Wavelet based Weighted PRD (WWPRD). The various channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio scenarios are simulated for wireless communication of stego-ECG in OFDM system.

The slope failures are due to adverse inherent geological conditions triggered by an external factor. This paper proposes a new method for the prediction of displacement of step-like landslides, by accounting the controlling factors, using recently proposed extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. ELANFIS reduces the computational complexity of conventional ANFIS by incorporating the theoretical idea of extreme learning machines (ELM). The rainfall data and reservoir level elevation data are also integrated into the study. The nonlinear original landslide displacement series, rainfall data, and reservoir level elevation data are first converted into a limited number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and one residue. Then decomposed displacement data are predicted by using appropriate ELANFIS model. Final prediction is obtained by the summation of outputs of all ELANFIS sub models. The performance of proposed the technique is tested for the prediction Baishuihe and Shiliushubao landslides. The results show that ELANFIS with EMD model outperforms other methods in terms of generalization performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Empirical mode decomposition; Extreme learning machines (ELM); Landslide displacement; Neuro-fuzzy systems,Adaptive control systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Knowledge acquisition; Landslides; Learning systems; Rain; Signal processing; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Environmental hazards; Extreme learning machine; Generalization performance; Intrinsic Mode functions; Neurofuzzy system; Shiliushubao Landslide; Fuzzy inference,"KV, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology RoorkeeIndia; email: shihab4806@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

Speech specific information is derived in the form of source-filter features. Source features are obtained using multi pitch information. Filter information is estimated using formant analysis. To track multi pitch information in the mixed signal we apply simple-inverse filtering tracking (SIFT) and histogram based pitch estimation to excitation source information. Formant estimation is done using linear predictive (LP) analysis.

These artifacts sturdily affect the investigation and therefore, diagnosis of neural diseases from EEG signal. The artifact removal may cause loss of important information from the signal. Therefore, it is required to remove the motion artifacts and simultaneously preserve the desired information, which makes EEG artifact removal a vital task. Enhanced Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is the most widespread method used for artifact removal, as it is a data-driven based feature extraction method. In this research work the efficiency of various EEMD with different interpolation based artifact removal method have been compared. The EEMD is used to convert input single channel EEG signal to a multichannel signal, and in order to remove the randomness of motion artifact, CCA and DWT filtering were used successively.

Power electronics plays a crucial role in modern power system which makes system operation efficient but it also bring stationary disturbances in the power system and added impurities to the supply. It happens because of the non-linear loads used in modern day power system which inject disturbances like harmonic disturbances, flickers, sag etc. in power grid. These impurities can damage equipments so it is necessary to mitigate these impurities present in the supply very quickly. So, digital signal processing techniques are incorporated for detection purpose. Signal processing techniques like fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, Wavelet transform etc. are widely used for the detection of disturbances. Among all, wavelet transform is widely used because of its better detection capabilities. But, which mother wavelet has to use for detection is still a mystery. Depending upon the periodicity, the disturbances are classified as stationary and non-stationary disturbances. This paper presents the importance of selection of mother wavelet for analyzing stationary disturbances using discrete wavelet transform. Signals with stationary disturbances of various frequencies are generated using MATLAB. The analysis of these signals is done using various mother wavelets like Daubechies and bi-orthogonal wavelets and the measured root mean square value of stationary disturbance is obtained. The measured value obtained by discrete wavelet transform is compared with the exact RMS value of the frequency component and the percentage differences are presented which helps to select optimum mother wavelet. © 2017, The Institution of Engineers (India).",Discrete wavelet transform; Power system disturbances; Stationary disturbances,Digital signal processing; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric power transmission networks; Fast Fourier transforms; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Digital signal processing techniques; Frequency components; Harmonic disturbances; Power system disturbances; Root mean square values; Short time Fourier transforms; Signal processing technique; Stationary disturbances; Wavelet transforms,"Kamble, S.P.; Department of Electrical Engineering, S B Jain Institute of Technology, Management and ResearchIndia; email: saurabh2612k@yahoo.com",,Springer India,22502106,,,,English,J.

The statistical indices applied are capable to flag specific data and thus the timely detection of events. Further, statistical features extracted from event-related segment suggest that the transient signals from different regions are distinct and thus can be classified.

In video steganography, the secret information is concealed in a video file. An MP4 video steganography method that hides audio and image data in wavelet domain is proposed in this paper. A video file consists of I-frame, P-frame, and B-frame. An Iframe, or intra frame, is decoded independently without referencing other frames. P-frames and B-frames are responsible for capturing the motion. A number of I-, P- and B- frames together is called Group of Pictures or GOP. A GOP starts with an I-frame whose length (number of frames between two I- frames, excluding the second I-frame) varies depending on the codec used. Since I-frames are not lost during compression or any kind of signal processing operations, they are selected for embedding. Appropriate pixels of the I-frames and the audio frames are used for embedding without affecting the perceptual features of the video. Redundant copies of the secret information are made to avoid frame loss. The image frames hide the secret images and the audio frames hide the secret audio signals. The secret image and audio signals are transformed using integer wavelet transform and the low frequency coefficients are hidden. The performance is analyzed and the effect of common attacks is discussed. © 2017 IEEE.",GOP; I-frame; MP4; Video steganography; Wavelet,Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Group of pictures; I-frame; Integer wavelet transforms; Perceptual feature; Secret communications; Secret information; Video steganography; Wavelet; Steganography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Therefore the work presented in this paper proposes an alternate method for improving the F0 parameter estimation from distant speech (DS) signals which are collected through microphones at various distances. The proposed method achieves improved F0 estimation by adding a post processing module for the conventional zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method used for F0 estimation. The conventional ZFF method estimates the F0 parameters by estimating the impulse like discontinuities at the glottal closure instants (GCIs). Since strength of the impulses are heavily attenuated in the case DS signals by reducing the impulse strengths at the GCIs, the F0 estimation from the these signals becomes unreliable and inaccurate. Hence the present work proposes an alternate method for enhancing the impulse strength for DS signals by subjecting the one more level of zero frequency filtering to the conventional zero frequency filtered signal at every fixed windows having 25 ms length. The smoothed zero frequency filtered signal windows are further refined by low pass filtering using locally estimated F0 as cut off frequency. The effectiveness of the proposed method of F0 estimation using refined ZFF method is confirmed based on the comparative performance analysis with the other existing zero frequency post filtering approaches on the state of the art SPEECON database. The performance of the proposed method are evaluated based on the Gross error rates obtained by comparing the estimated F0 values computed from the DS signals and with that of the ground truth close speaking speech signals. © 2017 IEEE.",Distant Speech Signal; Fundamental Frequency; Zero Frequency Filter (ZFF),Continuous speech recognition; Frequency estimation; Low pass filters; Signal processing; Speech; Speech communication; Comparative performance analysis; Fundamental frequencies; Low-pass filtering; Robust pitch estimations; Signal attenuation; Speech signals; Zero frequency filters; Zero-frequency filtering; Parameter estimation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is noticed that, if this event sustained for long time it will cause several brain and heart disorders. Diagnoses of such disorders require identification of apnea event. Recently, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals show proficiency for assessing the sleep quality and detection of apnea event. In this work, amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) components based features extracted from EEG signals, are using for identification of sleep apnea event. Teager energy operator (TEO) is uses for separation of AM-FM components but it requires band limited signals. The nature of EEG is highly non-stationary, so an adaptive empirical mode decomposition technique is applied, which convert the nonstationary EEG signals into band limited intrinsic mode functions (IMF). TEO separates each IMF into AM-FM components. The extracted features from separated components are applied as input to least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier and obtained better performance parameters for identification of apnea event compared to existing methods. © 2017 IEEE.",And least square support vector machine; Electroencephalogram signal; Empirical mode decomposition; Teager energy operator,Amplitude modulation; Electroencephalography; Frequency modulation; Least squares approximations; Machine components; Separation; Signal processing; Sleep research; Support vector machines; Electroencephalogram signals; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Frequency modulated; Intrinsic Mode functions; Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM); Least square support vector machines; Performance parameters; Teager energy operators; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Furthermore, we are, to our knowledge, the first to implement and evaluate a multi-tag system. The key technique used by FreeRider is codeword translation, where a tag can transform a codeword present in the original excitation signal into another valid codeword from the same codebook during backscattering. In other words, the backscattered signal is still a valid WiFi, ZigBee, or Bluetooth signal. Therefore, commodity radios decode the backscattered signal and extract the tag's embedded information. More importantly, FreeRider does codeword translation regardless of the data transmitted by these radios. Therefore, these radios can still do productive data communication. FreeRider accomplishes codeword translation by modifying one or more of the three dimensions of a wireless signal - amplitude, phase and frequency. A tag ensures that the modified signal is still comprised of valid codewords that come the same codebook as the original excitation signal.

We estimate the graph Laplacian matrix in an optimization framework that minimizes errors in relations known to exist between the graph signals and their Fourier transforms.

In order to produce realistic outputs, the proposed approach takes advantage of the recent advances in deep learning and generative networks. To achieve plausible colorization, the paper investigates conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) [3] as a solution to this problem. Additionally, a loss function consisting of two classification loss components apart from the adversarial loss learned by the WGAN is proposed. The first classification loss provides a measure of how much the predicted colored images differ from ground truth.

Emotion recognition from audio is an attractive option due to its non-obtrusive nature and availability of microphones in devices at the workplace. We describe building a classifier that analyzes the para-linguistic features of audio streams to classify them into positive, neutral and negative affect. Since speech at the workplace is different from acted speech, and because it is important that the training data be situated in the right context, we designed and executed an emotion induction procedure to generate a corpus of non-acted speech data of 33 speakers. The corpus was used to train a set of classification models and a comparative analysis of these models was used to choose the feature parameters. Bootstrap aggregation (bagging) was then used on the best combination of algorithm (Random Forest) and features (60 millisecond window size). The resulting classification accuracy of 73% is on par with, or exceeds, accuracies reported in the current literature for non-acted speech for a speaker-dependent test set. For reference, we also report the speaker-dependent recognition accuracy (95%) of the same classifier trained and tested on acted speech for three emotions in the Emo-DB database. © 2017 IEEE.",,Decision trees; Linguistics; Multimedia signal processing; Signal processing; Speech; Speech recognition; Statistical methods; Classification accuracy; Classification models; Comparative analysis; Emotion classification; Emotion recognition; Empirical evaluations; Linguistic features; Recognition accuracy; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Difference of this energy corresponding to both the regions is used as the external energy of the proposed ACM. The contour stops and converges completely when this difference attains a maximum value. The proposed approach requires only initial contour selection and no object point selection like the other variants of parametric ACM used for texture segmentation.

Preprocessing techniques such as noise removal, artifacts and background suppression and contrast enhancement are performed before features extraction stage.

Literature suggests strong evidences of stable pattern of EEG associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. But the understanding of the subtle variations between various co-morbidities and the pathophysiology behind it needs appropriate signal processing routines. Hence, this work focuses on the identification of electrophysiological biomarkers from the acquired EEG signals of low-functioning autistic children to distinguish between the various co-morbidities of autism. Results show that the sub band power and coherence parameters estimated from segmented resting state EEG waveforms are capable of differentiating the various subgroups under consideration.

We propose two low complexity mmWave system designs based on the quality of available channel state information (CSI). We first propose the design of transceivers and a two- way AF relay, by minimizing sum-mean square error (SMSE) under the constraint of total relay transmit power while assuming the perfect channel knowledge. We later extend it to a robust design under the assumption that the transceivers posses only imperfect information about the channel state, where the CSI error is assumed to follow the Gaussian distribution. In both the designs, reduced hardware complexity (introduced due to large number of antenna elements in mmWave system) is achieved by analog-digital hybrid processing by using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based sparse signal processing. We present numerical results on the performance of both the designs over various dictionaries. The comparison results show that robust design is resilient to the presence of CSI errors. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the convergence of both the proposed algorithms to a limit even though global convergence is hard to prove due to non convex nature of overall optimization problem. © 2017 IEEE.",,Communication channels (information theory); Errors; Mean square error; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Optimization; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Transceivers; Imperfect information; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Millimeter-wave communication; Multi input multi output; Optimization problems; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Perfect channel knowledge; Sparse signal processing; Channel state information,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15502252,9.78151E+12,IVTCD,,English,IEEE Veh Technol Conf,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040594340

However, with proper placement of the transmit and receive antennas, the channel matrix can be made full/high rank. While optimum placements for full rank can be realized with uniform linear arrays (ULA), this may not be the case with uniform circular arrays (UCA). This motivates the need to investigate efficient signaling schemes for LOS MIMO schemes for different array configurations. Accordingly, in this work, we study various signaling schemes including spatial multiplexing (SMP), spatial modulation (SM), and generalized spatial modulation (GSM) in the context of both ULA and UCA. Our analytical and simulation results show that GSM achieves better performance compared to SMP and SM. We also propose a new signaling scheme, termed as subarray index modulation (SAIM) scheme, where groups of antennas in the array (subarrays) are indexed to convey information bits and each antenna within an activated subarray carries an independent modulation symbol. It is found that the proposed SAIM scheme can achieve better performance compared to SMP, SM, and GSM schemes. © 2017 IEEE.",Circular array; Linear array; LOS MIMO; MmWave communications; Spatial modulation; Subarray index modulation,Antennas; Matrix algebra; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Receiving antennas; Signal processing; Signaling; Circular arrays; Index modulation; Linear arrays; Mm-wave Communications; Spatial modulations; Modulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15502252,9.78151E+12,IVTCD,,English,IEEE Veh Technol Conf,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040593314

We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session.

The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) decomposes raw VAG signal individual characteristic scales known as intrinsic mode function (IMF). The analytical signal representation of IMFs is attained by implementing Hilbert transform on IMFs. In the z-plane, the fundamental analytic IMFs are plotted which are circular in geometry. Area of these circular curves in the z-plane are computed using the central tendency measure (CTM) and chosen as feature in differentiating between healthy and unhealthy VAG signals.

Sparse Representation (SR) is a powerful signal processing theory used in wide variety of applications like image denoising, compression and fusion. Construction of a proper dictionary with reduced computational efficiency is a major challenge in these applications. Owing to the above criterion, we propose a supervised dictionary learning approach for the fusion algorithm. Initially, gradient information is obtained for each patch of the training data set. Then, the edge strength and information content are measured for the gradient patches. A selection rule is finally employed to select the patches with better focus features for training the over complete dictionary. By the above process, the number of input patches for dictionary training is reduced to a greater extent. At the fusion step, the globally learned dictionary is used to represent the given set of source image patches. Experimental results with various source image pairs demonstrate that the proposed fusion framework gives better visual quality and competes with the existing methodologies quantitatively. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Image fusion; K-SVD; OMP; Sparse representation; Supervised dictionary learning,Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Data fusion; Image denoising; Signal processing; Dictionary learning; Dictionary trainings; Gradient informations; Information contents; Learned dictionaries; Over-complete dictionaries; Signal processing theory; Sparse representation; Image fusion,"Aishwarya, N.; R.

Existing blind super-resolution (SR) techniques that account for motion blur are restricted to fronto-parallel planar scenes. We initially develop an SR motion blur model to explain the image formation process in 3D scenes. We then use this model to solve for the three unknowns - the camera trajectories, the depth map of the scene, and the latent HR image. We first compute the global HR camera motion corresponding to each LR observation from patches lying on a reference depth layer in the input images. Using the estimated trajectories, we compute the latent HR image and the underlying depth map iteratively using an alternating minimization framework. Experiments on synthetic and real data reveal that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques by a significant margin. © 1992-2012 IEEE.",depth map; Non-uniform blur; super-resolution,Cameras; Image processing; Image resolution; Iterative methods; Optical resolving power; Signal processing; Depth Map; Kernel; Non-uniform; Signal processing algorithms; Signal resolution; Solid model; Super resolution; Three-dimensional display; Three dimensional computer graphics,"Punnappurath, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT MadrasIndia; email: jithuthatswho@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10577149,,IIPRE,,English,IEEE Trans Image Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023167883

Interconnected 2-area power systems with and without doubly fed induction generator wind turbines are considered for implementing the proposed optimal control methodology. Here, a heuristic gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and its variants such as opposition learningbased GSA (OGSA), disruption-based GSA (DGSA), and disruption based oppositional GSA (DOGSA) are employed to optimize the switching vector and feedback gains of SMC. In order to overcome the inherent chattering problem in SMC, the control signals are considered in the objective function. The robustness of optimized SMC is analyzed by the inclusion of nonlinearities such as generation rate constraint (GRC), governor deadband, and time delay during the signal processing between the control areas, which are present in the real-time power system. The insensitiveness of the optimal controller is shown by variation in system parameters like loading condition, speed governor constant, turbine constant, and tie-line power coefficient. Further, the optimal SMC has been studied with significant load variations and wind power penetration levels in the control areas. The potential of proposed SMC design with chattering reduction feature is shown and validated by comparing the results obtained with the other reported methods in the literature.

Multipliers are the most area and power consuming elements; therefore, it is desirable to realize a filter with minimum number of multipliers. In this paper, design of comb filters based on lattice wave digital filters (LWDF) structure is proposed to minimize the number of multipliers. The fundamental processing unit employed in LWDF requires only one multiplier. These lattice wave digital comb filters (LWDCFs) are realized using Richards' and transformed first-order and second-order all-pass sections. The resulting structural realizations of LWDCFs exhibit properties such as low coefficient sensitivity, high dynamic range, high overflow level, and low round-off noise. Multiplier coefficients of the proposed structures are implemented with canonic signed digit code (CSDC) technique using shift and add operations leading to multiplierless implementation. This contributes in reduction of number of addition levels which reduces the latency of the critical loop. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform is used for evaluation and testing of the proposed LWDCFs to acquire advantages of the parallelism, low cost, and low power consumption. The implementation of the proposed LWDCFs is accomplished on Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 FPGA devices. By means of examples, it is shown that the implementations of the proposed LWDCFs attain high maximum sampling frequency, reduced hardware, and low power dissipation compared with the existing comb filter structures.

Fourier transform is very popular for frequency domain analysis, and the computations are performed in the complex domain. Mapped real transform (MRT), whose basis functions are rectangular in nature, was evolved by modification of discrete Fourier transform and involves real additions only. But it is expansive and redundant. Unique MRT was developed to remove the redundancies present in MRT. Visual representation of unique MRT coefficients was explored to establish a transform, according to sequency, entitled sequency-based MRT (SMRT). It is a sequency ordered, addition oriented, integer-to-integer transform, whose basis functions are orthogonal. This paper gives an insight into the visual representation, transform kernel and placement of the N2 unique MRT coefficients corresponding to an N× N data, for N a power of 2. Different properties of SMRT, computation of statistical parameters from transform coefficients are also included.

The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3%), skin cancer (36.3%), prostate cancer (18.1%), and multi-type cancer (9%). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system.

It developed a summary of the multi-document using the semantic relationship between the input documents rather than what we get exactly from the input document. It is very necessary because of the difficulty of generating abstract manually and also a challenging task. In our system, summary is generated based on the predicate argument structure of the sentences. Semantic role labeling is utilized to obtain the predicate argument structure. Main steps involved in the proposed system: Predicate argument structure of the sentences is extracted to represent text semantically as the first step. Next, it group semantically similar predicate argument structure using hybrid approach of K-mean and agglomerative hierarchical clustering by utilizing semantic similarity measures. K-mean is selected due to its run time efficiency and agglomerative hierarchical clustering is selected due to its quality.

The cost of managing data center includes not only hardware, software costs but also the electricity costs prevailing at that location. The cost of electricity varies from location to location and it is mainly because of the uneven production & availability of resources, infrastructure to generate electricity at that part of the globe. It is important for data center owners to reduce the data center management cost without affecting the agreed SLA of service to its users. The paper proposes an algorithm for routing service requests to geo-distributed datacenters considering the electricity cost and response times to optimize the cost of datacenter management.

The advantages of simple hysteresis controller, viz. simple implementation and fast dynamic response are added with the advantages of constant switching frequency and reduction in Te(p-p) in the proposed controller. Elimination of look up tables is possible since boundary computation is performed online with estimated stator voltages calculated using current errors along the orthogonal axes thus making implementation easier. The voltage vector to be switched in the next sampling interval is identified by the boundary computed in the present sampling interval. The vector selection logic is designed to extract the features of VC-SVPWM based VSI fed IM drive whereby reduced Te(p-p) at higher modulation indices are obtained. A comparative simulation study of the Current Error Space Vector based controller resembling the characteristics of conventional VC-SVPWM based drive with the proposed controller based drive has been conducted using SIMULINK toolbox of MATLAB for steady state as well as transient performance analysis.

But detection of licensed users is often compromised due to issues such as multipath fading, shadowing, and receiver uncertainty. So to deal with these issues, Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) has been proposed. There are two classes in CSS: centralized and decentralized or distributed. In this paper, we compare a fully distributed CSS technique using Consensus Algorithms with the existing OR fusion rule based CSS scheme under AWGN, Rayleigh and correlated log-normal shadowing environments. We also compare existing OR rule with a distributed coalition sensing scheme and study the effect of error in reporting channel. Simulation results show that distributed consensus scheme outperforms OR fusion rule, thus showing the importance of distributed schemes. But in the case of distributed coalition sensing and OR fusion rule, both show somewhat same performance. We found that, with increasing probability of error in reporting channel, the probability of false alarm increases drastically showing a degradation in detection performance. © 2017 IEEE.",coalition formation; Collaborative spectrum sensing; distributed consensus algorithm; reporting channel error,Distributed computer systems; Errors; Fading (radio); Food products; Radio systems; Signal processing; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Coalition formations; Collaborative spectrum sensing; Destructive interference; Distributed consensus; Probability of errors; Probability of false alarm; Reporting channels; Cognitive radio,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

First, monocular video taken using a stationary camera is given as the input to Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based foreground detector. Then a grid is used to measure the number of foreground pixels. If the pixels inside the grid is greater than a pre-assigned threshold, the grid will sense the presence of a vehicle. When the presence of a vehicle is identified within a frame, the region within the bounding box (created by foreground detector), which contain the RGB image of the vehicle is cropped and saved. SURF features of the stored frames are extracted and used for training classifier for 5 vehicle classes, namely, two wheelers, three wheelers, cars, Heavy Motor Vehicle (HMV) and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV). For classifying a test video, frames with vehicles are extracted using the grid and SURF features are extracted and applied to the classifier. When the feature of test vehicle image becomes closer to that of class, the vehicle will be categorized into that class.

It is primarily an infection of lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body such as brain, intestine, kidney and spine. TB remains one of the leading cause of death in developing countries, although most are preventable if diagnosed early and treated. Among the available tools, Sputum smear microscopy is the most widely used one for TB detection. It is done manually and is often time consuming; a laboratory technician is expected to spend at least 25 minutes per slide, limiting the number of slides that can be screened. Also any incorrect diagnosis will leads to serious health issues. So a solution is Automatic screening methods. Many attempts have been made to develop automatic approaches to identify TB bacteria from microscopic sputum smear images. In this paper, we present an automatic TB diagnosis technique using morphological features and ellipse fitting. Microscopic images of sputum smear are collected from infected subjects. These images are transformed into HSV color space for a better analysis, which is thresholded using hue range of red pink color. The resultant images will contain TB bacilli along with non-TB objects. In order to identify the TB regions from the non-TB regions, shape features of every identified region is evaluated. Finally a new algorithm that make use of concave contour points as well as ellipse fitting is performed to separate out the overlapping bacilli region and add them to the total count of bacilli. © 2017 IEEE.",Concave point extraction; Contour segmentation; Ellipse fitting; HSV; Polygon approximation; Shape Feature analysis; Tuberculosis(TB); Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN),Bacilli; Bacteria; Color; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Food products; Geometry; Image processing; Contour segmentation; Ellipse fitting; Point extraction; Polygon approximation; Shape features; Tuberculosis(TB); Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN); Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Recently, the BLDC motor becomes most popular in industrial and residential applications due to its low cost, easy control techniques, low maintenance and constant torque. High switching losses are associated with the conventional BLDC motor because of six number of switches hence poor efficiency. FSTPI fed BLDC motor drive has high efficiency due to the low switching losses. The BLDC motor is found non-liner system due the saturation element. Integral part of PI or PID controller is used to reduce steady state error but integral part may saturate if large changes are made in set point which results in unwanted side effect known as windup phenomenon. Windup phenomenon causes large overshoot and settling time in torque-speed characteristic. A tracking anti windup (AWC) PI controller and hysterics current controller has been introduced for effective utilization of proposed system and to make system free from windup phenomenon. FSTPI fed BLDC motor drive system with tracking anti windup PI controller and hysterics current controller is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink software.

As the linear control techniques have a disadvantage of requiring tuning from time-to-time, non-linear control techniques were employed for the control. One such non-linear control technique is feedback linearization control (FBLC). A control strategy for controlling the output voltage of three phase PWM converters through a linearization technique is discussed in this paper. Feedback linearization technique allows a few advantages like the decoupled control of the state variables, wide operating region. The performance analysis of the converter control using FBLC is done for varied conditions of load.

From the traditional methods of pen-and-paper and Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), it has evolved into 'Online Examinations', which are a lot more flexible, time-saving as well as require much fewer resources. However, they have certain drawbacks too. While the uncertainties involved in the working of the electronic equipment and 'server break-down' do affect the examination, the developments in technology have helped overcome these. However, the most important problem faced by online examinations is the authenticity of the student who is taking it.

Sliding mode control is invariably used to address control problems in non-linear systems. The main drawback of sliding mode based approach is chattering. To reduce chattering and to minimize the steady state error an Integral Sliding Mode Controller is proposed. The proposed controller shows better performance when subjected to different operating conditions, such as robustness and insensitivity to parameter variations, power reversal, fault condition, chattering detection etc. All the above simulations are carried out under MATLAB/SIMULINK. © 2017 IEEE.",Input-output linearization; Integral Sliding Mode Controller; Sliding Mode Controller; Voltage source converter-High Voltage Direct Current,Controllers; DC power transmission; Food products; HVDC power transmission; Linear control systems; Linear systems; MATLAB; Signal processing; Different operating conditions; High voltage direct current; Input output linearization; Integral sliding mode; Integral sliding mode control; Non linear control; Sliding mode controller; Steady state errors; Sliding mode control,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Local tetra pattern (LTrP) is used to obtain the feature map from an input image. Decomposition of DWT up to single level and the features obtained from it would make the CBIR system very sensitive to noise. Therefore, decomposition up to three scales is used to remove noise. On each of the sub band LTrP is applied and 130 features are extracted. Further, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed for index matching and image retrieval task which gives the classification accuracy of 97.9 % for Corel 1K database. We have compared our proposed feature extraction scheme with LTrP and other existing local descriptor. Results show that combination of DWT and Local Tetra Patterns (DWT + LTrP) extracts more robust features than LTrP alone. Also, the effect of different wavelet filters on the accuracy of the system has been analyzed. Proposed framework has been tested on Corel-1000 and Corel-10000 databases. We have used average retrieval rate, precision, and recall for performance measure of the CBIR system. Proposed method outperforms the retrieval rate from 75.9% using LTrP to 97.9% using proposed method on Corel 1K database. Improvement in performance measures as compared to the other existing methods evidence that, the proposed spatio-frequency local descriptor is more robust for image retrieval task. © 2017 IEEE.",ANN; Corel database; DWT; Image retrieval; LBP; Local Tetra patterns,Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Database systems; Discrete wavelet transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Food products; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Content-Based Image Retrieval; Different wavelets; Index matching; Local descriptors; Local Tetra patterns; Performance measure; Spatio frequency; Image retrieval,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Comparative analysis has been carried out between two control strategies: PI control and Fuzzy Logic control.

In this approach, certain parts of a graph are grouped together as subgraphs termed as optimized deterministic routing areas (ODRAs). Each ODRA has a unique representative element called optimized proxy. The input graph is reduced by replacing ODRAs with optimized proxies and the new reduced graph is used for the shortest path and distance queries.

This approach chooses the precise wavelet for Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). The motor phase currents are continuously monitored and discrete wavelet analysis is performed to obtain the approximate and detailed coefficients at different levels. The wavelet functions used are db1, db2, db3, db4, sym2 and sym3. Various statistical parameters such as standard deviation, inter quartile range, norm and harmonic mean of approximate and detailed coefficients have been calculated. These parameters are obtained for both healthy and faulty conditions of the motor at various load levels. Simulation results indicate that norm parameter of the detailed coefficients at healthy condition is equal for all three phases. However, during the fault condition, the norm of sixth level detailed coefficients of db1 wavelet corresponding to the faulty phase shows an increment in its value compared to other two healthy phases. This variation is valid for all load conditions. Hence, db1 selected as one of the best wavelets for turn-to-turn fault detection. Also among the statistical parameter, norm is observed as the accurate feature for stator fault detection.

SiC MOSFETs can be operated at higher switching frequencies and higher ambient temperatures than Si MOSFETs. This paper deals with design, fabrication and testing of a gate driver circuit for driving SiC power MOSFETs at switching frequencies up to 1.0 MHz. SiC MOSFETs can be used in very high frequency (HF) and high voltage switched-mode power supplies (SMPS), uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), induction heating, welding power supplies etc. for better performance and efficiency than their silicon counterparts. In this paper, the selection of circuit components for gate drivers for SiC MOSFETs is discussed. A gate driver card is fabricated and is tested by switching a SiC MOSFET feeding a 50 W load at 1.0 MHz switching frequency. The waveforms at the different points of the gate driver circuit and the power circuit are presented. Short circuit protection is implemented through device voltage sensing. The effect of junction capacitance Cjd of the diode, which is used for sensing the device voltage, is studied. A procedure to overcome the drawbacks of the same is discussed and implemented successfully. Also a soft turn-off technique is implemented to turn off the device smoothly in the event of a fault, avoiding ringing and voltage overshoot. © 2017 IEEE.",Desat protection; High frequency converter; High frequency gate driver; SiC gate driver; SiC MOSFETs; Soft turn-off,Capacitance; Energy gap; Fabrication; Food products; Induction heating; Power MOSFET; Semiconducting silicon; Shape memory effect; Signal processing; Silicon; Silicon carbide; Silicon compounds; Switched mode power supplies; Switching; Thermal conductivity; Uninterruptible power systems; Voltage regulators; Wide band gap semiconductors; Desat protection; Gate drivers; High frequency converter; SiC MOSFETs; Turn offs; MOSFET devices,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The pressure signals sensed by these sensors are found to have pulsations due to construction and operation of the engine induced during intake and exhaust stroke. Thus, the frequencies of these pulsations have been correlated to vary with engine speed. As a result, filtering methods using engine speed information directly or indirectly have been currently used in the industry. The study presented in this paper aims at predicting the frequency of the pulsations in the sensed signals by using the periodic property of the pulsations and not from engine speed. Using the estimated frequency, possibility of pulsation filtering without depending on the information of engine speed is the major contribution of this work. © 2017 IEEE.",airpath pressure; frequency estimation; pulsation,Air intakes; Engines; Food products; Information filtering; Internal combustion engines; Signal processing; Speed; Adaptive frequency estimation; Air paths; Electronic controls; Engine operations; Filtering method; Intake and exhaust; Periodic properties; pulsation; Frequency estimation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Business transaction processing systems lack ease of usability and acceptability among those who work on defining transactions for business processes. The major reason behind this is the difficulty in understanding the business processing framework provided by these systems and the adept programming skills required to work on them. Thus new challenges and barriers seem to come up in this area. This work tries to overcome this problem, by introducing a domain specific language called XBRL which brings down the level of programming knowledge required to work on business transaction systems. This can help the the business domain experts in implementing complex business transactions without learning complex programming languages. The XBRL language is developed using Eclipse Framework Xtext and programming language Xtend. This framework gives better efficiency than any general purpose language in terms of complexity of programming. It also provides a set of features like domain specific content-assist, validator and quickfix suggestions. The XBRL language can be easily extended for using in newer domains like big data processing and machine learning, which can enable business transaction processing systems to handle transactions involving huge volumes of data.

With increasing volume and velocity of data handled by these applications, known as the bigdata problem, traditional recommendation systems that analyze data and update models at regular time intervals would not be able to satisfy this requirement. With the evolution of technologies for processing bigdata in real time, it has become fairly easy to implement real time recommendation systems. Stream-computing is a new computing paradigm for handling the velocity attribute of bigdata which makes it possible to develop real time bigdata applications. This paper gives the details of implementation of a real time recommendation system using Apache Spark, a widely used platform for stream computing. This system is implemented for recommending TV channels to viewers in real time. This becomes a challenging task due to continuous changes in the set of available channels and the context dependent preference of viewers. In channel recommendation scenario, characterized by its dynamic nature, volume of data, and tight time constraints, traditional approaches cannot be used. We have implemented a highly scalable TV channel recommendation system optimized for the processing of real-time data streams originating from set-top boxes. The proposed system implements a self-adaptive approach for model building. The system effectively uses distributed processing power of Apache Spark to make recommendations in real time with scalability to meet the real time constraints with increasing load. The Spark Machine Learning Libraries (Spark MLLib) provide several algorithms which were used for developing the proposed recommendation system.

Selection of high-performance diodes for such high-frequency rectification is challenging as a trade-off is often required among numerous conflicting parameters. Three high performance diodes, namely, an ultra-fast silicon diode, a super barrier diode and a silicon carbide Schottky diode, are compared experimentally for their relative performances for high frequency rectification. The experimental cases include rectification of sinusoidal, square and quasi-square wave alternating waveforms as these are commonly encountered in compact power supplies. At first, the diodes are compared for their forward voltage drops and their reverse recovery times with low-amplitude, high-frequency alternating waveforms generated using a waveform generator. Later the diodes are tested with sinusoidal excitation of much higher amplitude, generated using a power amplifier and the above said waveform generator. It is seen that the results of the comparative study at lower amplitude hold good at higher amplitude as well. A unique experimental condition is applied for enhancing and estimating the case-to-ambient thermal resistance of the diode under study. Later, from the practically obtained thermal resistance and the measured temperature rise of each of the diode, the power loss incurred in each diode is obtained.

DR is very effective when measurement is free from gross error. Data observed from chemical processes can be serially correlated. Serial correlation in data can arise when a process, takes time to adjust, is exposed to prolonged influences, when data is manipulated or smoothened. If serial correlation is not taken care of, then gross error detection may be inaccurate. Hence dealing serial correlation is important in gross error detection (GED) techniques. Most of the techniques implemented in gross error detection require no correlation in the measurement. But experimental data may have serial correlation. In this paper, various approaches like variance correction and pre-whitening are implemented to deal serial correlation on ARMA process and measurement test (MT) is applied to detect gross error. Results portray that MT is not an efficient method for GED and amongst the above mentioned two methods, pre-whitening with low variance is better than variance correction method. © 2017 IEEE.",ARMA; GED; measurement test; Serial Correlation,Error detection; Errors; Food products; ARMA; Chemical process; Correlated data; Data validation; Gross error detection; Process information; Serial correlation; Variance corrections; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Electric Field Mills (EFMs) are electromechanical devices used to observe static atmospheric electric fields during fair weather and during storm conditions. EFM readings show significant changes in electric field due to an approaching thunderstorm and particularly, during lightning periods. Attempts to comprehend the variations prior to and after a strike has been done by observatories all over the world. This paper focuses on identifying characteristic changes in atmospheric electric field prior to a lightning strike. Both static and dynamic field changes are studied by means of literature survey and static field variations are also studied through analysis of EFM data from Sonnblick Observatory, Austria and National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS), Trivandrum, Kerala. During thunderstorms and the few seconds prior to lightning, significant changes are observed in both static and dynamic electric fields. Static field changes include a magnitude rise and reversal of direction of electric field from the fair weather situation, and dynamic field changes are characterized by the occurrence of Preliminary Breakdown Pulses(PBP) which is the dynamic electrical activity inside the cloud before a strike. This study, by identifying the characteristic changes in atmospheric electric field prior to lightning strike by comparing multiple observations from different parts of the world, points to great possibilities in the field of lightning prediction. © 2017 IEEE.",Atmospheric electric field; EarlyWaming; EFM; lightning; Preliminary Breakdown Pulse,Electromechanical devices; Food products; Lightning; Observatories; Signal processing; Thunderstorms; Atmospheric electric field; Dynamic electric fields; EarlyWaming; Electric field mill; Electrical activities; Lightning strikes; Literature survey; Preliminary Breakdown Pulse; Electric fields,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Even though radiographs are mostly used for the primary screening of bone tumors, it is very difficult to detect the early stages of lesions as there are only slight variations in the gray level intensity between normal and abnormal regions. The primary objective of this investigation is to compare the performance of various texture features computed from radiographs of bone tumors to identify features which correlate with bone destruction in tumors. Texture features using first-order statistics, second-order gray level statistics and fractal dimension were tested on different normal and abnormal regions of two x-ray images of bone, one affected by bone tumor non-ossifying fibroma (benign) and other with osteosarcoma (mafignant). First order statistical measures were also tested on a data set of radiographic images of benign lesions.

Then, from each set of decomposed IMFs, higher order statistical moments have been extracted to serve as input features to the classifier. Statistical analysis of the selected features have been done using ANOVA test Finally, using a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, classification of different power system transient disturbances are done based on the selected feature sets with high discriminative capability.

Generally, many of the change detection techniques involve a pixel to pixel comparison by using an algebraic or a transform method of change detection. This technique profoundly depends on the optimum choice of threshold value to separate the real altered pixels. Moreover all these techniques are capable of calculating only the two dimensionality change in the environment, whereas in the proposed technique a differential geometry approach is used to detect changes from images which are done by involving the geometric property of the pixels with respect to its environment.

Subsequently, the pupil is segmented from the smoothened iris images, using wavelet transform.

Recently, numerous HIL systems are in practice for simulating the vehicle networks in real time, by providing necessary signals based on the test cases. There are many approaches to tap the signal from the instrument cluster before it gets displayed, and based on the test case the signal that is captured will be compared with the expected value. The current approaches deal only at the software level and fails in identifying the faults in the end display unit of cluster. The proposed method uses vision based machine learning system to monitor the cluster visually thereby identifying faults in cluster at the end product level. This approach greatly eases the task of testing for more number of units by making onerous repeated test without any human intervention, as the current testing method needs human approval for each and every test case which is tedious task to do. © 2017 IEEE.",Automated testing for Instrument cluster; Hardware-in-the-loop; Machine Learning; Machine Vision,Artificial intelligence; Automobile instruments; Computer vision; Hardware; Instrument testing; Real time systems; Signal processing; Synthetic apertures; Current testing; Effective approaches; Expected values; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Hardware in the loops; Human intervention; Instrument clusters; Machine learning techniques; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type which satisfies these requirements. But the two main performance parameters of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are near to the ground for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of a patch antenna is 1-2dB. Most straightforward approach of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to generation of surface waves. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. In this paper pentagon shaped patch antenna with metamaterial on the substrate for multiband application is proposed. The analysis is done using Ansoft HFSS software version 15.0. The performance parameters analysed are bandwidth, gain and return loss.

This has lead to a steady shift towards using Open Software Defined Networks to reduce operational expenditure. The whole of the intelligence lies in the central controller which obviously is the single point of failure. The attackers find it easy to bring down the whole network by saturating the control plane of the SDN which eventually leads to denial-of-service (DoS) to the data plane, through host location hijacking attack. The various strategies proposed to defend the SDN controller from host location hijack attack includes authentication of host which incurs overhead. In this paper we propose SLAMHHA, a Supervised Learning Approach to Mitigate Host location Hijacking Attack. SLAMHHA is implemented in the SDN controller which monitors the legitimacy of the hosts and identifies the clandestine users impersonating the hosts in the data plane. The SLAMHHA algorithm can be implemented in either of the two SDN controller setup (i.e.) in both centralized and decentralized controller setup, been used to set the flow rules and monitor the underlying network. MININET has been used to test the efficiency of the SLAMHHA algorithm. SLAMHHA algorithm was implemented in the POX controller. Numerical results show that SLAMHHA incurs less overhead in terms of CPU and memory consumption when compared to the authentication method. This algorithm blocks the attack within 3 seconds when 100 hosts are impersonated to perform DoS attack. Thus our proposed SLAMHHA algorithm mitigates the host location hijacking attack with less overhead. © 2017 IEEE.",denial-of-service; Host Location Hijacking Attack; Software Defined Networks; supervised learning,Authentication; Controllers; Decentralized control; Location; Numerical methods; Signal processing; Software defined networking; Supervised learning; Telecommunication traffic; Authentication methods; Decentralized controller; Denial of Service; Host location; Intelligent components; Operational expenditures; Supervised learning approaches; Underlying networks; Denial-of-service attack,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The correlation of ventricle area with ground truth is high (R = 0.99). It is noticed that SZ subjects have increased ventricle area compared to that of normal subjects. The high value of rand index (0.98) along with low value of global consistency error and variation of information shows the efficiency of the proposed method. The feature area extracted from the ventricle seems to be significant; hence it may be clinically supportive in the diagnosis of Schizophrenic subjects. © 2017 IEEE.",bias correction; multiplicative intrinsic component optimization; Schizophrenia; segmentation,Brain; Brain mapping; Diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal processing; Bias correction; Biomedical research; Energy minimization; Global consistency; Neurological disorders; Optimization method; Schizophrenia; Variation of informations; Image segmentation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In recent years, plant species recognition is carried out based on the shape, geometry and texture of various plant parts such as leaves, stem, flowers etc. Flower based plant species identification systems are widely used. While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy. Images of the plant species are acquired using the built-in camera module of a mobile phone. Feature extraction of flower images is performed using a Transfer Learning approach (i.e. extraction of complex features from a pre-trained network). A machine learning classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest is used on top of it to yield a higher accuracy rate. This approach helps in minimizing the hardware requirement needed to perform the computationally intensive task of training a CNN. It is observed that, CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach as feature extractor outperforms all the handcrafted feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Color Channel Statistics, Color Histograms, Haralick Texture, Hu Moments and Zernike Moments. CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach yields impressive Rank-1 accuracies of 73.05%, 93.41% and 90.60% using OverFeat, Inception-v3 and Xception architectures, respectively as Feature Extractors on FLOWERS102 dataset. © 2017 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Flower Recognition; Transfer Learning,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Convolution; Decision trees; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Signal processing; Tellurium compounds; Automatic identification; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction methods; Flower recognition; Plant species identification; Species recognition systems; Transfer learning; Search engines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The aim of this paper is to design and synthesize a Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) using a reversible decoder which is designed using reversible logic with minimum quantum cost. The PROM is a Programmable Logic device which consists of fixed AND Gates and programmable OR gates array. Fixed AND gates can be termed as a decoder. PROM finds its applications in cell phones, RFID tags, video game consoles, medical devices, computers and other electronic devices. An n input and k output Boolean function f (a1, a2, a3,....an) (referred as (n, k)) is said to be logically reversible if and only if, the number of inputs are equal to the number of outputs i.e., 'n' equals 'k' and the input pattern uniquely maps the output pattern. The reversible logic must run both forward and backward as well such that the inputs can also be retrieved from outputs. There are many reversible logic gates in literature like NOT gate, Feynman Gate (CNOT gate), Double Feynman Gate, Peres Gate, TR gate, Seynman Gate and many more. Fan-out and Feed-back are not allowed in Logical Reversibility. To overcome the Fan out limitation, the signals from required output lines are duplicated to desired lines using additional reversible combinational circuits. Reversible Logic owns its applications in various fields which include Quantum Computing, Optical Computing, Nano-technology, Computer Graphics, low power VLSI etc., Reversible logic is gaining its own importance in recent years largely due to its property of low power consumption and low heat dissipation. In this paper, the Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) using reversible decoder which has less heat dissipation and low power consumption is proposed. The designed circuit is analyzed in terms of quantum cost, garbage outputs and number of gates.

Over the years, researchers analysed many relaxation techniques by which stress levels could be reduced. In this work, an attempt has been made to analyse the effect of one of the relaxation stimuli (Alpha music) in the mental task performance. The participants are identified as Normal or Stressed based on the Stress scores in Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS). The Stroop task is provided to the participants and the reaction times for congruent and incongruent stimuli were calculated. The task performance measures such as Omission and Commission errors in the mental task were analysed, before and after providing Alpha music. Fourteen participants were identified as normal participants and fourteen participants were identified as stressed participants using DASS. The reaction time was found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) for incongruent stimuli than for the congruent stimuli for both group of participants. The Omission and Commission errors significantly reduced (p<0.05) after the provision of relaxation stimuli. This finding suggests that under the influence of alpha music, reduction in the feelings of stress and increased sense of relaxation is observed. © 2017 IEEE.",Alpha music; Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS); Depression; Mathematical task; Stroop task; Task performance measures,Electrical engineering; Alpha music; Depression; Mathematical task; Stress scale; Stroop task; Task performance; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

However, in CRN channel characteristics varies widely due to the random arrival of PUs which leads to call dropping/call blocking. Excessive call dropping reduces the quality of VoIP communication for SU's. Quality of Service (QoS) can be improved by exclusive channel reservation for SUs which involves policy formation and cost implication. To avoid the complexity, we have used sub-banding concept for Call Admission Control (CAC) scheme and utilized the scheme for VoIP applications using Adaptive Codec Switching Policy. Test bed analysis is performed to evaluate the behavior of some well known high/low bit rate codecs in CRN. Overall system performance is evaluated by using two dimensional Markov Model.

Sometimes, remote sensing images have dead pixels or pixel missing gives poor visual quality. It is mainly due to the presence of clouds, fogs, or shadows since these images are acquired by sensors at different seasons. The other serious problems in remote sensing images are instrumentation error, registration error and losses of image data during transmission. To get a good visual quality images, degraded remote sensing images are processed by using the application of inpainting. The main objectives of this image inpainting approaches are to fill lost parts of images, delete unwanted objects, remove noise in images and to enhance images quality. Image completion or image inpainting process is one in which the damaged portions are reconstructed or to fill the lost regions using data collected from surrounding areas in original image.

The aim of this paper is to design and synthesize a Programmable array Logic (PAL) and Programmable Logic array (PLA) using reversible logic with minimum quantum cost. The PAL is a Programmable Logic device which consists of programmable AND Gates and fixed OR gates array. The PLA is the PLD which contains programmable AND array and programmable OR array. The PLDs are the combinational circuits mainly used to realize Boolean functions on our interest. An n input and k output Boolean function f (a1, a2, a3,.... an) (referred as (n, k)) is said to be logically reversible if and only if, the number of inputs are equal to the number of outputs i.e., 'n' equals 'k' and the input pattern maps uniquely maps the output pattern. The reversible logic must run both forward and backward in such a way that the inputs can also be retrieved from outputs. There are many reversible logic gates in literature like NOT gate, Feynman Gate (CNOT gate), Double Feynman Gate, Peres Gate, TR gate, Seynman Gate and many more. Fan-out and Feed-back are not allowed in Logical Reversibility. To overcome the Fan out limitation, the signals from required output lines are duplicated to desired lines using additional reversible combinational circuits. Reversible Logic owns its applications in various fields which include Quantum Computing, Optical Computing, Nano-technology, Computer Graphics, low power VLSI etc., Reversible logic is gaining its own importance in recent years largely due to its property of low power consumption and low heat dissipation. In this paper, the design of PAL and PLA which has less heat dissipation and low power consumption is proposed. The designed circuits are analyzed in terms of quantum cost, garbage outputs and number of gates.

These sensor nodes are equipped with limited resources such as memory, processing capability, battery power and transceiver for monitoring, processing and communicating the observed phenomena to make critical decisions with respect to collected data. Evaluating the trustworthiness of data is a primary preprocessing process of event detection in WSN. The trustworthy data which is free from data fault, inaccuracy and inconsistency is used to identify the interesting events and critical decision making in WSN. In this paper, we present our current work on data trust model that focuses on data fault detection, data reconstruction, data quality estimation for reliable event detection in WSN. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel data trust model for harsh environment of WSN to identify the events and strange environmental data behavior.

Many anti-jamming schemes available to protect the Cognitive Radio Networks from jamming attack uses frequency hopping techniques which are deterministic in nature. The deterministic frequency hopping technique is vulnerable to attack at some stage in the real-world scenario. The proposed anti-jamming system for cognitive radio network with adaptive frequency hopping technique efficiently thwarts the RF jamming attack. In the presences of a reactive jammer, two techniques are used to achieve the adaptive frequency hopping: (i) when channel availability reduces below 75 % the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm is used, (ii) when the system is in critical state (i.e. channel availability reduces further below 25 %) the interaction between Cognitive radio node and the jammer is modelled using Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). The results obtained from both models are improved further to find most suitable channel. The simulation results show that the anti-jamming system significantly decreases the probability of bit error to about 48% in the presences of reactive jammer. © 2017 IEEE.",Anti-jamming; Cognitive Radio; Evolutionary Game Theory; Hidden Markov Model,Critical current density (superconductivity); Frequency hopping; Game theory; Hidden Markov models; Jamming; Markov processes; Radio; Radio systems; Security systems; Signal processing; Adaptive frequency hopping; Anti-jamming; Anti-jamming capability; Channel availability; Cognitive radio network; Evolutionary game theory; Probability of bit error; Theoretical approach; Cognitive radio,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is primarily used for finding patterns that are validated through statistical methods, in the context of brain connectivity. Quantification of functional connectivity is usually performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Many Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have used PCC to quantify functional connectivity in a bivalent sense. However, the interpretation of negative fMRI responses or deactivation has proved challenging. Therefore, few have employed the absolute value of PCC (univalent) to model functional connectivity. This paper compares the two measures and assesses their performance and suitability for fMRI connectivity modeling. Connectivity analysis and classification of autistic individuals from control population is performed using these two measures. Machine learning classification is employed to quantify the predictive abilities of univalent and bivalent functional connectivity measures. This paper experimentally finds the usage of bivalent measure to be producing better classification accuracy by around 2%, which means it is more suitable for fMRI functional connectivity analysis. © 2017 IEEE.",Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; machine learning; Pearson' scorrelation coefficient,Artificial intelligence; Brain; Correlation methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Stochastic systems; Classification accuracy; Connectivity analysis; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Machine learning classification; Pearson' scorrelation coefficient; Pearson's correlation coefficients; Predictive abilities; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The state of Tamil Nadu in India and Sri Lanka have vast populations of indigenous Tamil speakers. The Thirukkural is a classical Tamil Sangam Literature, penned by the famous Tamil poet, Thiruvalluvar. Kural is a very short Tamil Poetic form consisting of two lines. Thirukkural contains many important messages, speaking about the moral and ethical values to be followed by everyone. Up to now, speech Recognition has not been applied to this literature. This paper proposes a system which will recognize and retrieve the meaning of Thirukkural from speech utterances. This is achieved by extracting the MFCC feature vectors from the input speech (kural) and building the acoustic models by using Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM). This speaker independent system aims to convert the input speech Thirukkural into text and display the meaning in Tamil along with the chapter number, name and kural number. The system will also synthesize the meaning of the Thirukkural(text to speech). This will be useful to students and visually challenged people to learn Thirukkural in an interactive way. This will be a great help in encouraging more people to take an interest in and learn the Thirukkural. Experiments were conducted by collecting the corpus from 25 people (2000 kural samples) for one chapter of Thirukkural named 'Seynandri Aridhal'. The performance of the system was evaluated by building models for different mixture components and retrieving the meaning. It was found to give 100 % accurate results for 128 mixture component models. © 2017 IEEE.",Acoustic Modelling; Feature Extraction; Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM); Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficents(MFCC); Tamil Speech Recognition; Thirukkural Recognition,Feature extraction; Gaussian distribution; Signal processing; Speech; Acoustic modelling; Cepstral; Gaussian Mixture Model; Important messages; Mixture components; Speaker independents; Speech utterance; Thirukkural Recognition; Speech recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Many existing methods are there. Abnormal events are those which cannot be well represented. For example, if a flight is hijacked or it is damaged, it is due to some abnormal activities. Abnormal activities may occur due to human intervention or due to some weather conditions. So in this system we are using abnormal detector to detect the events. Abnormal patterns are extracted from incoming events. The major contribution to this paper are: 1) In this abnormal detector is used to identify abnormal events. In this complexity is high in video events due to the presence of noise. By using mixture of Gaussian interference can be avoided. 2) In this, we are using Gaussian Mixture Model to reduce interference. Even though the method has high complexity. 3) Unusually normal events occur in testing videos which differ from training once this is due to existence of abnormalities. They presented as an online updating strategy is proposed to cover these cases in normal patterns as a result, it mostly eliminates false detections.

The process of computing the FFT for large sequence real time data becomes complex and tedious. Hence it is necessary to design a system that can perform the FFT computation of large sequence data with reduced power consumption. This paper presents the design of low power Radix-8 DIT FFT. The proposed design aims at reducing the number of multipliers that are used to compute the FFT. This is achieved by swapping the input terms and reordering them. This leads to a reduction in the number of multipliers used to perform the computation and thereby causing a reduction in the power consumption. This method is highly advantageous when the input signals are lengthy since the number of multipliers used is large in number consuming very high power. In order to optimize the FFT architecture the number of multipliers is reduced thereby causing a significant reduction in power. The prototype for Radix-2 (8 point) and Radix-4 (16 point) optimized FFT is designed, implemented and simulated using Altera ModelSim DE2 EP2C35F672C6 FPGA device.

It is used to access the stored data in bit cell during read cycle. Sense intensifier enhances the little distinction between bit lines to the full swing level. Its execution influences the get to time and power dissemination of memory and henceforth by lessening the detecting deferral and power utilization of sense speaker the execution of memory makes strides. Since the majority of the memory related operations are perused operations, this causes a vast sparing in the general power scattered by the memory. Additionally as sense intensifiers scatters extensive amount of short out power instead of the dynamic power disseminated by the cell exhibit, substantial power is spared. The requirement for the hearty outline of low power fast CMOS simple VLSI circuits is developing immensely. This development is because of the innovative drive that originates from the decrease of the base component size to downsize the chip zone. Downsizing the transistor size can then coordinate more circuit segments are solitary chip zone and bring down the cost. Likewise littler geometry normally brings down the parasitic capacitances, which implies higher working pace and lower control utilization. For a comparative analysis, we will be cataloguing the different sense amplifiers in use currently, using various nanometer technologies such as 180nm, 90nm and 45nm.

This STTC based cooperative MIMO technique is incorporated into Exclusive OR - Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (XOR-LEACH) protocol. For selection of cluster head, the last cluster head and a arbitrary binary vector are XORed together. The proposed system obtains amended performance and is compared with the existing LEACH protocol in terms of network lifespan and residual energy. This system performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) has been analyzed for various detection techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",cluster head; Cooperative Multiple Input Multiple Output; Exclusive OR - Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy; Network lifetime; Space Time Trellis Code; Wireless Sensor Networks,Bit error rate; Clustering algorithms; Codes (symbols); Convolutional codes; Feedback control; Leaching; Low power electronics; MIMO systems; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Space time codes; Telecommunication links; Telecommunication repeaters; Trellis codes; Cluster head; Cooperative multiple input multiple outputs; Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchies; Network lifetime; Space-time trellis codes; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The blood vessels are visualized by using this system through ultrasonic visualization technique inside and also competent of viewing the diseased vessels and detecting the placement of the vessels also detecting and measuring length of the plaque present. IVUS is a well-organized technique for detecting coronary calcium. However IVUS has a drawback in measuring the calcium thickness, and in identifying the arc of the calcium layer. Thus the occurrence of the deposited plaque and calcium along the walls of coronary vessel is a sign of escemic heart diseases.

The topology is susceptible to node and link failures which lead to network partitioning. Topology reconfiguration aims to recover from the failure and maintain the connectivity. Existing topology reconfiguration algorithms does topology updates at regular intervals which increases the communication overhead and leads to energy depletion. We propose a distributed load balanced Cluster-based Topology Reconfiguration algorithm that achieves higher data delivery and connectivity. In this work we estimate the failure of the nodes and links and reconfigured the topology by selecting optimal transmission power to avoid partitioning. Topology updates are done only at failing conditions.

In the last few decades the world have seen an unprecedented period of technological growth and information access. Unfortunately, along with the technological growth the threats have also increased and the awareness and readiness to deal with them have not kept pace. According to the latest revision of OWASP on July 15, 2016, the top most three web attacks are Injection, Broken authentication and session management, XSS Attacks i.e., Cross-site scripting attacks. Cross-site scripting attacks are a leading online threat. The aim of this attack is to exploit vulnerabilities in the websites which the victim visits. By compromising legitimate websites with malicious content that can capture keystrokes and record user's login information and password. If the login information and password are captured, then the personal data could be compromised. Cross-Site Scripting is the most common attack that allows the attacker to insert a malevolent code in a web page which is then used to affect the visitors of the browser and then the inserted code steals the sensitive information automatically and embezzles the delicate information. In order to prevent the XSS attack, many solutions have been suggested and most of them used are the filters that cleans the malicious input. But many of these filters do not provide prevention to the emerging attacks. Inspired by this attack, the paper proposes and implements an approach based on Extenuating Web Vulnerability with a detection and protection mechanism for a secure web access. This defending mechanism is an effective solution for extenuating web vulnerability for a secure web access. © 2017 IEEE.",Cross-Site Scripting; Malevolent Report; Policy Filters; Web Filters; WS Policy Management; WSP,Authentication; Signal processing; Websites; Cross site scripting; Cross Site Scripting Attacks; Malevolent Report; Protection mechanisms; Sensitive informations; Web application security; Web filters; WS-policy; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Information is not disclosed by any single share except for all shares. Printing the encrypted secret on transparencies and stacking them will reveal the secret. More than one secret is encrypted by the visual sharing of multiple secrets and thus encryption capacity is increased when compared to a single secret. A code book resulting in at least two times of pixel expansion is followed by visual cryptography thus creating a poor contrast level. This proposed visual secret sharing scheme share two color images on rectangular shares with no pixel expansion. The originality of secret is verified by watermark which is embedded into the secret image followed by the sharing process. The secret is reconstructed and watermarks are retrieved from the original secret to perform authenticity.

By manipulating droplets with negligible volumes, the DMFB provides susceptibility with comparatively less human errors than the former routing methods. When two droplets are sharing a same routing path, the second droplet may be contaminated due to the leftovers of the first droplet which affects the assay. To avoid cross contamination 1. A DMFB need to be periodically washed out. 2. Contamination aware routing path need to be calculated. This work attends to utilize both the modified version of the solution. This project work attempts to propose a simultaneous wash out routing algorithm for dynamic parallel droplet testing with reduced timing overhead. A reconfigurable DMFB (Digital Microfluidic Biochip) test bed architecture with N × N pin structure will be designed using HDL. Parallel droplets will be introduced using different input pin channels with addition to that a wash out droplet will also be introduced and kept idle initially. When the destination pins for the actual droplets is configured, shortest path routing prediction will take place in parallel with a multi-objective modified swarm intelligence algorithm which is initiated to predict the routing path of the wash droplet to avoid cross contamination possibilities for the testing droplets. The second routing algorithm is dedicated for wash droplet through which is analyzes the first (droplet) routing result to find possible cross contamination. The modified swarm routing will be gated in case of non-contaminated routing path is already predicted in the first routing which saves the circuit power dissipation. © 2017 IEEE.",Algorithm; DMFB; Dynamic droplet; RDMFB; Wash operation,Algorithms; Biochips; Contamination; Digital microfluidics; Microfluidics; Reconfigurable architectures; Signal processing; Cross contamination; Digital microfluidic biochips; DMFB; P-i-n structure; RDMFB; Routing methods; Shortest path routing; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Drops,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The wide scale applications of perceptual hash in the world of multimedia, such as video authentication, video copyright protection, and video retrieval, emphasize the importance of this area of research. This work generates a perceptual hash from the video using the 3D-radial projection of the pixels and assesses the differentiating capabilities and the perceptual robustness of the hash generated. This method is the 3D extension of the 2D radial projection based image hashing. In this work, the variance of the luminance values of the projected pixels is calculated for each randomly generated sub-tensor. The variance of all the sub-tensors are averaged along the second dimension and projected onto the discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis.

Most communication and signal processing techniques rely on the fact that channel noise is Gaussian distributed. But the impulsive noise samples make the overall noise PDF leptokurtic and restrict the traditional AWGN receivers from providing optimal performance. This gives us a motivation to design new receivers for achieving improved performance of UWA links in the presence of leptokurtic noise. In literature, leptokurtic noise has been well-described by the Generalized Gaussian (GG) statistics. In this paper also the same has been considered and an optimal receiver has been designed accordingly. Performance of the proposed receiver has been evaluated in the presence of simulated as well as sea-recorded leptokurtic noise. Results show that using the optimal GG noise receiver improves system performance in comparison to traditional AWGN receivers not only in ideal distortion-less channels but also in multipath UWA channels. © 2017 IEEE.",Gaussian distribution; Generalized Gaussian; Leptokurtic noise; non-Gaussian statistics; Probability of error; Underwater acoustic noise,Acoustic noise; Error statistics; Gaussian distribution; Impulse noise; Probability density function; Signal processing; Underwater acoustics; White noise; Generalized Gaussian; Generalized Gaussian noise; Leptokurtic noise; Non-Gaussian statistics; Probability of errors; Reliable communication; Signal processing technique; Underwater communication; Gaussian noise (electronic),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,OCEANS - Aberdeen,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044660501

India has 17% of world's population suffering from breast cancer. World Health Organization's International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimates that more than 4,00,000 women die every year due to breast cancer. Thus early identification of breast cancer plays a vital role in reducing the mortality rate. Medical infrared thermography is gaining popularity as it can detect abnormality at an early stage when compared to mammogram. In this work an attempt has been made to distinguish healthy and pathological subjects using Bidirectional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) and uniform Rotated Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). Frontal thermogram images are pre-processed using anisotropic diffusion filtering which preserves sharp edges, fine details and effectively removes noise. Level set segmentation technique is applied on pre-processed image to obtain the required Region Of Interest (ROI). The delineated ROI's are subjected to BEMD where the image is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residue. IMF1 is considered for further processing as it contains maximum edge information about the image. Texture analysis is performed on IMF1 using uniform RLBP technique to obtain feature vector comprising of 59 unique elements. The dimensionality of features is reduced to 20 using Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). The subjects are classified using Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) classifier with different kernel functions and the classifier results are evaluated based on classifier performance measures. Analysis is performed on 43 healthy and 24 cancerous subjects chosen from DMR (Database of Mastology Research) database. The experimental results obtained by LSSVM classifier using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with ?2=3D0.5 and ?=3D1 outstands by achieving 89% accuracy. Hence the proposed system effectively distinguishes healthy and pathological subjects. © 2017 IEEE.",BEMD; IMF; LSSVM; RLBP; Thermogram,Diseases; Functions; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; International cooperation; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Anisotropic diffusion filtering; BEMD; International agency for research on cancers; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Least square support vector machines; LSSVM; RLBP; Thermogram; Medical imaging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This GMM framework does not require phoneme-level transcription and hence, it can be useful for unsupervised tasks. We propose the iterative approach for VTLN warping factor estimation with two GMM training approaches, namely, Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Deterministic Annealing-Expectation Maximization (DAEM). The VTLN-warped Gaussian posteriorgram gave the better QbESTD performance. The performance of TIMIT QbE-STD was investigated with different evaluation factors, such as a number of Gaussian components in GMM, various local constraints, and a number of iterations in VTLN warping factor estimation.

In this paper, we propose to use the IRM for non-intrusive quality assessment of noise suppressed speech. Since the quality of noise suppressed speech is dependent on the residual noise present in speech, IRM can be extremely useful for its quality assessment. The quality assessment problem is posed as a regression problem and the mapping between statistics of acoustic features, namely, Mel Filterbank Energies (FBEs) plus IRM features and the subjective score of the corresponding utterances was found using single-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results of our experiments suggest that by using the mean of FBEs and IRM features as the input, the quality prediction accuracy was significantly increased. © 2016 IEEE.",,Audition; Hearing aids; Network layers; Neural networks; Signal processing; Speech; Speech enhancement; Acoustic features; Effective tool; Ideal ratio mask; Noise robust speech recognition; Quality assessment; Quality prediction; Regression problem; Speech segregation; Speech recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

Beginning with a standard uniform rectangular array (URA) consisting of M = Mx My sensors, this paper proposes a simpler modification by adding a N 1 delay channel network to only one of the sensor. A larger array is then formed by combining the sub-Nyquist sampled outputs of URA and the delay channel network, referred to as the difference space-time (DST) array. Towards estimating the joint frequency and 2-D DOA on this DST array, a new method utilizing the 3-D spatial smoothing for rank enhancement and a subspace algorithm based on ESPRIT is presented. Furthermore, it is shown that an ADC sampling frequency of fs B suffices, where B is the bandwidth of the narrow-band signal. With the proposed approach, it is shown that O(MN=4) frequencies and their 2-D DOAs can be estimated even when all frequencies alias to the same frequency due to sub-Nyquist sampling.

Space-borne Hyperion data was acquired for two different dates (October, 2006 & January, 2011). Endmembers were picked up from highest percentage occupancy of a class. Classification was performed on a combination of bands coming from specific absorptive features of endmember spectra (VIS (458nm-702nm) and SWIR-I (1548nm-1780nm)). SFF & SAM were applied on two identified band combinations a) 25bands (VIS) & b) 49 bands (VIS+SWIR-I). SFF was performed on Continuum Removed (CR) spectra and SAM on Continuum Intact (CI) spectra. Overall accuracy (OAA) levels were different for the two band combinations, two algorithms and also for the two images. For October data, SFF gave 61% and 49% OAA using VIS+SWIR-1 bands and VIS bands respectively. The SAM classifier performed better for both the selected spectral regions (70% and 67% respectively). SAM showed better performance with 68% using VIS bands and SFF gave good OAA (56%) with VIS+SWIR-1 band combination for January data.

Spirometry is a pulmonary function test used to measure forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) when a subject exhales in the spirometry sensor after taking a deep breath. FEV1%, FVC% and their ratio are typically used to determine the asthma severity. Accurate prediction of these spirometry readings from cough and wheeze could help patients to non-invasively monitor their asthma severity in the absence of spirometry. We use statistical spectrum description (SSD) as the cue from cough and wheeze signal to predict the spirometry readings using support vector regression (SVR). We perform experiments with cough and wheeze recordings from 16 healthy persons and 12 patients. We find that the coughs are better predictor of spirometry readings compared to the wheeze signal. FEV1%, FVC% and their ratio are predicted with root mean squared error of 11.06%, 10.3% and 0.08 respectively.

In specific, use of classification algorithms to highly multivariate non-stationary recordings like EEG is a challenging and promising task. This study investigated two substantial novelty of the topics, (1) Distinction between meditation (Kriya Yoga) and non-meditation state allied EEG, (2) Characterization of the underlying mechanism of cognitive process that is associated with meditation using topographical analysis. The topographic wavelet coherence based brain connectivity between two different groups is shown. Two groups of data, one with 23 meditators (meditator group) and other with ten non-meditators (controlled group) are analyzed. The spatial distribution between two groups can be well distinguished by the topographical approach. The quantification has been done by the colour intensity embedded in the topographical plots. The wavelet coherence is found to be a different parameter to represent the distinctiveness between two groups. The time-frequency quantification regarding wavelet coherence spectrum is shown the unique patterns among meditators and non-meditators. Thus time-frequency based wavelet coherence has found to be an unusual brain pattern in the distinction between meditators and non-meditators. © EURASIP 2017.",,Brain; Interfaces (computer); Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Brain connectivity; Classification algorithm; Cognitive activities; Cognitive process; Pattern analysis; Time frequency; Topographical analysis; Wavelet coherences; Brain computer interface,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

TEO can track energy as a function of both amplitude and frequency of an audio signal. TEO is better for capturing energy variations in the signal that is produced by a real physical system, such as, environmental sounds that contain amplitude and frequency modulations. In proposed feature set, we have used Gammatone filterbank since it represents characteristics of human auditory processing. Here, we have used two classifiers, namely, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using cepstral features, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using spectral features. We performed experiments on two datasets, namely, ESC-50, and UrbanSound8K. We compared TEO-based coefficients with Mel filter cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Gammatone cepstral coefficients (GTCC), in which GTCC used mean square energy. Using GMM, the proposed TEO-based Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (TEO-GTCC), and its score-level fusion with MFCC gave absolute improvement of 0.45 %, and 3.85 % in classification accuracy over MFCC on ESC-50 dataset. Similarly, on UrbanSound8K dataset the proposed TEO-GTCC, and its scorelevel fusion with GTCC gave absolute improvement of 1.40 %, and 2.44 % in classification accuracy over MFCC. Using CNN, the score-level fusion of Gammatone spectral coefficient (GTSC) and the proposed TEO-based Gammatone spectral coefficients (TEO-GTSC) gave absolute improvement of 14.10 %, and 14.52 % in classification accuracy over Mel filterbank energies (FBE) on ESC-50 and UrbanSond8K datasets, respectively. This shows that proposed TEO-based Gammatone features contain complementary information which is helpful in ESC task. © EURASIP 2017.",,Filter banks; Gaussian distribution; Neural networks; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; Speech recognition; Amplitude and frequency modulations; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Environmental sound classifications; Gaussian Mixture Model; Real physical systems; Spectral coefficients; Teager energy operators; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

Training these models typically requires a considerable number of keyword examples. In this work, we consider a scenario where very few keyword examples are available for training. The availability of a limited number of training examples results in a PPM with poorly learnt parameters. We propose an unsupervised online learning algorithm that starts from a poor PPM model and updates the PPM parameters using newly detected samples of the keyword in a corpus under consideration and uses the updated model for further keyword detection. We test our algorithm on eight keywords taken from the TIMIT database, the training set of which, on average, has 469 samples of each keyword. With an initial set of only five samples of a keyword (corresponds to ?1% of the total number of samples) followed by the proposed online parameter updating throughout the entire TIMIT train set, the performance on the TIMIT test set using the final model is found to be comparable to that of a PPM trained with all the samples of the respective keyword available from the entire TIMIT train set. © 2016 IEEE.",,Learning algorithms; Signal processing; Keyword detections; Keyword spotting; Number of samples; On-line parameter; Timit database; Training example; Training sets; Unsupervised online learning; E-learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

This paper describes a bird activity detector which utilises a support vector machine (SVM) with a dynamic kernel. Dynamic kernels are used to process sets of feature vectors having different cardinalities. Probabilistic sequence kernel (PSK) is one such dynamic kernel. The PSK converts a set of feature vectors from a recording into a fixed-length vector. We propose to use a variant of PSK in this work. Before computing the fixed-length vector, cepstral mean and variance normalisation and short-time Gaussianization is performed on the feature vectors. This reduces environment mismatch between different recordings. Additionally, we also demonstrate a simple procedure to speed up the proposed method by reducing the size of fixed-length vector. A speedup of almost 70% is observed, with a very small drop in accuracy.

The proposed method extracts a convex representation (frame-wise) by projecting a given audio signal on to a learned dictionary. The AA based dictionary is trained only on bird class signals, which makes the method robust to background noise. Further, it is shown that due to the inherent sparsity property of convex representations, non-bird class signals will have a denser representation as compared to the bird counterpart, which helps in effective discrimination. In order to detect presence/absence of bird vocalization, a fixed length representation is obtained by averaging the obtained frame wise representations of an audio signal. Classification of these fixed length representations is performed using support vector machines (SVM) with a dynamic kernel. In this work, we propose a variant of probabilistic sequence kernel called sparse convex sequence kernel (SCSK) for the BAD task.

The proposed method employs multiple dictionaries to effectively model variations present in the speech signal. Here, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is built using spectral features corresponding to frames of all the examples of a speech class. Multiple dictionaries corresponding to different mixture are learned using the respective speech frames. Given a train/test speech frame, minimum spectral distance measure from the GMM means is employed to select an appropriate dictionary. The selected dictionary is used to obtain the sparse feature representation, which is used for the classification of speech units. The effectiveness of the proposed feature is demonstrated using continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) based classifiers for (i) classification of isolated utterances of E-set of English alphabet, (ii) classification of consonant-vowel (CV) segments in Hindi language and (iii) classification of phoneme from TIMIT phonetic corpus.

One of the main requirements of compressive sensing is the sparsity of the class of signals of interest in some basis. A method to construct a sparsifying basis for a class of signals using information theoretic measures is proposed in this paper. The algorithm constructs the sparsifying basis from a known nonsparsifying basis by concentrating the probability distribution of the basis in the representation of a class of signals. Simulation studies using speech and image signals confirm that the basis constructed using the proposed method results in an improved sparsity of the signals with thresholded coefficients but without degrading the signal quality. © EURASIP 2017.",Compressed sensing; Representation entropy; Sparse modeling; Sparse representation; Transform learning,Compressed sensing; Image enhancement; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Probability; Probability distributions; Compressive sensing; High probability; Information theoretic measure; Signal acquisitions; Signals of interests; Simulation studies; Sparse modeling; Sparse representation; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

Conventional speech synthesis systems has separate modeling for pitch (F0-model) and spectral representation, namely Mel generalized coefficients (MGC) (MGC-model). In this paper we estimate pitch from the MGC estimated using MGC-model instead of having a separate F0-model. Pitch is obtained from the estimated MGC using a statistical mapping through Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Experiments using CMU-ARCTIC database demonstrate that the proposed GMM based F0-model, even with a single mixture, results in no significant loss in the naturalness of the synthesized speech while the proposed F0-model, in addition to reducing computational complexity, results in -93% reduction in the number of parameters compared to that of the F0-model. © EURASIP 2017.",,Gaussian distribution; Signal processing; Speech synthesis; User interfaces; Wearable technology; Computationally efficient; Gaussian Mixture Model; Generalized coefficients; Spectral representations; Speech synthesis system; Synthesized speech; Text-to-speech system; Wearable devices; Continuous speech recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

Due to the use of more deeper networks significant improvement in the performances has been observed and developing deep learning methods to train more deeper architectures has gained a lot of scientific interest. Optimizing a deeper network is more complex task than to optimize a less deeper network, but recently residual network have exhibited a capability to train a very deep neural network architectures and are not prone to vanishing/exploding gradient problems. In this work, the effectiveness of residual networks have been explored for of speech recognition. Along with the depth of the residual network, the criticality of width of the residual network has also been studied. It has been observed that at higher depth, width of the networks is also a crucial parameter for attaining significant improvements.

Moreover, the variance of a feature with a few samples is pointless unless it represents the data distribution efficiently. Instead of looking at the samples in groups, we evaluate their efficiency based on pairwise fashion.

We derive an expression for the degrees of freedom and the number of consecutive values in the difference set for the prototype co-prime array. This work shows that, under the wide sense stationarity (WSS) condition, larger consecutive difference values can be achieved by using the union of all the difference sets. We provide a closed-form expression in order to determine the number of sample pairs that are available for estimating the statistics for each value of the difference set, also known as the weight function. The estimation accuracy and latency depends on the number of sample pairs used for estimating the second order statistic. We also obtain the closed-form expression for the bias of the correlogram spectral estimate. Simulation results show that the co-prime based periodogram and biased correlogram estimate are equivalent, and the reconstruction using our proposed formulation provides lower latency. © EURASIP 2017.",,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Closed-form expression; Difference sets; Difference values; Number of samples; Second order statistics; Sparsity constraints; Spectral estimate; Weight functions; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

The underlying idea of this method is to generate the optimal projection matrix by retaining the original distribution of the data. Though L2-norm is generally preferred for computation, it is sensitive to noise and outliers. However, L1-norm is robust to them. Therefore, we obtain the optimal projection matrix by maximizing the ratio of between-class dispersion to within-class dispersion using L1- norm. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is described to solve the optimization problem. The experimental results of the HSI classification confirm the effectiveness of the proposed L1-SC method on both noisy and noiseless data. © 2017 EURASIP.",Dimensionality reduction; Hyperspectral classification; L1-norm; L1-SC; Scaling cut; Supervised learning,Dispersions; Graphic methods; Image classification; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Spectroscopy; Supervised learning; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction method; Hyper-spectral classification; Iterative algorithm; L1 norm; Optimization problems; Projection matrix; Scaling cut; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

Fundamental frequency (F0) of the speech signal and local variations around F0 are the characteristics of glottal excitation source. Extraction of this information from the speech spectrum can be used to estimate epochs (since higher harmonics interact with the vocal tract characteristics, they no longer represent the true glottal source). In this paper, we bandpass filter the speech signal through a novel Gaussian filterbank followed by simple peak detection to extract epochs. We do not attempt any post processing to study the effectiveness of F0 on epoch estimation in the proposed method. The algorithm is validated on various databases and compared with four state-of-the-art methods.

Classification of normal and aggressive actions are essential for diseases and prosthetic arm controls. But accurate classification of physical actions are sometimes not possible using raw EMG signals. To enhance the classification accuracy feature extraction is an essential criterion. Hence in this work wavelet analysis is used for feature extraction from EMG signals to provide a suitable pattern to the ANFIS based classifier. The EMG signals are decomposed using DB-4 wavelet up to level 5 and approximate coefficients are extracted. Approximate coefficients from the signals are taken as input to the ANFIS module to classify the physical actions. The proposed method is validated using various test cases and it is observed that accuracy of the proposed method is up to 98% from all the tested cases. © 2017 IEEE.,ANFIS; Artificial Intelligence; Electromyography (EMG); Physical Action Classification; Signal Processing; Wavelet analysis,Artificial intelligence; Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Nanotechnology; Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; ANFIS; Classification accuracy; Electromyography signals; EMG signal; Intelligent method; Physical action; Prosthetic arm; Biomedical signal processing,"Swetapadma, A.; KIIT University, Bhubaneswar School of Computer EngineeringIndia; email: aleena.swetapadma@gmail.com",Taki G.S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Apart from the planting multiple tea varieties, growth of natural vegetation species is common scenario in plantations. The objective of this research was spectral discrimination of nine important tea varieties in the presence of six natural vegetation species in Munnar, Western Ghat highlands of south India. Discrimination models using six methods: k-nearest neighborhood classifier (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), normalized spectral similarity score (NS3), maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied on the hyperspectral reflectance measurements collected at canopy level. The existence and statistical significance of spectral differences of the tea and natural vegetation species were assessed by MANOVA. Results indicate that six out of 9 tea varieties could be discriminated with best accuracies 75 to 80%. While a closer spectral similarity is observed in few tea varieties, the presence of natural vegetation species has decreased inter species variability for few tea varieties while enhancing the same for few other tea varieties at the cost of reducing spectral separability among the vegetation species. © 2014 IEEE.",classification; hyperspectral species level discrimination; MANOVA; spectral matching; Tea plantations,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Image processing; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Vegetation; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral reflectance; Linear discriminant analysis; MANOVA; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Spectral matchings; Statistical significance; Tea plantations; Signal processing,"Nidamanuri, R.R.; Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: rao@iist.ac.in",,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78147E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

The imaging technique of X-ray computed tomography has caused a great revolution in the field of medical radiology. But later, combined with sophisticated computer signal processing the image of any cross section of a biological target could be obtained free of interfering shadows from structure within the cross section which cannot obstruct image formation. But gradual awareness of the danger of ionizing radiation made CT using X-ray unsuitable for mass screening of female breast for detection of cancerous tumors. As a result, in recent years much attention has been concentrated on imaging with alternative forms of energy like ultrasound, low level microwaves and NMR. Unfortunately, the qualities of tomographic reconstruction obtained with sound or electromagnetic radiation are inferior to those obtained with X-rays. The inherent success of CT using X-ray lies in the fact that X-rays, being non-diffracting travel in straight line and therefore the projection data measure the line integral of some object parameter along straight lines. This makes it possible to apply a Fourier Slice Theorem, which says that the Fourier Transform of a projection equals to the slice of 2D Fourier Transform of the object. © 2017 IEEE.",Breast Cancer; Mammography; Tomography,Diagnosis; Diagnostic radiography; Diseases; Electromagnetic waves; Fourier transforms; Imaging techniques; Ionizing radiation; Mammography; Medical imaging; Nanotechnology; Radiotherapy; Signal processing; Tomography; Ultrasonic applications; X ray radiography; 2d fourier transforms; Biological targets; Breast Cancer; Fourier slice theorem; Three-dimensional body; Tomographic reconstruction; Two-dimensional projection; X-ray computed tomography; Computerized tomography,,Taki G.S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The demand for such a high computational requirement is often met by using software methods to accelerate the computation, which is possible only to a certain extent, impairing the feasibility of real-time imaging and diagnosis. In this paper, a new method of using digital signal processors (DSPs) with a specialized pipelined vision processor (PVP) embedded at the hardware level to accelerate the routinely time-consuming imaging computation is proposed and validated. A lab prototype is built for the feasibility study and clinical validation of the proposed technique. This unique architecture of the PVP in a dual-core DSP offers a high-performance accelerated framework along with its large on-chip memory resources, and reduced bandwidth requirement provides as an ideal architecture for reliable medical computational needs. We have taken two sets sample studies from SPECT for validation - 27 cases of thyroid medical history and 20 cases of glomerular filtration rate of kidneys. The results were compared with definitive post-scan SIEMENS image analysis software. From the statistical results, it is clearly shown that this method achieved very superior accuracy and 250% acceleration of computational speed. © 2013 IEEE.",bio medical imaging; digital signal processing (DSP); pipelined vision processor (PVP); System on chip (SoC),Acceleration; Bioinformatics; Biomedical equipment; Biomedical signal processing; Computer hardware; Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Hardware; Image processing; Integrated circuit design; Interactive computer systems; Medical imaging; Pipeline processing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Real time systems; System-on-chip; Biomedical imaging; Digital signal processing (DSP); Signal processing algorithms; System on chips (SoC); Vision processor; Signal processing,"Ravi, M.; Department of Physics, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher LearningIndia; email: muraliravi@sssihl.edu.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032684336

The proposed scheme is applied for secure medical information transmission or its cloud storage. The scheme is implemented in two steps. In first step, randomization of patient information is done based on a password secret key before embedding it into the cover medical image. Second step is to hide the watermarked image into a secret key image before cloud storage so that even if the stored image is hacked or leaked, the cover medical image along with embedded patient information cannot be retrieved by the hacker. In this paper we have proposed a novel watermarking algorithm for medical images by randomizing the information according to the secret password key and then embedding it into the cover medical image followed by embedding of cover image into another secret key image. The proposed scheme aims to protect sensitive information transfer and cloud storage from unauthorized access. Extraction of the embedded information at the receiver end is done in two steps. Firstly, non-blind detection is carried out in which cover medical image is extracted with help of secret key image. In the second step, binary image watermark is extracted by analyzing the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient values. Performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by varying the quality factor of JPEG compression and sub-band decomposition levels. © 2017 IEEE.",Block DCT; Data hiding; DWT domain watermarking; Medical image processing,Access control; Authentication; Binary images; Cryptography; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Image processing; Image watermarking; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Personal computing; Signal processing; Block DCT; Data hiding; Embedded information; Sensitive informations; Subband decomposition; Unauthorized access; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking schemes; Image compression,,Herencsar N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Here, in this paper Histogram technique is applied to correct baseline drift. Histogram, which gives the distribution of data based on its frequency of appearance is used to correct the baseline for various samples acquired from PTB diagnostic ECG database. The logic is applied by keeping in mind that the iso-electric or baseline is that portion of the ECG which shows the absence of electrical activity of the heart. Moreover after correction of the ECG baseline drift, the RR interval and heart rate is estimated. Further using the RR interval along the different statistical features like mean, median, mode, histogram the regularly irregular characteristics of the ECG is estimated and verified by manual observing.

Classification of the ground surface into several classes facilitate in understanding the changes caused by climate, natural and human activities. For this purpose, hyperspectral images provide high spectral information. Due to poor spatial resolution the IFOV of the sensor contains many classes and the spectra obtained are often mixture of two classes. This results in misclassification. In this paper, sub-pixel analysis of hyperspectral images is carried out to deal with the mixed pixel problem. We propose a technique based on Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) which utilizes the spectral information to generate spatially high resolution images. Sub-pixel mapping implies division of mixed pixels into sub-pixels and allocating classes to them based on spatial contiguity and abundance fractions. To solve this spatial optimization problem, ACO has been applied which has shown significant improvement in the classification results. © 2016 IEEE.",Ant colony optimization; Hyperspectral data; Mixed pixel; Sub-pixel mapping; Super-resolution,Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Independent component analysis; Mapping; Optical resolving power; Optimization; Pixels; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Classification results; High resolution image; Hyperspectral Data; Mixed pixel; Remotely sensed images; Sub-pixel mapping; Super resolution; Ant colony optimization,,,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78151E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

Segmentation and 3D reconstruction also uses the detection of tumor from an MR image. The manual tracing and visual exploration by doctors will be restrained in order to avoid time consumption. The brain tumor detection allows localizing a mass of abnormal cells in a slice of Magnetic Resonance (MR) using SVM Classifier and segmentation of the tumor cells to know about the size of the tumor present in that segmented area.

Sensors nodes are energy constraints devices. For the sustainability of sensor networks energy optimization is the prime challenge for researchers which can be achieved by efficient design of clustering routing protocols. LEACH is one of the most renowned hierarchical routing protocols which prepare the fields for many other routing protocols for WSN. An enhanced version of LEACH is the EEEAC protocol which is an adaptive clustering based on residual energy of each node and generated uniform cluster heads over the network. Unlike EEEAC which considers unique identification of subarea code, for locating the nodes position in this paper we use the threshold level of mean link quality of sensor node for sub-area division. This process reduces the cost complexity and size of sensor nodes and non-functioning of GPS within indoor environment for area division. The significant contribution of this work lies in the real test bed implementation of both LEACH and our proposed model under SENSEnuts. Network stability and battery consumption are evaluated practically which shows that the modified EEEAC (mEEEAC) is the more energy efficient enhancing network lifetime. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; energy efficient protocol; Hierarchical routing; Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH); TDMA schedule; Wireless Sensor networks (WSN),Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Low power electronics; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Sustainable development; Time division multiple access; clustering; Clustering routing protocol; Energy Efficient clustering; Energy efficient protocols; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hierarchical routings; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Normally, Sleeping can be identified from several factors like eye blink level, yawning, gripping force on the wheel and so on. But all these measuring techniques will check only the physical activities of the human. In some cases, people will mentally sleep with eyes open for a few seconds. This will make very big accidents in driving. The key work of the project is analysing the brain signals. Human brain consists of millions of interconnected neurons. This neuron pattern will change according to the human thoughts. If a person is mentally sleeping with eyes open then the attention level brain signal will get changed compared to the normal condition.

To resolve such issues multi user multiple-input/output (MU-MIMO) system is established in that multi cluster heads are implemented in each cluster to facilitate dual data uploading and to balance workload. Wireless sensor networks which works as a sensor nodes senses the data and SenCar collects information from environment. Then data is forwarded to sink node from SenCar via single or multiple hops. WSN is proved to be a effective in fields like medical, military, home etc. But authentication is essential in such fields.

A wall shaped raised ground structure (RGS) is used around the stacked rectangular microstrip patch to widen the beamwidth. A material with very low dielectric constant is used to fill the space left between RGS and two layers of rectangular microstrip patch. Low dielectric constant makes the antenna less dependent on the finite size of ground plane or the host structure due to the absence of higher order modes of surface waves and retains the purity of broad radiation beam. In order to separate radiating patch from its feeding structure and for circular polarization (CP), a crossed slot aperture coupled technique is used. A nozzle shaped conformal radome is used to protect antenna from the environmental hazards and to reduce aerodynamic drag as well. It is observed that antenna provides excellent electrical and radiation characteristics. 10-dB Return loss bandwidth of 30%, 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 15%, realized gain of 6.2 dBiC, 3-dB beamwidth of 110° × 110° and 3-dB axial ratio beamwidth of 170° × 175° at center frequency of 9.45 GHz of X-band are observed. © 2017 IEEE.",broadband; circularly polarised; conformal radome; microstrip patch; widebeam,Aerodynamic drag; Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Circular polarization; Directional patterns (antenna); Microstrip devices; Microwave antennas; Nozzles; Radomes; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Surface waves; broadband; circularly polarised; Micro-strip patch antennas; Microstrip patch; Polarized microstrip patch antennas; Radiation characteristics; Rectangular microstrip patch; Wide-beam; Microstrip antennas,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

BhrtyArtana (where 'Bhrtya' means robot and 'Artana' means waste) is an automated sewer robot that cai conduct an inspection of the sewage pipeline and clear any blockage within it. The robot first inspects sewer lines for cracks, corrosion obstacles, etc. A camera installed atop the robot carries out live streaming of the interior of the pipeline. These visuals are viewed b the operator in software to be recorded for future reference. Furthermore, the robot is equipped with a proximity sensor at the front o its body to detect the presence of an obstacle in front of it. As the robot nears the obstacle, the turbine starts cutting through th obstacle, thus, clearing the obstacle.

Among assorts of neuroimaging techniques, electroencephalogram (EEG) is among one of the non-invasive methods exploited mostly in BCI studies. Recent studies have shown that Motor Imagery (MI) based BCI can be used as a rehabilitation tool for patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities. The spatial and spectral information related to brain activities associated with BCI paradigms are usually predetermined as default in EEG analysis without speculation, which can lead to loses effects in practical applications due to individual variability across different subjects. Recent studies have shown that feature combination of each specifically tailored for different physiological phenomena such as Readiness Potential (RP) and Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) might benefit BCI making it robust against artifacts. Hence, the objective is to design a CSSBP with combined feature vectors, where the signal is divided into several sub bands using a band pass filter, and this channel and frequency configurations are then modeled as preconditions before learning base learners and introducing a new heuristic of stochastic gradient boost for training the base learners under these preconditions. The effectiveness and robustness of this algorithm along with feature combination is evaluated on two different data sets recorded from distinct populations. Results showed that Boosting approach with feature combination clearly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms, and improved the classification performance and resulted in increased robustness. This method can also be used to explore the neurophysiological mechanism of underlying brain activities.",Brain computer interface; Feature combination; Motor imagery; Rehabilitation training; Spatial-spectral precondition; Stochastic gradient boosting,Bandpass filters; Bioinformatics; Brain; Electroencephalography; Interfaces (computer); Neuroimaging; Neurophysiology; Neurosurgery; Noninvasive medical procedures; Patient rehabilitation; Population statistics; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Feature combination; Motor imagery; Rehabilitation training; Spatial-spectral precondition; Stochastic gradient boosting; Brain computer interface,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

After enabling, the application starts to work and alerts the user under three different scenarios. First is a location based alert, where the GPS continuously collects the current latitude and longitude of the user and alerts him through his headphone speaker with a voice message when he is in careful zone such as railway station, highways, railway track. Second is a high pitch alert, which is triggered when the headphones microphone receives a high pitch sound such as vehicle horn from the surrounding. Third is a calling alert that will be raised when someone from nearest surrounding calls the mobile user by his name or other general context such as sir, excuse me, madam and so on.

One of the most important and challenging issue in the data stream domain is the classification of the big datasets. However the conventional classification methods developed to run in a streaming environment with high use of memory constraints and longer execution running time. Another three major important issues in the data stream classification methods are huge length, conception drift and Feature Selection (FS). In this review paper, we consider the difficult problem of FS algorithms for streaming data, in which the size of streaming data for the feature set is unknown, primary to an inflexible demand in computation constraints, and not every feature is available from classifier model. In order to solve this difficulty, Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms are performed on the high dimensionality and streaming big dataset samples which result in increase classification accuracy, less memory consumption and lesser running time when compared to the existing streaming FS algorithms on various datasets. The proposed SI based FS algorithms overcomes the difficulty of the traditional FS algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Big data; Data Stream Mining; Data streams classification; Feature Selection (FS); metaheuristics; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Swarm Intelligence (SI),Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Signal processing; Swarm intelligence; Classification accuracy; Conventional classification methods; Data stream; Data stream classifications; Data stream mining; Feature selection algorithm; Hardware and software; Meta heuristics; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In contrast, proper formulation of the problem so that the task of quality assessment of an image can be performed automatically, is a complex task and hence, designing objective No-Reference (NR) quality measurement algorithms is indeed very difficult. Existing approaches identify the degradation from among a set of degradations commonly experienced during image transmission and handling. However, apart from the inadequacy of being unable to indicate the amount of degradation they tend to reflect the overall degradation rather than being sensitive to one kind of degradation. The problem of correctly assessing the level of degradation is crucial since the choice of an appropriate restoration technique is heavily dependent on this. Further, in practical situations, the problem is compounded by the presence of other degradations acting as confounding factors such as noise. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it is designed to work well in situations where JPEG compressed images have been subjected to noise. Its performance has been tested through simulations on a large number of images from several popular databases. Results have also been compared with those obtained from subjective tests on the same images. © 2017 IEEE.",,Image analysis; Image processing; Signal processing; Distorted images; Human observers; JPEG compressed images; No references; Original images; Quality assessment; Quality measurements; Restoration techniques; Image quality,,Struc V.Kovacic S.Kristan M.Loncaric S.Vucic M.,IEEE Computer Society,18455921,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Hence there is a demand of water management system for agriculture which will maximize the crop yield. In this paper a novel approach is made to design and fabricate a closed-loop control system for soil-moisture monitoring and controlling. It is achieved through deployment of proposed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) model in agriculture field. Since the end users are farmers, the cost of the product holds great importance. In market there are many WSN motes available but they are not application specific. The costs of these motes are much higher and beyond the reach of farmers. Due to this reason we have designed new sensor nodes with the help of Arduino Platform and Raspberry Pi module to minimize the cost of entire product. Selection of hardware component, firmware development, integration and field implementation, testing and optimization are the processes that have been followed to develop the product. The benefit of such design is to control all desired parameters for WSN according to own application requirement that sometimes is not achievable from the marketed product. © 2017 IEEE.",End Device; Firmware; Gateway; Raspberry Pi; Router; Soil-Moisture; WSN,Agriculture; Closed loop control systems; Commerce; Costs; Crops; Firmware; Gateways (computer networks); Integration testing; Moisture; Moisture control; Product design; Routers; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Soil moisture; Water management; Water resources; Agriculture applications; Application requirements; Application specific; End-devices; Field implementation; Hardware components; Soil moisture monitoring; Water management systems; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The chebyshev impedance matching is one of the best techniques to produce large bandwidth in log-periodic antenna. In this paper four arm log-periodic antenna is designed for the both linear and circular polarization. When the 900 phase delay applied between the two dipoles the antenna produce circular polarization. The antenna is operated at 3GHz gives the band of operation from 2GHz band upto K/Ka band.

This proposed work uses the property of orthogonality of Tchebichef transform. Different block sizes (i.e. 4×4, 8×8, 16×16, and 32×32) of DCT and DTT are performed on different class of images. From the results, it was observed that the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) in case of DTT is better when compared to DCT. The computational complexity of DCT and DTT remains same because only the transform coefficients are different in both cases. Thus DTT can be preferable compared to DCT for image/video compression. © 2017 IEEE.",Discrete Chebychev polynomials; Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); Discrete Tchebichef Transform (DTT); Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR),Image coding; Image compression; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Video cameras; Chebychev polynomials; Different class; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Discrete tchebichef transforms; Orthogonality; Peak signal to noise ratio; Performance comparison; Transform coefficients; Discrete cosine transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

But during migrating live virtual machines along with system files and storage data, network traffic gets increases across network bandwidth and delays in migration time. There is need to reduce the migration time in order to maintain the system performance by analyzing and optimizing the storage overheads which mainly creates due to unnecessary duplicated data transferred during live migration. So there is need of such storage device which will keep the duplicated data residing in both the source as well as target physical host i.e. NAS. The proposed hash map based algorithm maps all I/O operations in order to track the duplicated data by assigning hash value to both NAS and RAM data.

In literature, several experimental, simulation and theoretical studied are available for PCA operating as a source.

An image is blurred due to motion between the camera or sensor and the object, defocusing of the lens, atmospheric turbulence, etc. Images can be restored if information about the original image or the blur is known. Degradation due defocus blur is considered in this paper. The estimation of defocus blur radius is treated as a classification problem here. A technique to classify the blur radius using random forest classifier is proposed in this paper. Third and fourth statistical moments, calculated on the spectrum of the blurred image are used as features for classification in the proposed method. The proposed technique is applied on images from the USC-SIPI Image database. The experiment results display defocus radius classification accuracy of 94.37%.

Here, the MLP initially trained using a few labeled samples is used to predict the class labels of the unlabeled samples to obtain soft class labels. The soft class labels of each unlabelled samples are boosted with respect to that of their k nearest neighbors. This is done to exploit the spatial relationship among the patterns. Finally re-training for MLP is carried out iteratively by using the available labeled samples along with the selected samples from the most confidently predicted ones. The retraining continues until the prediction values are significantly stable across iterations. Here a differential weighted mean of k neighborhood is used for boosting of soft class label and a semi-automatic threshold selection algorithm is investigated to identify the most confidently predicted samples. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, experiments on land-cover classification are conducted on patterns from Landsat8 satellite images for two different geographical regions. The obtained results outperform the corresponding supervised strategy under the scenario of labeled data scarcity. © 2017 IEEE.",k-nearest neighbor; Kmeans clustering; Land-cover classification; Multilayer Perceptron; Semi-supervised learning,Geographical regions; Image classification; Iterative methods; Membership functions; Motion compensation; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Nearest neighbor search; Supervised learning; Text processing; K-means clustering; K-nearest neighbors; Land cover classification; Multi layer perceptron; Remotely sensed images; Semi- supervised learning; Spatial relationships; Unlabeled samples; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Set point filter is widely used for reducing peak overshoot in various procees. There are different anti integral windup methods such as back calculation and conditional integration are used for eliminating integral windup action, which improves system performance. For achieving the advantage of set point filter and anti integral windup strategy, a newly proposed method of set point filter based anti integral windup PID controller with integral state predictor is used in thermal process. PID controller is used in a process, due to integral windup phenomenon, performance degradation and large peak overshoot will appear. The steady state value of integral state is predicted while PID controller output is saturated and its value is utilized as initial value of integral state when PID controller begins to operate in a linear range. Set point filter is designed by using peak overshoot and peak time of system response. The proposed method is applied on FOPDT transfer function of a thermal process and studied using MATLAB Simulink tool. The Simulation results shows that performance of the process is improved and peak overshoot is reduced. © 2017 IEEE.",Anti Integral Windup; FOPDT; Intergral state Predictor; PID Controller; Setpoint Filter,Bandpass filters; Controllers; Electric control equipment; MATLAB; Proportional control systems; Signal processing; Three term control systems; Anti Integral Windup; FOPDT; Intergral state Predictor; PID controllers; Setpoints; Process control,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Image segmentation for the detection of diseases is done using Gabor filter that in turn uses shift-add CORDIC algorithm for making the designing of Gabor filter easier. In addition to this algorithm, we use a new algorithm called Variable Thresholding algorithm that sets a threshold value during the decision making period. The algorithm is named variable because, the threshold value can be varied depending upon the diseases we are going to detect. All these algorithms are written in VHDL Language in MODELSIM software, which makes the designing and decision making process more effective.

The changes in the vessel characteristics such as tortuosity may be used to estimate the effect of hypertension. In this paper, a simple distance metric (DM) method is used to evaluate the tortuosity of blood vessels. Initially, the method is applied on synthetically generated blood vessels of normal, moderate and severely tortuous nature. Then retinal vessels are segmented using image processing methods. Small vessel segments are selected manually and used for tortuosity evaluation. These images are collected from local eye hospital, DRIVE database and VICAVR database. The results obtained show that the method is capable enough to estimate the tortuosity and have close correlation with subjective evaluation of tortuosity. © 2017 IEEE.",blood vessel; distance metric; retina; toruosity,Image processing; Ophthalmology; Processing; Signal processing; Distance metrics; Image processing - methods; retina; Retinal blood vessels; Retinal disease; Retinal vessels; Subjective evaluations; toruosity; Blood vessels,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The proposed design unites the advantages such as low fabrication cost, low signal losses, planer profile, easily integrated with the other microwave devices and high performance in microwave application. The transmission coefficients S21 and S 31 shows that the input power (3W) in a waveguide is equally split into -8dB power or combined -8dB power in needed manner by using presented SIW Y junction. The divided E-fields are in same phase as the E-field at the input. The propagation direction of electromagnetic waves is not always straight and if the direction of wave changes in bounded medium, it encounters bending loss which is due to reflection of wave from chamfer less bends. Thus, for direction change in bounded medium without incurring bending loss, chamfer bends have been designed. The study contributes the designing and analysis of chamfered microwave bends in proposed rectangular substrate integrated waveguide. These newly designed bends are optimized in V-band [40-75 GHz] at super high frequency of 55 GHz. The proposed SIW Y junction is designed on RT Duroid substrate and the measured results demonstrate that The return loss is -44.5668 dB, VSWR at the output port is 1.1 & 1.2 and reflection loss is 0.0059 dB at 55 GHz frequency. Thus, through the study of results, proposed SIW Y junction is very effective for signal transmission with low losses over entire V-band. © 2017 IEEE.",Junctions; Power divider; Rectangular substrate integrated waveguide; S parameter and HFSS; Waveguide,Electromagnetic waves; Microwave devices; Scattering parameters; Signal processing; Waveguide junctions; Waveguides; Microwave applications; Power divider; Propagation direction; Reflection of waves; RT-duroid substrates; Signal transmission; Substrate integrated waveguide technologies; Transmission coefficients; Substrate integrated waveguides,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In the proposed method, the basic bidirectional-RRT star algorithm is combined with the spline technique to generate smooth trajectories, which are important for curved path navigation of a wheeled mobile robot. The bidirectional-RRT star tree structure is extended by using a spline method based on a cubic Ferguson's curve. Trajectories that are been generated using the proposed bidirectional spline-RRT star algorithm satisfies direction constraints approach on both source and target positions. This makes the proposed algorithm remarkably unlike from other trajectory planning algorithms. As a result, the paths produced by the mobile robots are sub-optimal, dynamically and geometrically feasible, and satisfy direction constraints approaches.

The sensor is made of a rectangular channel and two separate multimode optical fibers, which are properly inserted via through-holes provided at the extremities of the rectangular channel. Both the optical fibers do have a decladded zone for each to allow leakage of optical power from the zones when light is coupled into the fibers. When suitable liquid type flows inside the channel, liquid comes into contact with decladded zones thereby reducing leakage of optical power from the decladded zones. Under this condition, optical power levels available at output ends of the fibers undergo step change one after another with a time delay.

There are different types of techniques to give good quality of an image. Global image contrast enhancement is one of the most commonly used technique to enhance the quality of an image, but it has some disadvantages with the fact that it does not consider the local details of an image. Local details of an image are very important while analyzing an image, which is that of the scientific study of an image like the image taken from planetary bodies, satellite image and medical images. Local details of an image are very important for diagnosing a particular ailment. When either local contrast enhancement or global contrast enhancement is used alone, there is loss of brightness of the image. In order to address and reduce this discrepancy of individual enhancement methods, a new method is presented in this paper, that uses both local and global enhancement methods on the same image. First, the image is locally enhanced and the output is again processed by the global enhancement method thereby giving a properly enhanced image without losing the brightness of the image. This enhancement method is simulated in MATLAB and results are verified on the parameters of image quality. © 2017 IEEE.",Global contrast stretching; image enhancement; image sharpening; local contrast stretching; unsharp masking,Diagnosis; Luminance; Medical imaging; Signal processing; Global contrasts; Global enhancement; Image contrast enhancement; Image sharpening; Local contrast; Local Contrast Enhancement; Scientific studies; Unsharp masking; Image enhancement,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Cleaning robot is a part of the industrial applications. Path planning for cleaning purpose is found to be one of the major challenges of these robots, as obstacles present in the path may cause damage to them. Hence, in this research, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based obstacle detection algorithm is proposed to determine the path for cleaning robot. A grid based scenario with both static and mobile obstacles are considered to determine the path. The proposed work is simulated in MATLAB 2013b. From the results obtained it is inferred that the algorithm is validated for both cluttered and uncertainty environment, which enable to bypass the obstacles. It also ensures that the destination is attained by selecting the path without the obstacles. © 2017 IEEE.",Cleaning Robot; Obstacle Detection; Particle Swarm Optimization; Static And Mobile Obstacles,Cleaning; Motion planning; Obstacle detectors; Optimization; Robot programming; Robots; Signal processing; Swarm intelligence; Cleaning robot; Grid-based; Mobile obstacles; Obstacle detection; Uncertainty environment; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Large amount of data is produced by MRI and the task of marking the tumor slice by slice is a very tedious and time consuming process for radiologists and hence accurate and reliable segmentation methods are gaining more attention which helps radiologists for precise treatment planning. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the widely used imaging modality for visualizing and assessing the brain anatomy and its functions in non-invasive manner. In this paper a novel approach for brain tumor segmentation based on Non Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF) and Fuzzy clustering is proposed. Proposed algorithm is tested on BRATS 2012 training database of High Grade and Low Grade Glioma tumors with clinical and synthetic data of 80 patients. Various evaluation parameters like Dice index, Jaccard index, Sensitivity, Specificity are evaluated. Comparison of experimental results with other state of the art brain tumor segmentation methods demonstrate that proposed method outperforms existing segmentation techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",Brain tumor segmentation; fuzzy clustering; non-negative matrix factorization,Brain; Factorization; Fuzzy clustering; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal processing; Tumors; Automatic segmentations; Brain tumor segmentation; Evaluation parameters; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Segmentation methods; Segmentation techniques; Training database; Treatment planning; Matrix algebra,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

However, the area of mutual coupling amongst large number of antennas in an array is yet to be explored at its fullest extent. This research paper is focused on a particular structure such as polygon to reduce the mutual coupling in an array of two microstrip patch antenna. Two microstrip patch antennas, located on common substrate in close proximity of each other are designed and simulated for the performance of the system. Next, the system is analyzed for mutual coupling. Through repeated design trials and measurement, the mutual coupling is reduced to about 2 dB. The other performance parameters of the system are estimated at -45 dB of return loss and 6 dBi of gain.

The most important shortcoming of IoT cloud networks which needs immediate addressing is the issue of IoT nodes when used within a virtual network of a cloud system. The IoT nodes often communicate over a virtual network and this communication needs to be monitored and managed by the cloud service provider (CSP). This CSP needs to make sure that no IoT node with malicious intent can thrive in such a network. In this paper we propose a framework for the security over virtual network for IoT nodes in a cloud system. Firstly, we propose a secure key management protocol between the CSP and the user group having the IoT nodes using a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) model. Secondly, we device a lightweight cryptographic technique involving a key exchange protocol to establish a secure end-to-end communication between the IoT nodes. Finally we measure the efficiency and resiliency of the distribution using different metrics. © 2017 IEEE.",BIBD; Cloud Computing; communication channel; Internet of Things; Lightweight cryptography,Cloud computing; Communication channels (information theory); Cryptography; Internet of things; Mobile telecommunication systems; Signal processing; Balanced incomplete block design; BIBD; Cloud service providers; Cryptographic techniques; End-to-End communication; Internet of Things (IOT); Light-weight cryptography; Secure key distribution; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In the near-end scenario, noise can't besuppressed as it is generated in real time (background) and it reaches human ear directly. Smart way is to enhance the speech samples with respect to varying background noise. This fact opens a space for developing an algorithm that would be capable of sensing the magnitude of noise and adjusting the amplitude of the speech samples according to near-end (background) noise. Based on the noise level, speech samples can be enhanced dynamically to make it more acoustic. This work focuses on averaging the gain obtained by analyzing the speech and noise energy frame-wise to obtain the smooth gain and then implementing the Near End Listening Enhancement (NELE) algorithm on DSP TMS320C6713 processor for hardware validation.

Squid is a marine cephalopod mollusk. Each species of the squids has got its own features and to accurately classify the squids. The most dramatic differences were observed in Total length, Mantle Length, Mantle Width, Head Length, Head Width and Fin Width which could be used to distinguish squid from some of the different squids. To classifying the Squid species by taking the morphometric measurements, sometimes uncertainty will be arised by measuring features of mantle, fin and head of squid. To overcome this problem Fuzzy Inference System is used for classification of squids.

But errors do occur due to fatigue and subjectivity associated with manual color sorting of components and the productivity is also lower. The error in component color matching results in a product being rejected although all the quality parameters are otherwise met. Hence large leather product manufacturers are looking for an objective, cost effective and faster color sorting system. Reflectance spectrophotometer, which are used in quality control in color matching are too expensive and cumbersome for online color sorting. Color sensor based color sorting offers itself as an attractive option. Automatic color sorting based on color sensors has been screened for its application in fruit sorting but only one color parameter, either redness or yellowness is often used in such systems. In case of leathers, one parameter will be inadequate as the color should be the same with acceptable tolerance levels in terms of all three parameters, lightness or darkness(L), red or green(a), yellow or blue(b) in CIE coordinate system or L, c(chroma), and h(hue) in CMC coordinate system. This makes the sorting of leather components much more difficult and technologically challenging. In the present study, a color sensor based circuit has been designed and fabricated and investigated for use in leather color sorting. K-means clustering has been employed to sort the leather sample components based on L, a, b values into 4/5 clusters. The accuracy of the system has been validated and shows closer conformity with the expert opinion. © 2017 IEEE.",Arduino; cluster grouping; color sensor; Footwear component; k-means clustering; leather; manual sorting,Color; Cost effectiveness; Leather; Manufacture; Shoe manufacture; Signal processing; Arduino; Cluster-grouping; Color sensors; Footwear component; K-means clustering; Manual sorting; Color matching,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The gait signals were recorded from 15 children including normal and children diagnosed with ADHD. First step of the proposed method is the extraction of foreground objects from the human gait signals that are extracted from input video sequences. The background subtraction methods are analyzed on the basis of time and the best performed algorithm is adopted in this study. The signals are analyzed with the modified dual-Tree complex wavelet transform decompositions in order to extract gait signal features with the top ranking. A wavelet thresholding technique was employed to further improve the data eminence by denoising the pieces. In order to distinguish the active gait signals with the specialized features of ADHD children, a standard Self-Organizing Map clustering technique is used with wavelet coefficient input features. This research will lead to the creation of the cognitive theory about the ADHD children. © 2017 IEEE.",ADHD; Background subtraction; binary image; Gait; image subtraction; motion detection; time complexity,Binary images; Cognitive systems; Conformal mapping; Partial discharges; Self organizing maps; Signal processing; ADHD; Background subtraction; Gait; Image subtraction; Motion detection; Time complexity; Wavelet transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

Experiments were carried out to study the role of mirror vibrations and back-scattering from the fiber routings on the performance stability of the interferometer configuration.

Owing to the reduced energy dissipation in reversible circuits, a lot of research has been done on the design of reversible circuits. In reversible logic circuit designs, along with primary inputs, few constant inputs (Ancilla Inputs) are used to realize required reversible functions. In addition to this, few unused or extra output bits are generated; these bits are named as Garbage Output bits. A challenge in the reversible computation is to use minimum Ancilla Inputs and generate zero Garbage Outputs. In this work, we present designs for addition, subtraction, and addition or subtraction operations. The designs are primarily optimized to achieve zero Garbage Outputs and minimum Ancilla Inputs.

After eigenvalues decomposition of the covariance matrix, the original data was reconstructed using the first principal component. The mean correlation coefficient of average beat template of ICA preprocessed data and clean data, averaged over 30 volunteers is 0.9876 while that of PCA preprocessed data with clean data is 0.9778. With white Gaussian noise of known SNR, maximum absolute error for PCA preprocessed data is very small, 3.14% from SNR 25dB onwards.

This PSL behavior is observed by the matched filter (MF) response, which contains main-lobe width as well as side-lobes. Here to get a better reduction in the side-lobes, Chebyshev polynomials are modified by using zero-crossing there by getting the positive and negative pulse. Here two cases have been considered, in first ordinary Chebyshev polynomial are analyzed, second is a modification in the cycles of Chebyshev polynomial is incorporated. After this the smallest duration of the pulse has been used in determining the optimal duration which has the smallest mean square error (MSE) between the number of pulses incorporated and original signal. This is giving a much larger signal with less PSL by reducing the search domain considerably. This new method tries to implement a side lobe level reduction technique.

This is based on the assumption that one can find overlapping cliques spanning the network. That is, for each sensor, one can identify geometric neighbors for which all inter-sensor ranges are known. Such cliques can be efficiently localized using multidimensional scaling. However, since each clique is localized in some local coordinate system, we are required to register them in a global coordinate system. In other words, our approach is based on transforming the localization problem into a problem of registration. In this context, the main contributions are as follows. First, we describe an efficient method for partitioning the network into overlapping cliques. Second, we study the problem of registering the localized cliques, and formulate a necessary rigidity condition for uniquely recovering the global sensor coordinates. In particular, we present a method for efficiently testing rigidity, and a proposal for augmenting the partitioned network to enforce rigidity. A recently proposed semidefinite relaxation of global registration is used for registering the cliques. We present simulation results on random and structured sensor networks to demonstrate that the proposed method compares favourably with state-of-the-art methods in terms of run time, accuracy, and scalability. © 1991-2012 IEEE.",clique; localization; multidimensional scaling; rigidity; scalability; semidefinite programming; Sensor networks,Distributed computer systems; Global positioning system; Parallel algorithms; Rigidity; Scalability; Sensor networks; Signal processing; clique; localization; Multi-dimensional scaling; Partitioning algorithms; Registers; Semi-definite programming; Signal processing algorithms; Wireless sensor networks,"Sanyal, R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: rajatsanyal@ee.iisc.ernet.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1053587X,,ITPRE,,English,IEEE Trans Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028912216

The downscaling of gate oxide thickness to reestablish the gate voltage controllability over the channel adversely affects the reliability of the devices and circuits. The multigate transistors such as FinFET which shows superior device scalability over the planar MOSFET are also severely affected by the NBTI effects in the nanoscale regime. The time to digital converter (TDC) is a signal conditioning circuit which is used to convert the specified time interval between two events into the digital codes. The proper functioning of the TDC is based on accuracy of the propagation delay of its designed delay lines. The degradation of the delay in the delay lines due to NBTI lead to improper code conversions. The Vernier delay line TDC is designed using the 30 nm Triple Gate FinFET technology with high resolution of 10 ps.

Such multi-standard wireless communication receivers (MWCRs) need filter bank to extract the desired signal of interest from wideband input spectrum and bring it to the baseband for further signal processing tasks such as spectrum sensing, modulation classification, demodulation etc. In MWCRs, rather any wireless receivers, modulated filter banks, such as Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks (DFTFB), are preferred due to their advantages such as lower area, delay and power requirements. To support multi-standard operation, reconfigurable DFTFB (RDFTFB) was proposed by integrating DFTFB with the coefficient decimation method. In this paper, an efficient high speed implementation of RDFTFB on Virtex-7 field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) has been proposed. The proposed approach minimizes the critical path delay between clocked registers thereby leading to significant improvement in the maximum operating frequency of the RDFTFB. Numerically, the proposed implementation leads to 89.7% improvement in the maximum frequency at which RDFTFB can be clocked. Furthermore, proposed implementation leads to 18.5% reduction in the dynamic power consumption. © 2016 IEEE.",Channelization; Critical path delay; FPGA; Re-configurable Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks (RDFTFB),Bandpass filters; Clocks; Discrete Fourier transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Filter banks; Integrated circuit testing; Modulation; Radio transceivers; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal receivers; VLSI circuits; Wireless telecommunication systems; Channelization; Critical path delays; Dynamic power consumption; High speed implementation; Maximum operating frequency; Modulation classification; Next-generation wireless communications; Wireless communication receivers; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Switched capacitor circuits belong to a class of circuits where signal processing is performed by charge redistribution among series of capacitors based on the configuration. In order to simulate the true characteristics of such circuits, the simulator should be capable of, formulating the circuit parameters based on charge redistribution rather than current-voltage relationship and, including non-idealities such as charge injection, parasitic capacitance effect, improper charge redistribution causing settling error etc. A switched capacitor circuit simulator addressing charge redistribution is presented in this paper. It works on the principle of quantifying all circuit parameters based on charge-voltage formulation which enables linearized approximation for nonlinear characteristics while evaluating the time response. The proposed simulator also incorporates nonideality of charge leakage and nonlinear capacitance. It permits piecewise constant and continuous inputs for evaluating the time response and employs numerical techniques such as Gauss elimination and LU factorization to solve equations. The linearized formulation enables shorter simulation time which otherwise requires many clock cycles and provides better convergence and accuracy. Three sample circuits are considered to validate the performance of the simulator. The entire simulator is developed in PYTHON environment taking SPICE type netlist as inputs. © 2016 IEEE.",Computer aided analysis tools; computer simulation; Modified nodal analysis (MNA); numerical techniques; switched capacitor circuits (SC),Capacitance; Computer aided analysis; Computer simulation; Computer software; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Linearization; Numerical methods; Signal processing; Simulators; Timing circuits; VLSI circuits; Current-voltage relationship; Electrical and electronic circuits; Modified nodal analysis; Nonlinear capacitance; Nonlinear characteristics; Numerical techniques; Parasitic capacitance effects; Switched capacitor circuits; Circuit simulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, a new technique for automated classification of sleep stages based on iterative filtering of EEG signals is presented. In order to perform sleep stages classification, the EEG signals are decomposed using iterative filtering method. The modes obtained from iterative filtering of EEG signal can be considered as amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) components. The discrete energy separation algorithm (DESA) is applied to the modes to determine amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions. The extracted amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions have been used to compute Poincaré plot descriptors and statistical measures. The Poincaré plot descriptors and statistical measures are applied as input features for different classifiers in order to classify sleep stages. The classifiers namely, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, C4.5 decision tree, and random forest are applied in order to classify the EEG epochs corresponding to various sleep stages. The experimental study has been performed on online available Sleep-EDF database for two-class to six-class classification of sleep stages based on EEG signals. The two-class to six-class classification problems are formulated by taking different combinations of EEG signals corresponding to various sleep stages. The comparison of the results is presented for different multi-class classification problems with the other recently proposed methods. The results show that the proposed method has provided better tenfold cross-validation classification accuracy than other existing methods. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Classifiers; Electroencephalogram signal; Iterative filtering; Sleep stages; Teager energy operator,Amplitude modulation; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Frequency modulation; Iterative methods; Nearest neighbor search; Signal processing; Sleep research; Automated classification; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram signals; Iterative filtering; Multiclass classification problems; Sleep stage; Sleep stages classifications; Teager energy operators; Biomedical signal processing,"Sharma, R.; Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology IndoreIndia; email: phd1301102007@iiti.ac.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

Gabor's uncertainty principle states that a function cannot be localized in time and frequency domain simultaneously and there exists a nonzero lower bound of 0.25 on the product of its time variance and frequency variance called timefrequency product (TFP). Using arithmetic mean (AM) geometric mean (GM) inequality, product of variances and sum of variances can be related and it can be shown that sum of variances has lower bound of one. In this paper, we compute the frequency variance of the filter from its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose an equivalent summation based discrete-time uncertainty principle which has the lower bound of one. We evaluate the performance of the proposed discrete-time timefrequency uncertainty measure in multiresolution setting and show that the proposed DFT based concentration measure generate sequences which are even more localized in time and frequency domain than that obtained from the Slepian, Ishii and Furukawa's concentration measures. The proposed design approach provides the flexibility in which the TFP can be made arbitrarily close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 by increasing the length of the filter. In the other proposed approach, the sum of the time variance and frequency variance is used to formulate a positive definite matrix to measure the timefrequency joint localization of a bandlimited function from its samples. We design the timefrequency localized bandlimited low pass scaling and band pass wavelet functions using the eigenvectors of the formulated positive definite matrix. The samples of the timefrequency localized bandlimited function are obtained from the eigenvector of the positive definite matrix corresponding to its minimum eigenvalue. The TFP of the designed bandlimited scaling and wavelet functions are close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 and 2.25 respectively. We propose a design method for timefrequency localized three-band biorthogonal linear phase (BOLP) wavelet perfect reconstruction filter bank (PRFB) wherein the free parameters can be optimized for timefrequency localization of the synthesis basis functions for the specified frequency variance of the analysis scaling function. The performance of the designed filter bank is evaluated in classification of seizure and seizure-free electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It is found that the proposed filter bank outperforms other existing methods for the classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Discrete Fourier transform; Discrete time Fourier transform; Prolate spheroid sequence; Three-band wavelet filter bank; Time-frequency localization,Bandpass filters; Design; Design for testability; Discrete Fourier transforms; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electroencephalography; Filter banks; Frequency domain analysis; Matrix algebra; Signal processing; Discrete time Fourier transform; Electroencephalogram signals; Perfect reconstruction filter banks (PRFB); Positive-definite matrices; Prolate spheroid; Time and frequency domains; Time-frequency localization; Wavelet filter banks; Biomedical signal processing,"Bhati, D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, BombayIndia; email: bhatidinesh@gmail.com",,Elsevier Inc.,10512004,,DSPRE,,English,Digital Signal Process Rev J,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026192992

Determination of quasi-periodicities in electroencephalogram (EEG) is a candidate for quantifying the changes in the depth of anesthesia (DOA). In this paper, DOA monitoring capacity of periodicities detected using PRSA was quantified by assessing EEG signals collected from 56 patients during surgery. The method is compared with sample entropy (SampEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and permutation entropy (PE). The performance of quasi-periodicities defined by deceleration capacity and acceleration capacity was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient. During the surgery, a significant difference ( $p <0.05$ ) in the quasi-periodicities was observed among three different stages under general anesthesia. There is a larger mean AUC and correlation coefficient of quasi-periodicities compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE using expert assessment of conscious level and bispectral index as the gold standard, respectively. Quasi-periodicities detected using PRSA in EEG signals are a powerful monitor of DOA and perform more accurate and robust results compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE.

The advantage of microgrid lies in its capability to work in stand-alone (island) and grid-connected mode. During the transition from grid-connected mode to island mode, there is a possibility of large voltage and frequency deviations, which is undesirable for the local loads connected to the system. These variations also build up stress on the power converter components associated with the circuitry of each of the micro-source. During the transition from stand-alone mode to grid, connected mode there is large probability of voltage and current transients. To avoid such situations, seamless mode transfer between the two working modes, an appropriate control scheme should be devised. This paper presents a control scheme wherein the micro-source inverter works in voltage control mode amid stand-alone operation and in current control mode amid grid-connected operation and switches over easily between these modes during the transition phase. The exhibited control scheme is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink and the obtained results are confirmed with hardware implementation utilizing Texas Instruments digital signal processor TMS320F28069. Simulation and hardware results establish the accomplishment of the proposed control strategy for seamless mode transfer in the microgrid. © 2017 IEEE.",Distributed generation; grid-connected mode; microgrid; seamless mode transfer; stand-alone mode,Digital signal processors; Distributed power generation; Hardware; MATLAB; Signal processing; Small power plants; Grid-connected modes; Grid-connected operation; Hardware implementations; Micro grid; Mode transfers; Power generation plants; Stand-alone modes; Voltage and current transients; Smart power grids,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

While the boom in renewable technology has provided an alternative solution for energy crisis and depleting conventional sources, their intermittent nature has raised various control and protection issues. In both AC and DC microgrids, protection issues remain similar except the fact that in DC microgrids protection becomes more critical due to absence of natural current zero. This paper proposes a novel adaptive protection strategy, which acclimates as per the system condition and configuration. The protection scheme is designed and developed for a low voltage hierarchical controlled DC microgrid. A three-layer hierarchical control stacked with a local control, an emergency control and a supervisory control is used. Local controllers control the converters associated with the source to achieve source optimization and provide local power flow control. Emergency control is realized with a microgrid protection and control supervisor (MPCS). When fault or sudden large change in load occurs, the stability of system gets critical. Quick and accurate differentiation of normal and abnormal operating conditions becomes essential. The MPCS takes over the control in such situations. The absolute values and rate of change of voltage and current measured at multiple points in the system, helps MPCS to act precisely and quickly. The supervisory control updates MPCS to adapt to the current state of the system with the help of pre-calculated modified fault levels. Texas Instruments' TMS320F28069 digital signal processors (DSP) are utilized for the implementation of proposed microgrid protection scheme. © 2017 IEEE.",Adaptive protection; DC microgrid; DSP; hierarchical control; supervisory control,Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Electric load flow; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Abnormal operating conditions; Adaptive protection; Dc micro-grid; Digital signal processors (DSP); Hierarchical control; Rate of change of voltages; Renewable energy technologies; Supervisory control; Power management,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Energy consumption is one precious component of these resources as multimedia applications consumes enormous amount of energy during communication. To achieve the goal of optimal energy conservation of a MANET, an optimal power control technique based on non-cooperative algorithm is presented in this paper. The proposed power control game uses Signal-To-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), residual energy of nodes as an efficient pricing function to deduce the utility of nodes which achieves the required Quality of Service (QoS) of MANET.

In those works, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm was used for sparse coding. In place of l0-norm minimization in the OMP algorithm, one could also use ll-norm minimization based sparse coding such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Though leading to better sparse representation, the LASSO algorithm is quite latent in contrast to the OMP. This work explores the elastic net (ENet) sparse coding algorithm in SRC based LR framework. Unlike conventional sparse coding methods, the ENet employs both l1 and l2 constraints in regularizing the sparse solutions, thus is expected to yield improved sparse coding. The experiments are performed on NIST 2007 LRE data set in closed set condition on 30 seconds duration segments. Scores are calibrated using regularized multi-class logistic regression. For language representation, the utterances are mapped to the well-known i-vector representation and applied with the within-class covariance normalization (WCCN) based session/channel compensation. The proposed ENet based LR approach is noted to significantly outperform the other LR methods developed using existing sparse and non-sparse representations. © 2017 IEEE.",,Regression analysis; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Language recognition; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Multi-class logistic regressions; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Sparse coding; Sparse representation; Sparse solutions; Within-class covariance; Codes (symbols),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Reversible watermarking and cryptography has been regarded as an adequate solution to protect the digital data from illegal access. In this paper, a novel combination of reversible watermarking and image encryption technique based on the discrete cosine transform and scrambling technique is presented. Firstly, the plain image is encrypted by scrambling technique. Then, a lossless digital watermark is embedded in the encrypted image by a discrete cosine transform. Thus an encrypted image with watermark embedded in it is obtained. Finally, the original image can be recovered by the reverse process.

To solve this discrepancy, an image conversion method is presented which changes the image structure of infrared base layer similar to another base layer.

In geographic routing, one of the neighbor of sender vehicle is selected as next forwarding vehicle to forward the message to the destination nodes. Various geographic routing protocols have been proposed in literature for efficient selection of next forwarding vehicle. However, these protocols show inadequate performance due to unique characteristics of VANETs such as high mobility, low bandwidth, and restricted movement. In this paper, a novel geographic routing (GR) protocol based on Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), namely CSO-GR is proposed that aims to efficiently find optimized position of next forwarding vehicle in highly dynamic vehicular environment. A fitness function to optimize impact of various parameters on the selection of next forwarding vehicle is suggested. Performance of the proposed protocol is assessed via simulation.

Though there are large numbers of tasks to be allocated to these resources, it becomes very necessary to efficiently assign the tasks to the resources so as to gain the maximum resource utilization. Due to enormous data available, scheduling task appears to be NP hard problem. As it becomes critical to find the exact solutions, various meta-heuristic techniques are used to attain approximate optimal solutions. In this research paper, an optimal task scheduling method is implemented. Tasks are scheduled by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm by means of max-min algorithm. The main attention is to reduce the makespan and maximize the CPU utilization. From result simulations, it has been observed that makespan value shows makespan improvement by an average of 5.01% over the existing scheduling technique which is integration of Bee colony optimization algorithm and Particle swarm optimization.

For prolonged network operational time, energy conservation is a critical issue in routing protocol design in ad-hoc wireless networks. Regardless of the energy saving issues, the conventional AODV routing protocol uses smallest hop count as the main metric to calculate the best path for routing the data packets to its destination. Major source of energy cost in a routing protocol is the energy used to transmit the data packets. For this purpose, we consider the problem of adjusting the transmission power of the nodes to an optimal power level and incorporate low power consumption strategies into the routing protocol through upward information flow cross-layer model between MAC Layer and Network Layer. Using QualNet 5.2 as the simulation tool, we evaluate the performance of our proposed energy efficient cross-layer design to AODV, which is named as Cross Layer Energy Efficient AODV (CLEE-AODV). We investigate by implementing the required changes in the route discovery process using cross-layer approach in the AODV.

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of photovoltaic module of PV system during its standstill and single-Axis tracking mode operation and also to obtain the variation of open circuit voltage of PV module with solar irradiance and temperature using the neural network approach. The open circuit voltage and the output power of photovoltaic module depend on irradiance and temperature but their relationship is nonlinear and therefore cannot be empirically evaluated. For this purpose the artificial neural network is applied for determining open circuit voltage of photovoltaic module at different operating temperature and irradiance conditions. The data values of open circuit voltage for target photovoltaic module at different operating temperature and irradiance are obtained experimentally at standstill and tracking mode operation using a microcontroller based test bed. Finally, using the input datasets obtained from test bed, the back propagation training algorithm for artificial neural network is implemented to determine the open circuit voltage of the module at a particular operating temperature and irradiance. The evaluated value at test condition is compared with practically obtained value to verify the validity of proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",artificial neural network; back propagation algorithm; microcontroller; Photovoltaic module; sensors; test bed,Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Equipment testing; Microcontrollers; Neural networks; Photovoltaic cells; Sensors; Signal processing; Solar power generation; Temperature; Artificial neural network approach; Back-propagation training algorithms; Microcontroller-based; Operating temperature; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaic systems; Single-axis tracking modes; Solar irradiances; Open circuit voltage,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Compared with its hand counterparts, skin patterns lie nearby the joints of finger surface has several unique merits. Knuckle print based biometric system is highly acceptable because these patterns do not disturb with injury and wound on the finger surface. However, geometrical and textural features have been used widely in most of the existing knuckle print recognition methods where an individual is verified by extraction of lines, creases, and shape features. This paper presents a score level fusion scheme for personal recognition using novel inner knuckle print based features i.e, knuckle distance based geometrical features, and local direction pattern based texture features. The proposed method is tested on our in-house Hand database (720 images) collected over a span of 3 months. Finally, the test and training images are compared in terms of using a K-NN classifier.

In the previous researches, migration of the task to cloud is a static process. This research paper focuses on the optimization of execution time along with the cost needed to execute the task on to the cloud. The tasks are migrated to the cloud server node dynamically after comparing the deadline time for execution with the execution time of task on mobile device and the execution time of task on the cloud server node. If the execution time of task on mobile device is less than the deadline then the task is executed on the mobile device else the task is to be migrated to the cloud server. Along with the execution time optimization, cost for migrating the tasks is being calculated separately for every task. In this way, this paper concentrates on finding tradeoff between the execution time and the cost. © 2017 IEEE.",,Cloud computing; Costs; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile devices; Signal processing; Cloud applications; Cloud servers; Large networks; Mobile nodes; Research papers; Time optimization; Distributed computer systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The algorithm works in five steps: Image Acquisition, Image Enhancement followed by Segmentation (Fuzzy C Means algorithm) then Extraction of tumor core using Area and Circularity as criteria and finally evaluating the result with Ground Truth. The mean value of dice coefficient for segmenting tumor core is 0.88. Hence segmentation of tumor core using proposed method yields efficient results. © 2017 IEEE.",Circularity; Dice Coefficien; Fuzzy C Means; Ground Truth; MRI imagery; Multispectral; Radiologists; Segmentation,Brain; Clustering algorithms; Copying; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal processing; Tumors; Circularity; Dice Coefficien; Fuzzy C mean; Ground truth; Multi-spectral; Radiologists; Image segmentation,"Mangipudi, P.; Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Sector-125, India; email: psmangipudi@amity.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In order to address this issue we have proposed two new schemes. The first one is the recursive framework, where class labels and bias fields have been estimated simultaneously. In one part of the recursion, a variable variance Adaptive Meanshift based Algorithm (VVAMS) with inherent mode seeking ability has been proposed to eliminate noise. In the other part of the recursion, class labels have been estimated using the modified possibilistic fuzzy algorithms of Jeetashree et al. [1]. The proposed scheme has successfully been tested with a large number of noisy slices from Brainweb database.

Time-frequency analysis methods are commonly used methods for analysis of non-stationary signals. In this paper, a new domain for time-frequency analysis has been proposed which has been studied for the analysis of non-stationary signals. The proposed method combines two techniques namely, iterative eigenvalue decomposition of the Hankel matrix (IEVD-HM) and the Hilbert transform (HT). The IEVD-HM technique provides a set of mono-component signals where the HT has been employed to determine amplitude envelopes and instantaneous frequencies of these mono-component signals. These amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency estimations have been used to determine the time-frequency representation. The obtained time-frequency representation has been studied for the analysis of synthetic non-stationary signals in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",Eigenvalue decomposition; Hankel matrix; Non-stationary signal analysis; Time-frequency representation,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Frequency estimation; Iterative methods; Mathematical transformations; Matrix algebra; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Eigenvalue decomposition; Hankel matrix; Instantaneous frequency; Instantaneous frequency estimation; Non-stationary signal analysis; Time frequency analysis; Time-frequency analysis methods; Time-frequency representations; Frequency domain analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this papera secure hybrid digital image watermarking scheme based on Redundant Discrete wavelet transform (RDWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Singular value decomposition (SVD) in zigzag order with Arnold transform is presented. Watermark image is scrambled by Arnold transform to boost up its secrecy and robustness. In presented scheme, a gray scale cover image is rearranged through zigzag sequence and then RDWT is implemented on this reordered cover image. After that DCT, SVD is implemented on mid and high frequency sub-bands (LH, LH, and HH) of cover image and modified the singular values of these sub-bands by embedding the scrambled gray scale watermark image. This presented scheme is more imperceptible and an enormous capacity due to the properties of RDWT and SVD. The benefit of the presented schemeis more robust and secured against various image processing attacks.

There are various key predistribution schemes (KPS in short) for wireless sensor network proposed earlier. Closest Pair KPS (CPKS) is such a scheme, which was first proposed by D. Liu and P. Ning and is used when sensor node location is known prior to deployment. In their scheme, they assign pairwise keys with a set of sensor nodes whose expected position are closest to the expected position of the sensor node.

Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) followed by Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is implemented successfully. Single channel of bandwidth 1 KHz were used allowing 8 bits of data packet transferred from the transmitter to the receiver concurrently. The rate of data transfer achieved was up to 1 kb/s. A model was designed during the work which could anticipate ultrasonic signals. The carrier frequency of data transmission was 40 KHz. The BitError Rate(BER) of the system was analyzed for different distances. The maximum distance of communication was 1 meter. Through the model designed we have transmitted image data, audio data and text data and received successfully.

MIMO provides robustness against multipath fading using spatial diversity gain, and increases data rate by spatial multiplexing gain. These gains are achieved due to the usage of several antennas. This paper presents multiuser (MU) MIMO downlink system under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and heterogeneous user signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) profile. MU MIMO essentially provides multiuser diversity gain. System capacity is increased by choosing the users experiencing better channel parameters. We have used normalized SNR based scheduler to select a user for data transmission. The outcomes of these techniques are higher data rate and transmitting long range without need of much power or bandwidth. Alamouti's space time block code (STBC) has been used in this work to increase the transmit diversity, which improves reliability of data transfer.

The Radio Frequency Identification system based on wireless communication yields a solution to inappropriate data management. The system is comprised of software integrated with hardware for management and tracking of assets by addressing the solution to the internal pilfering of assets and problems encountered during the tedious vendor invoice payment process.

The reader is placed at the checkpoints and in the drug store in the hospital environment. The Radio Frequency Identification tags attached to the assets are identified by the reader and database is updated with information stored in tags. The arrival and outgoing timing of assets are recorded for security purpose. In the case that if any assets get misplaced or purloined the timing and location of the asset will be traced.

With the increasing number of image databases consisting of a large number of images, it is challenging to extract images specific to our requirement. Therefore, it becomes necessary to design efficient search systems to query large image databases. Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) algorithms analyze the contents of an image rather than the metadata associated with it. This allows image queries to be processed in a way that extracts images from the database, having a close similarity with the query image. Conventional CBIR systems using cosine similarity have a problem of associating images having maximum content overlap, thus similar orientation and size. Therefore, images relevant to the query but having different sizes and orientation are given lower priority in their results. In this article, we propose an approach which solves this problem and attempts to return the results relevant to the query, irrespective of the contents' orientation and size, using appropriate feature extraction techniques. 32 different types of leaves form a preliminary database of 1427 images. The system performance is assessed from the query results of 16 new images belonging to each of the 32 leaf classes. Features such as leaf shape, structure, color, and texture are extracted for pattern matching. Neural network using radial basis function is used for leaf classification to aid query result retrieval. The base accuracy of the CBIR system is 96.88%. Using a simple human relevance feedback mechanism, the neural network trains itself to capture trends in existing leaf classes. As a result, the accuracy of the CBIR system increases as the database is queried. Features extracted from correctly classified leaves are added to the training set. Thus, patterns in leaves belonging to similar and dissimilar classes are captured by the neural network. This increases the robustness of the CBIR to establish maximum possible precision and recall rates along with accurate retrieval of orientation and size varying results. © 2017 IEEE.",content-based image retrieval; eigen transformation; morphological processing; neural networks; radial basis function; rotational invariance; structural decomposition,Color matching; Content based retrieval; Functions; Image processing; Image retrieval; Imaging techniques; Neural networks; Pattern matching; Query languages; Query processing; Radial basis function networks; Signal processing; Content based image retrieval; eigen transformation; Morphological processing; Radial basis functions; Rotational invariances; Structural decomposition; Search engines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In order to actualize the ideal frequency response, fractional derivative constraints are imposed such that there is no deviation in fractional derivative of designed frequency response at prescribed frequency points. The divergence in designed frequency response and ideal frequency response is curtailed using conventional least square design method along with Lagrange multiplier to attain closed loop filter coefficients.

In mobile communications, the time varying nature of signals and noise makes this issue more challenging. Among conventional signal processing techniques, finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) structures provide their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Though gamma filters in FIR and IIR forms have been suggested for noise cancellation in speech, it is bottlenecked due to issue such as longer convergence time, delay generation and inability to provide phase variation compensation. This paper presents certain techniques to overcome this issue. Firstly, a modified gamma filter with a feedback structure is used to improve MSE convergence and provide better phase variation correction. The second method uses a transfer function approach for phase correction of the filtered signal. Experiments show that the MSE and phase difference(in degree) between the filtered signal and the desired signal are lower for the proposed structure than the MSE and phase difference values obtained for the FIR filter and original gamma filter structure. Thus the suggested techniques have been found to be more reliable and efficient. © 2017 IEEE.",FIR(Finite Impulse Response); IIR(Infinite Impulse Response); LMS(Least Mean Square); MSE(Mean Square Error),Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; FIR filters; IIR filters; Impulse response; Mean square error; Spurious signal noise; Feedback structure; Finite-impulse response; Infinite impulse response; Least mean squares; Mobile communications; MSE(Mean Square Error); Noise cancellation; Signal processing technique; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

But like other wireless networks WSN is also prone to adversary interventions. So the researchers are addressing this issue to make routing protocols secure for communication. But due to the severe resource constraints on sensor nodes like limited battery life and limited storage capacity prevents the traditional complex security mechanisms to be employed on the sensor nodes. In this paper we propose a new routing algorithm called Secure Energy Aware Multipath Routing with Key Management (SEAM-KM) in Wireless Sensor Network. This protocol focuses on using a base station as the central control block for all kinds of computation like shortest path selection, routing table generation, Updating the routing table and distribution of pair wise keys among the sensor nodes and the base station. Leaving the energy consuming computations to be performed by the base station, the lifetime of the sensor nodes can be prolonged. Moreover distribution of pair wise keys among sensor nodes provides security among sensor nodes and also increases the resilience of the network. This protocol is resistive to some of the specific attacks which rely on forming attractive routes to lure the sensor nodes to communicate through the already compromised nodes. © 2017 IEEE.",Dijkstra's algorithm; Energy efficiency; Key Management; Multipath routing; Security,Base stations; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Network security; Power management; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; Critical environment; Dijkstra's algorithms; Key management; Multi path routing; Resource Constraint; Security; Security mechanism; Power management (telecommunication),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Dictionary learning algorithms have made it possible to engineer data adaptive dictionaries which have promising applications in image compression and image enhancement. The most common sparse dictionary learning algorithms use the techniques of matching pursuit and K-SVD iteratively for sparse coding and dictionary learning respectively. While this technique produces good results, it requires a large number of iterations to converge to an optimal solution. In this article, we propose a closed form convex optimization technique for both sparse coding and dictionary learning. The approach results in providing the best possible dictionary and the sparsest representation resulting in minimum reconstruction error which in turn results in compression. It is clearly seen from the results that the proposed algorithm provides much better reconstruction results than conventional sparse dictionary techniques for a fixed number of iterations. Depending upon the amount of details present in the image, the proposed algorithm is seen to reach the optimal solution with significantly lower number of iterations. Consequently low mean squared error is obtained using the proposed algorithm. We demonstrate the results with standard image. © 2017 IEEE.",convex optimization; dictionary learning; image compression; normal equation; sparse coding,Codes (symbols); Convex optimization; Image coding; Image enhancement; Image processing; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Optimal systems; Optimization; Signal processing; Convex optimization techniques; Dictionary learning; Dictionary learning algorithms; Normal equations; Over-complete dictionaries; Reconstruction error; Sparse coding; Sparse representation; Image compression,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

For this purpose, input image is uniformly subdivided into several non-overlapping equal sized regions. A good estimation has been achieved by classifying these regions into three groups namely corner regions, boarder regions as well as inner regions. Further, separate histogram equalization can be performed, followed by individual region's contextual clipping so that unwanted domination of high frequency bins over other bins can be avoided. Later on, a non-linear transformational mapping has been imposed by suitable gamma-correction using required gamma value-set, which itself is derived by cumulative distribution of the intensity values in adaptively equalized histogram. The proposed methodology clearly outperforms other state-of-The-Art methods in terms of complexity as well as quantitative and qualitative performance; and hence, can be appreciably used for a wide and dynamic range of image-database which belongs to various domains ranging from biomedical images to remotely sensed satellite images. © 2017 IEEE.",,Equalizers; Graphic methods; Mathematical transformations; Signal processing; Biomedical images; Cumulative distribution; Gamma correction; High frequency HF; Histogram equalizations; Intrinsic features; State-of-the-art methods; Statistical approach; Image enhancement,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

EEG data was taken on 5 naïve listeners while they listened to two ragas-Bahar and Mia ki Malhar which are conventionally known to portray contrast emotions. The EEG data were analyzed with the help of two robust non-linear tools viz. Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). A comparative study of the Hurst Exponents obtained from the two methods have been shown which shows that DFA provides more rigorous results compared to AFA when it comes to the scaling analysis of bio-signal data.

The spectral floor parameter is optimized in the multi-band spectral subtraction technique as it controls the amount of residual noise estimation to avoid crossing the lower bound. The enhanced dysarthric speech is compared with standard enhancement techniques such as Boll's spectral subtraction, multi-band subtraction and Kalman filtering using segmental signal-To-noise ratio, log spectral distortion, mel cepstral distortion and perceptual scores. Further, the improved speech is represented using complex cepstrum based features, and trained using general regression based classier.

The primary objective is to perform lossy and perceptually transparent compression on the sounds of various Indian musical instruments. Firstly, the original sound signal is decomposed into wavelet packets using an optimal wavelet basis. Wavelet packets are then run through psychoacoustic model in wavelet domain to determine auditory masking level for thresholding, which in turn is used to perform thresholding of wavelet coefficients in respective sub-bands. Further, audio signal coefficients are partitioned into frames which overlap in such a way that each block gets 512 samples and windowed using a hanning window with 1/16 frame overlap. Secondly, MDCT is applied to each block to de-correlate the spectral information. Removal of spectral redundancy is achieved by compressing the subordinate components more than the dominant components. The resulting signal is quantized with variable number of bits, which are determined based on the results of the psychoacoustic model in FFT domain. This technique provides an efficient way to exploit key strengths of both DWPT and MDCT. © 2017 IEEE.",modified discrete cosine transform; peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR); percentage root mean square difference (PRD); psychoacoustic model; thresholding,Acoustics; Discrete cosine transforms; Image coding; Musical instruments; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet analysis; Modified discrete cosine transforms; Peak signal to noise ratio; Percentage root-mean-square differences; Psychoacoustic model; Thresholding; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

While many works in the literature discuss the impact of buffer organization on the performance in terms of latency, in this work we evaluate the impact of buffer organization with area and power consumption in the router. In this experimental study, we implement 36 different router architectures with different flit sizes, input port and crossbar configurations. All these router architectures are implemented, synthesized and validated on the 28nm Xilinx Kintex KC705 FPGA hardware for comparison. We have also synthesized these routers using the 1P8M UMC65nm standard cell technology on Cadence ASIC flow. We report that for the same number of buffers, the dynamic power and area can vary by up to 67% based on the configuration.

Modified Covariance, Burg, and/or Yule-Walker methods are used to calculate spectral densities. Individual weights from such methods are computed to infer a single electrode characteristic. Similar procedure is repeated for each electrode for concluding overall neurophysiological health status. Experimental results thus obtained are quite encouraging. © 2017 IEEE.",Autoregressive; BCI; EEG; EMG; Neurophysiological Signal Analysis; Spectrum Estimation,Brain computer interface; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Interfaces (computer); Neurophysiology; Signal processing; Spectral density; Spectrum analysis; Auto-regressive; Brain-computer interfacing; Nonparametric methods; Parametric method; Signal interpretation; Single electrodes; Spectrum estimation; Yule-Walker methods; Signal analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Every single day, we hear of emergency situations in flights like fires, birdstrikes, diversions, engine failures and emergency landings etc. Across the globe, Air Traffic Controllers are constantly monitoring the in-flight situation based on inputs from the pilots and advicing them on possible diversions or measures to take so as to avoid any danger to the lifes of passengers and the cabin crew. Though, the manual monitoring of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Conversations is efficient and reliable, but still, it may be subject to human biass and glitches. Also, post-flight monitoring is difficult because there is no such automatic measure for arriving at the conclusion, whether the flight faced an emergency or not. Audio Signal Processing finds an interesting use in this case. By extracting some crucial features from an audio conversation, one can proceed towards the classification once the feautres seem good and efficient. The paper mainly focusses on extracting these features critical to ATC analysis. In the future, with availablity of good database, the paper can be expanded to classify the conversations using Machine Learning techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",Energy; Feature Extraction; MFCC; Support Vector Machine; Volume; Zero Crossing Rate,Air navigation; Air transportation; Audio signal processing; Aviation; Classification (of information); Control towers; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Patient monitoring; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Traffic control; Traffic signals; Air traffic control (ATC); Air traffic controller; Emergency situation; Energy; Machine learning techniques; MFCC; Volume; Zero crossing rate; Air traffic control,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, an algorithm to detect multiple targets in OFDM-RADAR environment is proposed. The detection is carried out by utilizing the fact that the problem of detecting targets in OFDM-RADAR environment is similar to that of the problem of detecting spectral components from the noisy observations of a complex exponential function. Further, a maximum likelihood estimator is proposed to estimate range and velocity of multiple targets. Performance of the proposed estimator is quantified by the use of two statistical parameters. From simulations, we confirm superior performance of the proposed detector and estimator for multiple target detection. © 2017 IEEE.",,Exponential functions; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radar; Radar signal processing; Radar systems; Signal processing; Complex exponential functions; Detecting target; Maximum likelihood estimator; Multiple targets; Multiple-target detections; Noisy observations; Spectral components; Statistical parameters; Radar target recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Due to unobtrusive nature of sensor placement at wrist, smartwatches and wrist based fitness bands have gained popularity. However, any movement of the wrist along with frequent loose contacts significantly corrupts the PPG signal. Reliable peak detection from the corrupted PPG signal is essential for any further processing, as many physiological quantities such as heart rate variability (HRV) depends on the peak-to-peak distances in the PPG signal, known as the RR Series. This paper attempts to provide a robust algorithm for peak detection in noise & motion artefact corrupted PPG signals. The algorithm consists of steps to remove the baseline drift in the PPG signal using wavelet filtering and trend removal and subsequent peak detection using autcorrelation for each pseudo-periodic segment of the signal. The validation of the method is done by comparing the PPG peaks detected by the algorithm with RR series extracted from simultaneously captured ECG signal. © 2017 IEEE.",,"algorithm; heart rate; motion; photoelectric plethysmography; signal processing; Algorithms; Heart Rate; Motion; Photoplethysmography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1557170X,9.78151E+12,,29059822,English,Proc.

Analysis of PCG signal has the potential to detect abnormal cardiac condition. However, the presence of noise and motion artifacts in PCG hinders the accuracy of clinical event detection. Thus, noise detection and elimination are crucial to ensure accurate clinical analysis. In this paper, we present a robust denoising technique, Proclean that precisely detects the noisy PCG signal through pattern recognition, and statistical learning. We propose a novel self-discriminant learner that ensures to obtain distinct feature set to distinguish clean and noisy PCG signals without human-in-loop. We demonstrate that our proposed denoising leads to higher accuracy in subsequent clinical analytics for medical investigation. Our extensive experimentations with publicly available MIT-Physionet datasets show that we achieve more than 85% accuracy for noisy PCG signal detection.

It is well known that the ECG signals get corrupted by a number of noises during the recording process. Especially, during wireless ECG recording and ambulatory patient monitoring, the signal gets corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Over the years, several techniques have been proposed for ECG denoising. Among those, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm are noted to be quite effective. Further, the NLM-based approach is better in retaining the morphological characteristics in comparison to the EMD. Consequently, the two approaches are effectively combined in this paper so that each one complements the other. In the proposed approach, the noisy ECG signal is first preprocessed using the NLM algorithm. This is followed by decomposition of the partially denoised output through M-EMD. The decomposed components are suitably thresholded and then reconstructed to obtain the final denoised signal. This largely addresses the issue of under-averaged regions noted in the case of NLM-based denoising. Furthermore, the proposed approach is noted to be superior to the other existing techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",AWGN; ECG denoising; Modified EMD; NLM; Thresholding,"algorithm; electrocardiography; human; normal distribution; signal noise ratio; signal processing; Algorithms; Electrocardiography; Humans; Normal Distribution; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1557170X,9.78151E+12,,29060518,English,Proc.

The monitoring of degradation in bearings becomes of great concern for averting the sudden machinery breakdown. In this study, a novel method for bearing performance degradation assessment (PDA) based on an amalgamation of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and k-medoids clustering is encouraged. The fault features are extracted from the bearing signals using the EMD process. The extracted features are then subjected to k-medoids based clustering for obtaining the normal state and failure state cluster centres. A confidence value (CV) curve based on dissimilarity of the test data object to the normal state is obtained and employed as the degradation indicator for assessing the health of bearings. The proposed outlook is applied on the vibration signals collected in run-to-failure tests of bearings to assess its effectiveness in bearing PDA. To validate the superiority of the suggested approach, it is compared with commonly used time-domain features RMS and kurtosis, well-known fault diagnosis method envelope analysis (EA) and existing PDA classifiers i.e. self-organizing maps (SOM) and Fuzzy c-means (FCM). The results demonstrate that the recommended method outperforms the time-domain features, SOM and FCM based PDA in detecting the early stage degradation more precisely. Moreover, EA can be used as an accompanying method to confirm the early stage defect detected by the proposed bearing PDA approach. The study shows the potential application of k-medoids clustering as an effective tool for PDA of bearings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bearings; Empirical mode decomposition; k-medoids clustering; Performance degradation assessment,Bearings (structural); Conformal mapping; Fault detection; Machinery; Metals; Self organizing maps; Signal processing; Bearing performance; Degradation indicators; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Fault diagnosis method; K-medoids clustering; Machinery breakdown; Performance degradation assessment; Time domain features; Time domain analysis,"Upadhyay, S.H.email: shumefme@iitr.ac.in",,Academic Press,8883270,,MSSPE,,English,Mech Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015302947

Present systems employ algorithms that are based on various states of head, in the movement. These state based systems perform well in many cases, but lacks the ability for classification of the trajectory of head movement. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a new real-time head movement classification system from video streams based on the trajectory. This system is based on facial landmark coordinates and independent component analysis (ICA), which is a relatively new signal processing tool that reveals hidden patterns in the data. We have used a single front camera to capture the video streams and employ an active appearance model based system for finding the facial landmark points. Then ICA is carried out on these landmark points/coordinates, resulting in independent components (ICs). These ICs are compared with reference ICs and similarity values obtained were used for classification of the head movement by the neural network classifier. Our system achieved 98 % classification accuracy and it is capable of precise classification of head movements such as left, right, up and down.

It has become a challenge to the researchers to identify the segments within the DNA sequence that involved in protein synthesis and called coding region of gene. The methods are generally used to identify the segment that relies on period-3 property of genes. This period-3 property easily can be identified by digital signal processing with great accuracy. Prior to DSP application in gene prediction a conversion rule is required which converts symbolic DNA (ATCGTC) sequence into numerical representations. Accuracy of gene prediction depends on mapping rule. The effectiveness of mapping rule depends on the application area of genomics. Some mapping rule works well in gene prediction may not performed good in genetic disease prediction. Most of the available conversion rules are fixed mapping technique. In this paper a new conversion rule is proposed prior to DSP application and a polyphase filter is used to suppress the noise in the DNA spectrum.

These faults, which are of multiple type, are compounded in nature. Vibration analysis of multimedia signals is one of the most effective techniques for the health monitoring of these bearings. A compound fault signal usually consists of multiple characteristic signals and strong confusion noise, which makes it a tough task to separate weak fault signals from them. To resolve the compound fault diagnosis problem of rolling bearings byseparation of multimedia signals (obtained from acoustic or acceleration sensors), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method along with some classifier (like independent component analysis (ICA) technique) has been used to some degree of success. But, they are not found capable of detecting difficult faults existing on small balls of the bearing. In order to solve this problem, we are going to propose a new method based on use of Combined Mode Functions (CMF) for selecting the intrinsic mode functions(IMFs) instead of the maximum cross correlation coefficient based EEMD technique, sandwiched with, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), which are deep neural nets, used as fault classifiers. This composite CNN-CMF-EEMD methodovercomes the deficiencies of other approaches, such as the inability to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues and fine compound faults like those occurring on small balls of the bearing. The difficult compound faults can be separated effectively by executing CNN-CMF-EEMD method, which makes the fault features more easily extracted and more clearly identified. Experimental results reinforce the effectiveness of using CNN-CMF--EEMD technique for fine compound faults. A comparison of CNN-CMF-EEMD with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based ANN-CMF-EEMD shows the capability of CNN as a powerful classifier in the domain of compound fault features of rolling bearing. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Artificial neural networks; Combined mode functions; Compound faults; Convolution neural network; Ensemble empirical mode distribution; Independent component analysis; Intrinsic mode functions; Multimedia signals,Bearings (machine parts); Complex networks; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Failure analysis; Functions; Independent component analysis; Neural networks; Roller bearings; Signal processing; Structures (built objects); Vibration analysis; Compound faults; Convolution neural network; Intrinsic Mode functions; Mode distribution; Mode functions; Multimedia signals; Fault detection,"Singh, S.K.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)India; email: sandipks.rs.mec15@itbhu.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011711428

Since the wired network and wireless network use the different technologies, there is a necessity of developing new protocols or redesigning of existing protocols. Transmission Control Protocol is redesigned to achieve the reliable and effective communication in the heterogeneous wired-wireless network. The basic assumption made in Transmission Control Protocol is that the packet losses are caused by the network congestion but in case of wireless network, the packet losses may be due to temporary link failure, high Bit-Error-Rate etc. Hence the congestion avoidance algorithm of Transmission Control Protocol needs to be redesigned to cope with heterogeneous wired-wireless network. Therefore in this paper, we propose a congestion avoidance algorithm which differentiates the cause of packet losses. The essential components of proposed algorithm are round-trip-time estimation, backlogged packet estimation, channel status notification, loss differentiation algorithm and congestion window control. A round-trip-time estimation using ARIMA(2,1,1) model is proposed in this paper which estimates the sudden changes in the round trip time. It helps us to estimate the backlogged packet and thereby differentiating the congestive packet loss from non-congestive packet loss. In addition, we use the received signal strength of wireless receiver to differentiate the packet losses.

Effortless accessibility of these data attracts the researchers from diverse disciplines to process them for the benefit of the society. In the field of signal processing, a new area of research has been introduced namely genomic signal processing (GSP). GSP basically processes genes, proteins and DNA sequences using various signal processing methodologies to extract the information hidden in it. As some genetic abnormalities turn into cancer diseases, proper understanding and analysis of genes and proteins may lead to a new horizon in cancer genomic study. In genomic signal processing, exact identification and classification of diseased gene is a great challenge to the researchers. Hence in the present paper, the crucial job of gene identification and classification is attempted. As a solution to this problem, statistical methods like entropy estimation and mutual information calculation is adopted along with DSP technique. Rayleigh distribution of estimated entropy of gene is treated as identifier of healthy and cancerous Homo sapiens. Once the cancer genes are identified, mutual information estimator based on their minimum entropy is used as classifier to detect different types of cancer genes. The present algorithms are successfully tested on several healthy and cancerous prostate, breast and colon genes collected from NCBI genbank. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Biodiversity; Classification (of information); Diseases; DNA sequences; Entropy; Genes; Proteins; Entropy estimation; Gene identification; Genetic abnormality; Genomic-signal-processing; Microarray technologies; Mutual information calculations; Mutual informations; Rayleigh distributions; Signal processing,"Barman, S.; Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, University of CalcuttaIndia; email: barmanmandal@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,9467076,,,,English,Microsyst Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978035577

This method is intended to provide remedies from the shortcomings of the technique proposed by Lin et al. (2008), and invalidates the effect of intentional attacks recently designed by Meerwald et al. (2009). The algorithm incorporates three level image decomposition using lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and low-pass subband is utilized for data hiding purpose. Watermark bits are embedded into the blocks of non-overlapped wavelet coefficients of the cover image by quantizing the two maximum coefficients of the corresponding block. In watermark extraction process, the DSR is applied by performing the tuning operation on coefficient blocks of attacked watermarked image. It is a parameter dependent approach that enhances the performance of watermark extraction, where the parameters of DSR inherently depend on the image properties such as standard deviation or variance. As far as security is concerned, the randomization of wavelet coefficients, blocks, and watermark bits helps the framework to be more secure. The proposed technique is also examined against multiple watermarking attack and successfully proves its authenticity and ownership. Comparison of the proposed technique with recent techniques shows remarkable improvement in terms of robustness and security against various intentional, signal processing, and geometrical attacks. © 2017 The Franklin Institute",,Extraction; Magnetic resonance; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Tuning; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Dynamic stochastic resonances; Geometrical attacks; Lifting wavelet transforms; Multiple watermarking; Parameter dependents; Watermark extraction; Watermark extraction process; Wavelet coefficients; Image processing,"Jha, R.K.; Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering CollegeIndia; email: jharajib@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,160032,,JFINA,,English,J Franklin Inst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026797528

In recent years, although wideband DIs and DDs have been designed using metaheuristic optimization techniques such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO), these algorithms lead to sub-optimal solutions because of stagnation and premature convergence. HS algorithm, however, promises an enhanced frequency response for DIs and DDs because of the better exploration and exploitation of the search space. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of HS-based designs as compared with three well-known benchmark evolutionary optimization algorithms, namely real coded genetic algorithm (RGA), PSO, and differential evolution (DE) based designs by yielding the least values of different magnitude response error metrics. Parametric and non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests are also conducted to compare the consistency in the performance of HS-based DIs and DDs with those of the designs based on RGA, PSO, and DE.

However, PCG is highly susceptible to noise, and extra sound called murmur may also be present in the PCG signal due to pathology. These components cause difficulties in the segmentation and therefore, segmentation is often preceded by the denoising of the PCG signal to emphasize the fundamental heart sounds S1 and S2, by removing these unwanted components. For the denoising of the PCG signal, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based algorithms have shown good performance because such algorithms suppress in-band noise besides the out-of-band noise. Selection of threshold value and threshold function significantly affects the performance of these algorithms. In this paper, for threshold value estimation, an adaptive method based on statistical parameters of the given PCG signal is proposed. The statistical parameters are found to be highly effective for this purpose. We also propose a new threshold function, non-linear mid function, to address the issues of SNR and transients in the existing threshold functions, soft and hard. The proposed method is applied on a large number of PCG signals with additive white Gaussian noise, red noise, and pink noise. The Performance of the proposed method is also evaluated on the PCG signals recorded in real-life noisy scenarios and signals with murmur sound. The obtained results show that the proposed method is significantly superior to the competitive algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Discrete wavelet transform; Heart sound signal; Phonocardiography; Thresholding; Wavelet denoising,Acoustic noise; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Gaussian noise (electronic); Phonocardiography; Signal denoising; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; White noise; Adaptive thresholding; Additive White Gaussian noise; Cardio-vascular disease; Competitive algorithms; Heart sound signal; Statistical parameters; Thresholding; Wavelet denoising; Biomedical signal processing; aortic regurgitation; aortic stenosis; Article; cardiovascular disease assessment; decomposition; heart cycle; heart murmur; heart sound; human; methodology; mitral valve prolapse; mitral valve regurgitation; mitral valve stenosis; noise; phonocardiography; priority journal; process optimization; pulmonary valve stenosis; signal noise ratio; signal processing; tricuspid valve regurgitation; tricuspid valve stenosis; wavelet analysis,"Jain, P.K.; IIT Jodhpur, 1106, Academic Block-1, Old Residency Road, India; email: puneetjain@iitj.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

The capability of detection depends upon soil moisture, target characteristics and subsurface characteristics, which are mainly responsible for contaminating the GPR images with clutter. Researchers earlier have used averaging, mean, median, Eigen values, etc. for subtracting the background from GPR images. To analyse the background subtraction or clutter reduction problems, in this paper, we have experimentally reviewed background subtraction techniques with or without target conditions to enhance the target detection under variable soil moisture content. Indigenously developed GPR has been used to collect the data for different soil conditions and several background subtraction signal processing techniques were critically reviewed like, mean, median, singular value decomposition (SVD), principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and training methods. The signal to clutter ratio (SCR) measurement has been used for performance evaluation of each technique. The relative merits and demerits of each technique has also been analysed. The background subtraction techniques have been appliedto experimental GPR data and it is observed that in comparison of mean, SVD, median, ICA, PCA, the training method shows the highest SCR with buried target.

For designing of an efficient classification framework 480 MLO view digitized screen film mammographic images are taken from DDSM dataset. The ROIs of fixed size i.e. 128 × 128 pixels are cropped from the center area of the breast (i.e. the area where glandular ducts are prominent). A total of 292 texture features based on statistical methods, signal processing based methods and transform domain based methods are computed for each ROI. The computed feature vector is subjected to PCA for dimensionality reduction. The reduced feature space is fed to the classification module. In this work 4-class breast density classification has been conducted using hierarchical framework where the first classifier is used to classify an unknown test ROI into B-I/other class. If the test ROI is predicted as other class, it is inputted to second classifier for the classification into B-II/dense class. If the test ROI is predicted as belonging to dense class, it is inputted to classifier for the classification into B-III/B-IV class. In this work five hierarchical classifiers designs consisting of 3 PCA-kNN, 3 PCA-PNN, 3 PCA-ANN, 3 PCA-NFC and 3 PCA-SVM classifiers has been proposed. The obtained maximum OCA value is 80.4% using PCA-NFC in hierarchical approach. Further, the best performing individual classifiers are clubbed together in a hierarchical framework to design hybrid hierarchical framework for classification of breast density using digitized screen film mammograms. The proposed hybrid hierarchical framework yields the OCA value of 84.1%.

The variation of the coupling terms for change in load torque is considered as the performance measure.

It is an ocular disorder caused by increased fluid pressure within the eye. The clinical methods available for the diagnosis of glaucoma require skilled supervision. They are manual, time consuming, and out of reach of common people. Hence, there is a need for an automated glaucoma diagnosis system for mass screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for an automated diagnosis of glaucoma using digital fundus images. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) method is used in an iterative manner for image decomposition. Various features namely, Kapoor entropy, Renyi entropy, Yager entropy, and fractal dimensions are extracted from VMD components.

This would be much more powerful and general purpose when combined with other existing well-known algorithmic solutions that exist for conventional computing architectures using a suitable ALU. Thus, a specifically designed DNA Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that can address operations suitable for both domains can mitigate the gap between these two. An ALU must be able to perform all possible logic operations, including NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and XNOR; compare, shift etc., integer and floating point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In this paper, design of an ALU has been proposed using sticker-based DNA model with experimental feasibility analysis. Novelties of this paper may be in manifold. First, the integer arithmetic operations performed here are 2s complement arithmetic, and the floating point operations follow the IEEE 754 floating point format, resembling closely to a conventional ALU. Also, the output of each operation can be reused for any next operation. So any algorithm or program logic that users can think of can be implemented directly on the DNA computer without any modification. Second, once the basic operations of sticker model can be automated, the implementations proposed in this paper become highly suitable to design a fully automated ALU. Third, proposed approaches are easy to implement. Finally, these approaches can work on sufficiently large binary numbers. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",DNA ALU; DNA computing; sticker model,"Bioinformatics; Calculations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Digital arithmetic; DNA; Electron tubes; Energy efficiency; Logic circuits; Algorithm design and analysis; Computational model; DNA-computing; Parallel processing; Search problem; Sticker models; Computer architecture; DNA; biological model; chemical model; chemistry; computer aided design; computer simulation; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; feasibility study; molecular computer; molecular model; signal processing; ultrastructure; Computer Simulation; Computer-Aided Design; Computers, Molecular; DNA; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Feasibility Studies; Models, Chemical; Models, Genetic; Models, Molecular; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Ghosal, P.; Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: p_ghosal@it.iiests.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15361241,,,28715334,English,IEEE Trans.

QRS detection is complicated by factors like varying QRS morphologies, noise, artefacts and interference from tall and pointed P- and T-waves. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for QRS detection by preprocessing the ECG using weighted total variation (WTV) denoising. A local estimate of noise in the signal block under consideration is used to determine the regularization parameter in WTV minimization, which determines the amount of smoothing applied. This makes the denoising locally adaptive. The weights are chosen so as to give preference to preservation of QRS complexes over P- and T-waves while smoothing. Thus, the technique can simultaneously reduce the higher frequency noise as well as the lower frequency interference from P- and T-waves, in spite of the fact that they have overlapping spectra with the QRS complexes. The proposed method is evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and gives improved detection accuracy over established and state-of-the-art techniques. The technique has low computational load, therefore, it can be used for fast offline QRS detection in long duration ECG records, as well as real-time QRS detection in block-by-block processing mode. The average values of sensitivity, positive predictivity and detection error rate are 99.90%, 99.88% and 0.23%, for the offline implementation, respectively, and 99.86%, 99.85% and 0.29%, for the real-time mode, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electrocardiogram; QRS detection; Teager-Kaiser energy; Weighted total variation minimization,"Complexation; Electrocardiography; Image denoising; Detection error rate; Low computational loads; QRS complex detection; QRS detection; Regularization parameters; State-of-the-art techniques; Teager-Kaiser energy; Weighted total variations; Biomedical signal processing; adult; aged; Article; artifact; cardiac patient; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; false positive result; heart arrhythmia; heart electrophysiology; human; P wave; priority journal; QRS amplitude; QRS complex; signal noise ratio; signal transduction; T wave; weighted total variation; electrocardiography; pathophysiology; procedures; signal processing; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Electrocardiography; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Sharma, T.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: tanushreesharma1@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,28601028,English,Comput.

Hence, the early detection of cardiac diseases based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is important for delivering appropriate and timely treatment to the heart patients and it is increasing the heart patients survival. Recent trends in clinical decision making systems appeal automation in ECG signal processing and beat classification. Automatic beat classification is a significant method to support clinical specialists to categorize arrhythmia signals in ECG recording. The main objective of this paper is to construct novel automatic classification system for analysis of ECG signal and decision making purposes. The proposed method involves three main parts: De-noising, feature extraction and classification. Initially, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied before classification for signal De-noising and feature extraction. In this work, neighborhood rough set is applied to classify the ECG signals into normal and four abnormal heart beats. The presence of neighborhood rough set classification algorithm (NRSC) produces very exciting recognition and classification abilities through a wide range of biomedical signal processing. The experimental analysis of the proposed NRSC algorithm is compared with the multi-layered perceptron, decision table, Naïve Bayes and J48 classification algorithms. Here, the performance of classification algorithms has been evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false predictive value, Matthewss correlation coefficients, F-measure, FolkeMallows Index and Kulcznski Index.

In this paper, we propose two feature extraction approaches to classify five types of heartbeats: normal, premature ventricular contraction, atrial premature contraction, left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block. In the first approach, ECG beats are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Later four parameters, namely the sample entropy, coefficient of variation, singular values, and band power of IMFs are extracted as features. In the second approach, the same features are computed from IMFs extracted using an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm. The features obtained from the two approaches are independently fed to the sequential minimal optimization-support vector machine (SMO-SVM) for classification. We used two arrhythmia databases for our evaluation: MIT-BIH and INCART. We compare the proposed approaches with existing methods using the performance measures given by the average values of (i) specificity, (ii) sensitivity, and (iii) accuracy. The first approach demonstrates significant performance with 98.01% sensitivity, 99.49% specificity, and 99.20% accuracy for the MIT-BIH database and 95.15% sensitivity, 98.37% specificity, and 97.57% accuracy for the INCART database. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Arrhythmia; Classification; ECG signal; Empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; SMO-SVM,Classification (of information); Database systems; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Feature extraction; Optimization; Signal processing; Arrhythmia; ECG signals; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; SMO-SVM; Support vector machines; Article; decomposition; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; electroencephalography; entropy; heart beat; heart left bundle branch block; heart right bundle branch block; heart ventricle extrasystole; nonlinear system; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; supraventricular premature beat; electrocardiography; heart rate; human; procedures; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Nonlinear Dynamics; Support Vector Machine,"Rajesh, K.N.V.P.S.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: kandala.rajesh2014@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,28624712,English,Comput.

It offers high quality services at the cost of increased hardware and signal processing complexity. Antenna selection is one of the suitable solutions to overcome the limitations of MIMO scheme. Antenna selection schemes are becoming very popular in the recent wireless techniques like massive MIMO, cognitive radio, multi-hop relay networks (MHR) and wireless local area networks. Instead of using all the available antennas for transmission and reception, antenna selection schemes select good antennas based on the channel state information (CSI). To attain the full benefits of transmitter and joint antenna selection schemes, accurate CSI is required at the transmitter side. The non-zero feedback delay and time varying channel conditions, make the CSI available at the transmitter outdated, which also affects the antenna selection process. In this work, we have derived the closed form average symbol error rate (SER) expression of M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) modulation, for three different antenna selection schemes, by considering the effect of delayed CSI. All these derived expressions are the function of correlation between CSI at the receiver and delayed CSI at the transmitter. The simulation results show that the antenna selection gain decreases with the decrease in correlation. It is also observed that scheme 1 based antenna selection is optimal under delayed CSI conditions, for different constellations and more suited for future wireless standards. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Antenna selection; Delayed CSI; M-PSK; Multi input single output (MISO); SER,Antennas; Channel capacity; Cognitive radio; Communication channels (information theory); Complex networks; MIMO systems; Phase shift; Phase shift keying; Signal processing; Transmitters; Antenna selection; Average symbol error rate (SER); Delayed CSI; M-ary phase shift keying; Multi input multi output; Multi input single outputs; Multi-hop relay networks; Time-varying channel conditions; Channel state information,"Arthi, M.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: arthimdas@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011545382

Dynamic associativity management (DAM) is a technique to allow the heavily used sets to distribute their load among the lightly used sets thus improving the overall utilization of the cache. CMP-SVR is a previously proposed DAM based technique, where each set is divided into two sections: normal storage (NT) and reserve storage (RT). Some number of ways (25 to 50 percent) from each set are reserved for RT and the remaining ways belong to NT. The sets are divided into groups called fellow-groups and a set can use the reserve-ways of its fellow sets to increase its associativity during execution. Though CMP-SVR improves performance the formation of its fellow-groups is static: once created it never changes. It has been observed that some fellow-groups have more number of heavily used sets than the other fellow-groups. As a result the cache loads are not uniformly distributed among the fellow-groups. Also the behavior of sets changes dynamically: a lightly used set may become heavily used after a number of execution cycles. This paper studies the behavior of each set in detail and proposes a DAM based technique which improves the performance compared to other DAM based techniques. The proposed technique called FS-DAM dynamically creates fellow-groups based on the current set loads ensuring that the heavily used sets are evenly distributed among all the fellow-groups. Such distribution increases the utilization of the cache and hence improves performance. Full system simulation shows an average of 6.62 and 16.74 percent improvements, in FS-DAM as compared to CMP-SVR, in terms of CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) and MPKI (Miss Per Thousand Instructions) respectively. Comparing with Z-Cache the improvements are 6.21 percent (CPI) and 14.65 percent (MPKI). The proposed policy also shows better performance over V-Way and SBC. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",CMP-SVR; DAM; NUCA; V-way; victim retention,Hardware; Signal processing; CMP-SVR; Cycles per instructions; Execution cycles; Full-system simulation; Non-uniform distribution; NUCA; Runtime adaptation; victim retention; Dams,,,IEEE Computer Society,10459219,,ITDSE,,English,IEEE Trans Parallel Distrib Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029127553

In order to determine IFF, the Hilbert transform and smoothing operation have been applied on the obtained FFC.

We have fused Electroencephalogram (EEG) waves of user and corresponding global textual comments of the video to understand the user's preference more precisely. In our framework, the users were asked to watch the video-advertisement and simultaneously EEG signals were recorded. Valence scores were obtained using self-report for each video. A higher valence corresponds to intrinsic attractiveness of the user. Furthermore, the multimedia data that comprised of the comments posted by global viewers, were retrieved and processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for sentiment analysis. Textual contents from review comments were analyzed to obtain a score to understand sentiment nature of the video. A regression technique based on Random forest was used to predict the rating of an advertisement using EEG data. Finally, EEG based rating is combined with NLP-based sentiment score to improve the overall prediction. The study was carried out using 15 video clips of advertisements available online. Twenty five participants were involved in our study to analyze our proposed system. The results are encouraging and these suggest that the proposed multimodal approach can achieve lower RMSE in rating prediction as compared to the prediction using only EEG data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",EEG signal analysis; Multimedia indexing and retrieval; Multimodal rating; Predictive modeling; Sentiment analysis,"Data mining; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Rating; EEG signals; Multi-modal; Multimedia indexing and retrieval; Predictive modeling; Sentiment analysis; Modal analysis; Article; conceptual framework; controlled study; decision tree; electroencephalography; human; human experiment; information processing; linear regression analysis; natural language processing; normal human; prediction; priority journal; random forest; regression analysis; sentiment analysis; signal processing; advertising; biological model; brain; consumer attitude; electroencephalography; Internet; physiology; procedures; Advertising as Topic; Brain; Consumer Behavior; Electroencephalography; Humans; Internet; Models, Neurological; Natural Language Processing","Gauba, H.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: gauba.himanshu@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,8936080,,NNETE,28254237,English,Neural Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013777747

The proposed feature is derived using improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and Hilbert transformation technique. The proposed feature uses the difference signal created by mapping of the fluid attenuation inversion recovery segmented region onto T1 and T1-contrast-enhanced MR images. This difference signal is decomposed into various intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using improved CEEMDAN algorithm that effectively captures the texture variations existing in both tumour groups. Then, the Hilbert transformation of resulting IMF is computed that provides the analytic signal representation, thereby giving a better visualisation of the texture difference. The proposed feature is calculated from this analytic signal representation at 97% confidence level. Subsequently, this feature is utilised to calculate a quantitative metric for tumour classification. The proposed metric has been validated on 120 tumorous images taken from brain tumour image segmentation benchmark (BRATS) 2012 dataset and the images taken from Harvard Medical School repository. The results illustrate that proposed metric yields an overall classification accuracy of 100% which is better than existing state-of-art works. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Brain; Functions; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical transformations; Medical imaging; Tumors; Classification accuracy; Contrast-enhanced MR; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Harvard Medical School; Hilbert transformations; Intrinsic Mode functions; Inversion recovery; Quantitative metric; Signal processing,"Kaur, T.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, Dr. B.

FES was applied to the rectus femoris (RF) muscle unilaterally of six able bodied (AB) and one individual with spinal cord injury (SCI). Each trial consisted of three repetitions of ES. We hypothesized that the EMD algorithm provides a suitable platform for decomposing the EMG signal into physically meaningful intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which can be further used to isolate electrical stimulation (ES) artifact. A basic EMD algorithm was used to decompose the EMG signals collected during FES into IMFs for each repetition separately. IMFs most contaminated by ES were identified based on the standard deviation (SD) of each IMF. Each artifact IMF was Notch filtered to filter ES harmonics and added to remaining IMFs containing pure EMG data to get a version of a filtered EMG signal. Of all such versions of filtered signals generated from each artifact IMF, the one with maximum signal to noise ratio (SNR) was chosen as the final output. The validity of the filtered signal was assessed by quantitative metrics, 1) root mean squared error (RMSE) and signal to noise (SNR) ratio values obtained by comparing a clean EMG and EMD-Notch filtered signal from the combination of simulated ES and clean EMG and, 2) using EMG-force correlation analysis on the data collected from AB individuals. Finally, the potential applicability of this algorithm on a neurologically impaired population was shown by applying the algorithm on EMG data collected from an individual with SCI. EMD combined with Notch filtering successfully extracted the EMG signal buried under ES artifact. Filtering performance was validated by smaller RMSE values and greater SNR post filtering. The amplitude values of the filtered EMG signal were seen to be consistent for three repetitions of ES and there was no significant difference among the repetition for all subjects. For the individual with a SCI the algorithm was shown to successfully isolate the underlying bursts of muscle activations during FES. The data driven nature of EMD algorithm and its ability to act as a filter bank at different bandwidths make this method extremely suitable for dissecting ES induced EMG into IMFs. Such IMFs clearly show the presence of ES artifact at different intensities as well as pure artifact free EMG. This allows the application of Notch filters to IMFs containing ES artifact to further isolate the EMG. As a result of such stepwise approach, the extraction of EMG is achieved with minimal data loss. This study provides a unique approach to dissect and interpret the EMG signal during FES applications. © 2017 IEEE.",Artifact removal; electromyogram (EMG) filtering; empirical mode decomposition; functional electrical stimulations,"Bandwidth; Electromyography; Functional electric stimulation; Mean square error; Muscle; Notch filters; Population statistics; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Sleep research; Artifact removal; Electromyogram; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Functional electri-cal stimulations; Functional electrical stimulation; Intrinsic Mode functions; Root mean squared errors; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); Biomedical signal processing; adult; algorithm; American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; amplitude modulation; Article; artifact; controlled study; electromyograph; electromyography; electrostimulation; Fourier transformation; frequency; human; human experiment; male; mathematical model; muscle contraction; rectus femoris muscle; signal noise ratio; spinal cord injury; stimulus; waveform; algorithm; artifact; clinical trial; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted therapy; electromyography; electrotherapy; innervation; middle aged; neurophysiological monitoring; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; skeletal muscle; Spinal Cord Injuries; statistical analysis; Adult; Algorithms; Artifacts; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electromyography; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Neurophysiological Monitoring; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Spinal Cord Injuries; Therapy, Computer-Assisted",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15344320,,ITNSB,27834646,English,IEEE Trans.

Thus, the usage of relay transmission is mainly applicable in enlarging the coverage without need of high transmitter power and attaining spatial diversity by node cooperation. This work is mainly intended on Physical-layer Network Coded (PNC) transmission for a two-way wireless transmission system where two source nodes, A and B, communicate through the aid of relay node using an Amplify and Forward(AF) strategy where the relay oversamples the received signal and subsequently filters before amplification.

Many of the digital signal processing applications use floating-point algorithms for execution of the floating-point computations and every operating system is answerable practically for floating-point special cases like underflow and overflow. The single precision floating point arithmetic operations are multiplication, division, addition and subtraction among all these multiplication is extensively used and involves composite arithmetic functions. The single precision (32-bit) floating point number split into three parts, Sign part, and Exponent part and Mantissa part. The most significant bit of the number is a sign bit and it is a 1-bit length. Next 8-bits represent the exponent part of the number and next 23-bits represent the mantissa part of the number. Mantissa part needs large 24-bit multiplication. The performance of the single-precision floating point number mostly based on the occupied area and delay of the multiplier. In this paper, a novel approach for single-precision floating multiplier is developed by using Urdhva Tiryagbhyam technique and different adders to decrease the complexity of mantissa multiplication. This requires less hardware for multiplication compared to that conventional multipliers and used different regular adders like carry select, carry skip adders and parallel prefix adders for exponent addition. Further, the performance parameters comparison was done in terms of area and delay.

However, conventional B-mode ultrasound imaging based measurement of CIMT is not amenable for deployment in large scale screening due to cost and expertise required to perform the test. We had developed and validated an image -free ultrasound technique for non-invasive, automated evaluation of arterial wall dynamics, called ARTSENS®, for use in vascular screening. Here we present a novel technique to evaluate a carotid artery wall thickness surrogate (CWTS) measure using ARTSENS®, utilizing a single-element 5 MHz ultrasound transducer. The method is based on real time analysis of ultrasound echoes obtained from the far-wall of the common carotid artery. Intelligent algorithms for automated identification of arterial walls, tracking of wall motion, and extraction of far wall structural echoes and measurement of a wall-thickness estimate were developed, and integrated into a prototype ARTSENS® device to enable real time measurement of wall thickness in-vivo. The performance of the system was evaluated using dynamic arterial flow phantoms and in-vivo studies on a set of 7 volunteers. The system could track changes in wall-thickness over a cardiac cycle in both phantoms as well as volunteers in real time. Accuracy of measurements was evaluated in comparison with a reference B-mode ultrasound imaging system. The CWTS measurements showed strong agreement with CIMT values measured with observed error 2.18% and 6.19% in phantom studies and in-vivo measurements respectively. CWTS measurements were also strongly related to CIMT measurements with a R2 value 0.86. While the CWTS is not a replacement for CIMT, but the results validate that it can be potentially used for mass screening purpose, since the measuring system is very cost-effective, easily portable, includes low signal processing overhead and can be used by any general practitioner with just minimal training. © 2017 IEEE.",analytic phase; carotid intima media thickness; carotid wall thickness surrogate; image-free ultrasound,Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Signal processing; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonic transducers; Accuracy of measurements; analytic phase; Automated identification; Carotid intima-media thickness; Intelligent Algorithms; Ultrasound imaging systems; Ultrasound transducers; Wall thickness; Ultrasonic applications,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The seizure detection by human inspection of EEG signals is prone to errors, inaccurate as well as time-consuming. Several attempts have been made to develop automatic systems so as to assist neurophysiologists in identifying epileptic seizures accurately. The proposed study brings forth a novel automatic approach to detect epileptic seizures using analytic time-frequency flexible wavelet transform (ATFFWT) and fractal dimension (FD). The ATFFWT has inherent attractive features such as, shift-invariance property, tunable oscillatory attribute and flexible time-frequency covering favorable for the analysis of non-stationary and transient signals. We have used ATFFWT to decompose EEG signals into the desired subbands. Following the ATFFWT decomposition, we calculate FD for each subband. Finally, FDs of all subbands have been fed to the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. The 10-fold cross validation has been used to obtain stable and reliable performance and to avoid the over fitting of the model. In this study, we investigate various different classification problems (CPs) pertaining to different classes of EEG signals, including the following popular CPs: (i) ictal versus normal (ii) ictal versus inter-ictal (iii) ictal versus non-ictal. The proposed model is found to be outperforming all existing models in terms of classification sensitivity (CSE) as it achieves perfect 100% sensitivity for seven CPs investigated by us. The prominent attribute of the proposed system is that though the model employs only one set of discriminating features (FD) for all CPs, it yields promising classification accuracy. Since, the proposed model attains the perfect classification performance it appears that a system is in place to assist clinicians to diagnose seizures accurately in less time.

The approach in this paper is applied on software simulated signals which partially resembles the PMU signals. Power System Toolbox (PST) is used to simulate IEEE 16 machine 68 bus test system to generate multiple signals. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) decompose multimode signal into separate modes but perfect decomposition by EMD is not always guaranteed therefore two mode decomposition techniques are used at two stages for effective mode decomposition. Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Cross Power Spectral Density (CPSD) tools are used to process decomposed modes for estimation of mode frequency and mode shape respectively. The mode shape results are compared and verified with the conventional approach i. e., eigenvalue analysis. Comparison shows that the approach is effective in mode shape estimation and hence it could also be applied on real-time PMU signals. © 2017 IEEE.",empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Inter-area mode; mode shape; spectral analysis,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Frequency estimation; Power spectral density; Spectral density; Spectrum analysis; Time domain analysis; Conventional approach; Cross-power spectral density; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Inter-area modes; Mode decomposition techniques; Mode shapes; Power spectral densities (PSD); Software simulated signals; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Manch.

Adaptive filtering, the essence of all digital signal processing applications, often faces the challenge of selecting a suitable adaptive algorithm which can mitigate the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and random noise. Recent trend has been to adopt soft computing optimization algorithms to optimize the parameters of adaptive filters. WDO is one of them. The objective of developing modifications in the original WDO is to improve the capability of carrying out global search and increase the accessibility of the global optimality. The proposed improved WDO seeks the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to bring about diversity in the population of swarm in each iteration, so that probability of the algorithm getting stuck in local optimum is greatly reduced. Improved WDO is implemented to optimize the coefficients of FIR based adaptive filter utilized to design Adaptive Channel Equalizer (ACE) and in System Identification (SI) task-Two vital applications of adaptive filtering.

Hence, the analysis of PQ disturbances becomes crucial to maintain the reliability of the distributed generation (DG). This paper presents the analysis of various disturbances like voltage swell, voltage sag, notch, flicker, spike, harmonics, momentary interruption and oscillatory transients by using a signal processing technique i.e. modified Stockwell transform (MST). The technique is employed to provide sufficient time-frequency characteristics and retain the phase information of input to detect the different PQ disturbances. Moreover, the localization of Gaussian window is exploited by providing different scaling parameters which correspond to the linear phase of frequency and provides better resolution. The voltage signal is utilized for the detection of the disturbances at a point of common coupling. The time-frequency features are re-transformed into the time space (original signal) by using the inverse modified S-transform to visualize the different PQ disturbances in real-time.

ASIC, DSP and FPGA are the different tools to meet the constraints. In most of the situations where signals are highly fluctuating i.e. signals are varying with time, fixed filters which are designed with the fixed parameters cannot be used therefore one can go for adaptive filters. For the cancellation of noise signal adaptive filtering technique is used. In many applications of noise cancellation the changes in signal is quite fast. This requires adaptive algorithm, which converge rapidly. From this point of view LMS and Averaging algorithms suit these situations best. LMS algorithm is one of the most used algorithms in many signal processing applications. Unfortunately LMS algorithm has high computation complexity and stability problems. In order to overcome these problems averaging algorithm can be used, where high convergence rate cab be achieved compare to that of LMS algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",Adaptive filtering; Averaging algorithm; Filter length; LMS algorithm; Step size,Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Digital signal processing; Signal denoising; Signal filtering and prediction; Spurious signal noise; Adaptive filtering algorithms; Computation complexity; Filter length; Filtering technique; LMS algorithms; Noise cancellation; Signal processing applications; Step size; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The advanced technological world demands electric power which is free from any disturbance. Many of these problems such as equipment failure, and low response of equipment are the results of the disruption of the electric power supply. Computer based processes or automatic system fails to operate due to these power disturbances. Hence, detection and classification of these power quality events is necessary to avoid such incidents. In this paper, nine classes of power quality (PQ) events are detected by applying discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and multi-resolution signal decomposition (MSD). DWT coefficients based approach for the energy contents in the different frequency zone is proposed for the classification of PQ disturbances. The coefficients at each levels are used for extracting the features of various disturbances. Classification is done on the basis of DWT and MSD with these extracted features. Features extracted using DWT coefficients have important role for classifying different PQ disturbances. Several simulations for detection and classification of these PQ events based on MSD and DWT are performed. Classification of all nine events is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",Discrete wavelet transform; Multi-resolution signal decomposition; Power quality disturbance,Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Power quality; Signal distortion; Signal processing; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Different frequency; Electric power supply; Equipment failures; Power disturbances; Power quality disturbances; Power quality event; Signal decomposition; Technological world; Discrete wavelet transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

A prosthetic device is a biomimetic device that replaces a missing body part of an amputee which may be lost due to trauma, disease or congenital conditions. A myoelectric prosthesis is controlled by sEMG signals. The sEMG signals are electrical manifestation of neuro muscular activities which is recorded non-invasively using bio-potential electrodes. In this work, three surface electrodes are placed on the forearm over the relevant muscles. The acquired sEMG signals are filtered, amplified and converted into the digital signal when the forearm muscles get contracted and relaxed. The output of the processed is further transmitted to the controller to which the five DC motor of the prosthetic hand are connected.

High performance can only be achieved at the cost of high power dissipation. Nowadays, the use of FPGAs is rapidly increasing due to its low cost and smaller time to market. Todays high end FPGAs are capable of implementing high performance designs such as transceivers for RF application, signal processing and image processing applications etc. This is only possible due to their complex designs that includes on chip dedicated multipliers, Dual RAM blocks, Ethernet and DCMs etc. Since FPGAs consume large amount of power, it becomes a challenge for the designers to implement low power battery operated communication systems. Several power estimation models are available in literature for early stage power estimation of FPGAs in the synthesis design flow but they provide less accuracy (high percentage error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique. This paper presents the limitation of existing power estimation model proposed by Deng. The given model is converted into a script using MATLAB. The power values estimated from the power model (script) are compared with the high level synthesis tool: Xpower Analyzer targeted to Virtex FPGA. For estimation of power values, an embedded multiplier is synthesized for two different configurations: one with CE (low power) and another without CE for different I/O vector length. The results suggested that the given low level power estimation models provide less accuracy (high % error) for the designs incorporated with low power reduction technique i.e. with CE. Further, there is a scope of remodel the existing model for the observed shortcoming. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Embedded multiplier; FPGAs; IP block; MATLAB; Power estimation model,Embedded systems; Frequency multiplying circuits; High level synthesis; Image communication systems; Image processing; MATLAB; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Embedded multiplier; High-performance design; Image processing applications; IP block; Low-power synthesis; Power estimations; Wireless communication system; Wireless telecommunication technologies; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA),"Verma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-62, India; email: gaurav.iitkg@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996554617

The PSI technique is presently extended for structure subjected to seismic excitations. The high dimensionality of the phase space for seismic response(s) are overcome by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), decomposing the responses to a number of intrinsic low dimensional oscillatory modes, referred as Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Along with their low dimensionality, a few IMFs, retain sufficient information of the system dynamics to reflect the damage induced changes. The mutually conflicting nature of low-dimensionality and the sufficiency of dynamic information are taken care by the optimal choice of the IMF(s), which is shown to be the third/fourth IMFs. The optimal IMF(s) are employed for the reconstruction of the Phase space attractor following Taken's embedding theorem. The widely referred Changes in Phase Space Topology (CPST) feature is then employed on these Phase portrait(s) to derive the damage sensitive feature, referred as the CPST of the IMFs (CPST-IMF).

The EEG electrode and feature selection (EFS) problem here has been formulated in the framework of an optimization problem with an aim to simultaneously satisfying four criteria. The first criterion deals with maximization of the correlation between the selected features of EEG source signals, before and after the selection of optimum electrodes. It thus ensures the preservation of information of the cortical sources corresponding to a cognitive task even after reducing the number of electrodes. The second criterion is concerned with minimization of the mutual information between the selected features of the EEG signals recorded by the selected electrodes. It helps in identifying the unique information by reducing the redundancy in the EEG signals recorded by the selected electrodes for a specific cognitive task. The third criterion aims at optimal selection of EEG electrodes and EEG features in an attempt to i) minimize the difference between the selected EEG source-features (to ensure their similarity) for a specific cognitive task and ii) maximize the difference between the selected EEG source-features (to ensure the efficient categorization) of different cognitive tasks. The last criterion is concerned with maximization of the classification accuracy of different cognitive tasks based on the selected EEG source-features, corresponding to the selected EEG electrodes. The originality of the paper lies in obtaining the sets of optimum EEG electrodes and EEG features by independent optimization of individual objectives. These sets of optimum EEG electrodes and EEG features are then ranked based on their fuzzy memberships to satisfy individual four objectives. A self-adaptive variant of firefly algorithm (referred to as SAFA) is proposed to optimize individual objectives by proficiently balancing the trade-off between the computational accuracy and the run-time complexity. Experiments undertaken over wide variety of cognitive tasks reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other standard algorithms (applied to the same problem) in terms of accuracy and computational overhead. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",EEG electrodes; EEG feature; Firefly algorithm; Sink signal; Source signal,Bioluminescence; Economic and social effects; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Optimization; Classification accuracy; Computational accuracy; Computational overheads; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Evolutionary approach; Evolutionary perspective; Firefly algorithms; Source signals; Biomedical signal processing; algorithm; Article; cognition; electroencephalograph electrode; electroencephalography; human; independent component analysis; priority journal; signal processing; spectrometry; task performance; white noise,"Rakshit, P.; Electronics &Telecommunication Engineering Department, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: pratyushar1@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

A modified version of EMD, denoted as MEMD, which extracts IMFs with lesser mode-mixing, and provides a better representation of the higher frequency spectrum of speech, is also utilized for the SV task. Three different features are extracted over 20 ms frames, from the IMFs of EMD and MEMD. They are, then, tested individually, and in conjunction with the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), for SV. Two corpora - the NIST SRE 2003 corpus, and the CHAINS corpus - are used for the experiments. The results evaluated on the NIST SRE 2003 database, using the i-vector framework, reveal that the features extracted from the IMFs, in conjunction with the MFCCs, enhances the performance of the SV system. Further, it is observed that only a small set of lower-order IMFs is useful and necessary for characterizing speaker-specific information. The combination of the features with the MFCCs is also found to be useful when short speech utterances of ?10 s are used for testing. Similarly, the results evaluated on the CHAINS corpus, using the conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) framework, reveal that the features, in combination with the MFCCs, enhance the performance of the SV system, not only for normal speech, but also for fast and whispered speech. Again, it is observed that only the first few IMFs are needed and useful for achieving such enhanced performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",EMD; GMM; i-vector; IMFs; MEMD; MFCCs; SV,Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Chains; Functions; Gaussian distribution; Signal processing; Speech; Speech recognition; Empirical Mode Decomposition; I vectors; IMFs; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; MEMD; MFCCs; Speaker specific informations; Text-independent speaker verification; Audio signal processing,"Sharma, R.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: s.rajib@iitg.ernet.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1676393,,SCOMD,,English,Speech Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018315029

A good quality EEG signal provides the proper interpretation and identification of physiological and pathological phenomena. However, these recordings are often corrupted by different kinds of noise. As Savitzky Golay smoothing filter (SGSF) preserves the peaks and minimize the signal distortion, its use in cascade may further enhance this capability. Therefore in the present work cascaded SGSF (CSGSF) is proposed to filter the noisy EEG signals. The CSGSF combines two successive Savitzky Golay filters. For comparative analysis, other cascaded arrangements like cascaded moving average filter (CMAF), MAF-SGSF, SGSF-Binomial and single stage SGSF are also designed. These filters are tested on artificial EEG signals added with white Gaussian noise and non Gaussian noise. These filters are also tested on real time EEG signals. The filtered signals are assessed through signal to noise ratio (SNR), signal to signal plus noise ratio (SSNR), SNR improvement (SNRI), mean square error (MSE) and correlation coefficient (COR). It is revealed from the results that CSGSF outperforms the other designed filters in case of artificial and real time EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cascaded Savitzky Golay smoothing filter; EEG signal; Gaussian noise; Non-Gaussian noise,Bandpass filters; Electroencephalography; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Mean square error; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Correlation coefficient; EEG signals; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Moving average filter; Non-Gaussian noise; Savitzky-Golay filter; Signalto-signal-plus-noise ratio (SSNR); Smoothing filters; Biomedical signal processing; Article; digital filtering; electric activity; electroencephalogram; kernel method; noise reduction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Savitzky Golay smoothing filter; signal noise ratio; signal processing,"Agarwal, S.email: agarwal.shivangi@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

For adaptive equalization, minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion-based reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) approaches such as the kernel least mean squares (KLMS) algorithm and its variants have been suggested in the literature for nonlinear channels. Another optimality criterion, based on minimum bit/symbol error rate (MBER/MSER), is a better choice for adapting an equalizer as compared to MMSE criterion. A kernel-based minimum symbol error rate (KMSER) equalization algorithm combines minimum symbol error rate (MSER)-based approaches with RKHS techniques. However, most algorithms in RKHS such as KMSER/KLMS require infinite storage requirement and hence cannot be practically implemented. To curtail the infinite memory requirement, and make adaptive algorithm suitable for implementation with finite memory and processing power, we propose quantized KMSER (QKMSER) and fixed-budget quantized KMSER (FBQKMSER)-based equalizers in this paper. In this paper, we derive the dynamical equation for MSE evolution of the QKMSER and FBQKMSER and find their performance to be asymptotically close to the MSE behavior of the KMSER. Also, it is found via simulations that the tracking performance of FBQKMSER is better than all the compared algorithms in this paper which is particularly useful for non-stationary channels. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",Fixed-budget KMSER; Kernel trick; Minimum symbol error rate criterion; Nonlinear equalization; Quantized KMSER; RKHS; VLC,Adaptive algorithms; Bit error rate; Budget control; Errors; Interference suppression; Mean square error; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Fixed budget; Kernel trick; Minimum symbol error rates; Nonlinear equalization; Quantized KMSER; RKHS; Equalizers,"Mitra, R.; Signals and Software Group, Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology IndoreIndia; email: phd1301202010@iiti.ac.in",,Springer London,18631703,,,,English,Signal Image Video Process.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000997370

The phase of EGG signal has not attracted much attention, although it is robust and capable of revealing dynamics of glottal activity. The main objective of this work is to develop a robust and accurate technique for analyzing the glottal activity by exploiting the phase of EGG signal. Using the phase of EGG signal, accurate and robust methods are proposed to detect glottal closure instant (GCI) and glottal opening instant (GOI) within a glottal cycle. The glottal activity during close and open phases of a glottal cycle can be precisely analysed by using GCIs and GOIs respectively. Robustness of the proposed method for detection of GCIs and GOIs is also evaluated in vulnerable cases such as transition in laryngeal mechanism, weak voicing and voice transition. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using manually labeled EGG signals chosen from CMU Arctic database, and the performance of the proposed method is also compared with the state-of-the-art singularity in EGG by multiscale analysis (SIGMA) method.

A two-stage separation procedure is proposed for single-channel (SC) speech separation. Initial stage of separation is done using EMD, HT and instantaneous frequencies. EMD decomposes the mixed signal into oscillatory functions known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Suitable IMFs are selected using successive EMD decomposition and HT is applied to extract the instantaneous frequencies. The speech frames are grouped into two speakers using correlation of instantaneous frequencies between mixed signal and selected IMFs. Second-stage separation is done by further decomposing the estimated speakers into IMFs and finding the instantaneous amplitudes using HT. A ratio of instantaneous amplitudes of mixed speech and stage 1 recovered speech signal is computed for both speakers. Histogram of the ratio obtained can be used to estimate the ideal binary mask for each speaker. These masks are applied to the speech mixture and the underlying speakers are estimated. The proposed method was compared with the existing unsupervised SC source separation algorithms. The results show significant improvement in objective measures. © 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Audio recordings; Mathematical transformations; Separation; Signal processing; Speech; Speech analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hilbert Huang transforms; Instantaneous amplitude; Instantaneous frequency; Intrinsic Mode functions; Oscillatory functions; Separation algorithms; Single-channel speech separations; Source separation,"Mundodu Krishna, P.K.; Department of Telecommunication Engineering, BMS College of EngineeringIndia; email: prasannamk.tce@bmsce.ac.in",,Institution of Engineering and Technology,17519675,,,,English,IET Signal Proc.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021061180

In this paper, we present a new methodology for EEG-based automated diagnosis of epilepsy. Our method involves detection of key points at multiple scales in EEG signals using a pyramid of difference of Gaussian filtered signals. Local binary patterns (LBPs) are computed at these key points and the histogram of these patterns are considered as the feature set, which is fed to the support vector machine (SVM) for the classification of EEG signals. The proposed methodology has been investigated for the four well-known classification problems namely, 1) normal and epileptic seizure, 2) epileptic seizure and seizure free, 3) normal, epileptic seizure, and seizure free, and 4) epileptic seizure and nonseizure EEG signals using publically available university of Bonn EEG database. Our experimental results in terms of classification accuracies have been compared with existing methods for the classification of the aforementioned problems. Further, performance evaluation on another EEG dataset shows that our approach is effective for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals.

However, its efficient design and practical implementation has not yet been achieved on mote platforms that are typical in wireless sensor network due to resource constrains. In this paper, we propose StructS-XCorr: cross-correlation via structured sparse representation, a new computing framework for ranging based on ?1 1 -norm minimization [1] and structured sparsity. The key idea is to compress the ranging signal samples on the mote by efficient random projections and transfer them to a central device; where a convex optimization process estimates the range by exploiting the sparse signal structure in the proposed correlation dictionary. Through theoretical validation, extensive empirical studies and experiments on an end-to-end acoustic ranging system implemented on resource limited off-the-shelf sensor nodes, we show that the proposed framework can achieve up to two orders of magnitude better performance compared to other approaches such as working on DCT domain and downsampling. Compared to the standard cross-correlation, it is able to obtain range estimates with a bias of 2-6 cm with 30 percent and approximately 100 cm with 5 percent compressed measurements.

However SC-FDMA is very sensitive to carrier frequency offset(CFO), which affects the error rate performance of the system adversely. This paper proposes an efficient signal processing technique known as fractional Fourier transform(FRFT) for Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing(SCFDM) over Nakagami-m fading channel in the presence of CFO. A clear improvement has been shown in symbol error rate(SER) by using FRFT block in place of FFT block. Simulation results confirm that FRFT-SCFDM outperforms FFT-SCFDM as its probability of error can be controlled by varying FRFT angle(?) without significant increase in the complexity. Further, we have compared the FRFT implementations of SCFDM and OFDM and observed a gain of 7 dB for FRFT-SCFDM over FRFT-OFDM at CFO(?) equals 0.1. Further, no change in PAPR, no significant increase in complexity with improved SER performance or quality of service(QoS) motivates FRFT-SCFDMA to be one of the potential candidates for uplink transmission for 5G radio access networks(RAN). © 2017 IEEE.",Bit error rate; Carrier Frequency Offset; Fourier transforms; FRFT; OFDM; QoS; RAN; SCFDMA,Bit error rate; Carrier communication; Complex networks; Errors; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Fast Fourier transforms; Fourier transforms; Frequency allocation; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Quality of service; Radio transmission; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; 3rd generation partnership project (3gpp) long term evolutions; Carrier frequency offsets; Fractional Fourier transforms; FRFT; Orthogonal frequency division multiple access; SC-FDMA; Single carrier frequency division multiple access(SCFDMA); Singlecarrier frequency-division-multiplexing (SCFDM); Frequency division multiple access,,Papadias C.B.Jamalipour A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

SAR images are widely accepted and used by many application scientists. However, the SAR images are corrupted with speckle noise. Speckle noises are caused by random interference of electromagnetic signals scattered by the object surface within one resolution element. The amount of noise and distribution of noise corrupting the image is unpredictable. Conventional noise filters are quantitative in nature; they are not well suited for uncertainty problems. Fuzzy logic is capable of handling uncertainty. In this work, noisy pixels in the images are identified by using fuzzy rules and filtered using fuzzy weighted mean, keeping the healthy pixels unchanged. The optimum value of parameters used in defining fuzzy membership function is determined by using genetic algorithm (GA). Reducing noise and simultaneously preserving image details are the two most desirable characteristics of noise filters.

Due to these factors or capabilities, patch antennas are able to overcome the rising demands in the field of wireless communication like high gain, high power, maximized throughput and low losses. Metamaterials are the synthetic materials that are engineered to have some exclusive properties those are not found in any naturally existing materials. These materials possess their properties due to their structure and not because of the material they are composed of. The stacking of patch antennas i.e. The use of one patch over other is an effective method to improve their performance for the dual frequency and broadband operation which is required in most of the high frequency wireless applications. The closure between the two conducting surfaces subjected to an excitation will lead to a strong mutual coupling between them. This is the reason for the bandwidth enhancement and the use of it for operation at multiple frequencies. The objective of the work presented in the paper is to study the performance of the patch antenna by stacking its dielectric with a metamaterial. The paper presents a theoretical study of the use of metamaterial superstrates to improve the performance of patch antennas. The output parameters of patch antenna without and with the metamaterial superstrate were obtained using MATLAB and their comparison is done to understand the effect of the metamaterial when it is used in a patch antenna. © 2016 IEEE.",enhanced performance etc; high frequency; metamaterial superstrates; Micrsostrip; patch antenna; wireless applications,Antennas; MATLAB; Metamaterial antennas; Metamaterials; Signal processing; Slot antennas; Structure (composition); Wireless telecommunication systems; enhanced performance etc; High frequency HF; Micrsostrip; Superstrates; Wireless application; Microstrip antennas,"Mahamuni, C.V.; Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Fr.

The rise of voltage-sensitive load equipment has made industrial processes much more susceptible to deprivation in the quality of power supply. Voltage variations, often in the form of voltage sags and swells, can cause rigorous process disturbances and result in significant economic loss. The custom power devices which uses the power electronic devices, is one of the method by which power quality problems might be compensate. Among the numerous norm power devices, the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) for use in distribution systems is a recent innovation. The mitigation capability of a DVR depends initially on the maximum voltage injection ability and within the restorer the amount of stored energy existing. In this paper a phase advanced multi-loop control scheme is used to increase the voltage renovation property of the device. Using this novel method it can be shown that the disturbances occurred in the system can be corrected with less amount of storage energy.

In this paper, two electrical equivalent circuit models, variable leakage resistance (VLR) model and charge redistribution based model, have been considered for comparative study. Both the models have been analyzed based on the charge and long term self-discharge responses obtained through experimentation and simulation. The device under test is the Maxwell BCAP0100 P270 T07 supercapacitor. First, it has been charged at 2A constant current to its rated voltage; then, has been left for self-discharge. The terminal voltage has been collected for total charging time as well as self-discharge for 8000 seconds. The data have been acquired using National Instruments (NI) hardware and LabVIEW software. Based on the case study used in this paper, it is observed that the charge redistribution based model is better able to capture the self-discharge phenomenon. However, the error in the VLR model may not be insignificant always. © 2016 IEEE.",Charge redistribution; Electrical equivalent circuit; Self discharge; Supercapacitor; Ultracapacitor,Circuit simulation; Circuit theory; Computer programming languages; Electric network parameters; Embedded systems; Signal processing; Supercapacitor; Timing circuits; Wireless sensor networks; Charge redistribution; Comparative studies; Electrical equivalent circuit; Equivalent circuit model; Lab-view softwares; National Instruments; Self-discharge analysis; Self-discharges; Equivalent circuits,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The voltage level of ECG signal ranges from as low as 0.5 to 5mV and frequency components fall into the range of 0.05 to 100Hz. Various noises like Power Line Interference (PLI), baseline wander and noise due to muscles contraction and relaxation get added into the recorded ECG signal. Out of them, PLI is considered to be the major source of noise. PLI may be stationary or non stationary. Non adaptive filters are employed to remove stationary power line interference and adaptive cancellers are used to handle non-stationary power line interference. In this paper adaptive LMS algorithm along with Kalman filtering became KLMS has been investigated to eliminate PLI from contaminated ECG signal. The results of KLMS filter has been compared with the LMS filter before and after filtering the ECG signal. Results shows MSE equal to 0.6314 and 0.0409 before filtering for LMS and KLMS filter respectively. MSE equal to 0.1983 and 0.0245 after filtering for LMS and KLMS filter respectively.

The proposed method of eliminating the grating lobes can be used in the cases where each antenna element information/data is available. By using the proposed method, relation between ? and baseline separation between the two antenna elements need not be less than or equal to ?/2. The proposed method eliminates the Grating lobes without hardware complexity with little processing load. It also reduces the antenna elements giving the same antenna pattern. Gain of the antenna patterns decides the number and the spacing between the antenna elements in the antenna array. © 2016 IEEE.",Antenna phase centres; Array Antenna; Baseline separation distance; Linear array Transmit/Receive elements,Antenna arrays; Directional patterns (antenna); Processing; Signal processing; Antenna element; Array antennas; Baseline separation; Grating lobes; Hardware complexity; Linear arrays; Phase centres; Processing load; Antenna lobes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Hence, physical characteristics demonstrated by leaves act as fingerprints for their identification.

The increasing of the load also favours to the complexity of power system. The complexity of the power system can easily handled by analyzing the performance of the transmission system by using load flows. The real and reactive power losses are largely effected at the transmission level. With the advancement in power electronics, the advanced compensation devices are improved which are called FACTS. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices have been proposed as an effective solution for controlling power flow and regulating bus voltage in electrical power systems, resulting in an increased transfer capability, low system losses, and improve stability. However to what extent the performance of FACTS devices can be brought out highly depends upon the location and the parameters of these devices. In this paper, we propose three Evolutionary Optimization Techniques, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) to select the optimal location and the optimal parameter setting of TCSC, firing angle of TCSC and size of the TCSC which minimize the active power losses and improves the voltage profiles in the power network, and compare their performances.

Voltage collapses usually occur on power systems which are heavily loaded or faulted or have shortage of reactive power. This paper analyses the voltage stability of the power system under increasing load conditions. Modal analysis technique and Continuation Power flow methods have been used to identify the weakest buses prone to voltage collapse. Eigen values are used to determine the system voltage stability and participation factors are used to determine the weakest bus which has the maximum contribution to voltage collapse of the system. FACTS controllers (SVC and STATCOM) are then applied to the weakest buses for voltage improvement. Comparison is made between the performances of the power system with and without FACTS compensation. The tests have been carried out on IEEE 30 and 57 bus systems. Further, this analysis has been extended to the North-Eastern Grid of India.

The Dual UPQC incorporates of two active filters the shunt active filter and the series active filter. The Dual UPQC (iUPQC) is combination of two active filters, a series active filter and a shunt active filter (parallel active filter), used to terminate harmonics and unbalances. Divergent from a conventional UPQC, the iUPQC has the series filter managed as a sinusoidal current source and the shunt filter constrained as a sinusoidal voltage source.

Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, Twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on Twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from Twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from Twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets. © 2016 IEEE.",N-gram; Word2vec,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Embedded systems; Finance; Forecasting; Investments; Signal processing; Social networking (online); Dow Jones Industrial averages; N-grams; Sentiment analysis; Stock market prediction; Strong correlation; Supervised machine learning; Textual representation; Word2vec; Financial markets,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Therefore, more sophisticated techniques are required to combat with network congestion. Various constrained resources of the WSN are to be taken into account while devising such mechanisms. Different approaches for congestion detection and avoidance have been introduced in the past few years. The traditional flooding and gossiping algorithm can cause loss of data. To tackle some of the issues, this paper presents a novel approach for congestion control based dynamic routing. In the proposed work, whenever the packet traversal experiences the congestion, an alternate path is computed to reroute the packets on the new path. The proposed work has three phases namely congestion detection, alternate path computation and re-routing the packets on new path. Congestion in the path can be detected based on the free space available in the buffer. Alternate path is computed based on available bandwidth, hop distance and residual energy on the path. This work is simulated using C for its effectiveness. Some of the performance parameters considered in this work are route discovery time, congestion ratio, delay etc. © 2016 IEEE.",Alternate path computation; Congestion Control; Wireless sensor network,Bandwidth; Congestion control (communication); Embedded systems; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Alternate path; Area of interest; Available bandwidth; Congestion detection; Constrained resources; Network congestions; Performance parameters; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

There have some security issues like data leaks during data sharing, key management of shared data etc. In our project we developed a system which enables secure data sharing in the group of users as well as efficient key management. In our proposed system we used public key cryptography for securely storing and sharing data in cloud. We have created secure constant cipher text which is impartial of data size. It is possible to share data and to give authorized rights for decryption of any set of cipher text. Along with the encrypted data a searchable index is generated to provide search over the encrypted data. The data owner can share subset of files with other users by authorizing them an access rights and constant size of aggregate key. By doing this we are confidential about other outside files as those files cannot be decrypted using the given key. As per access rights search can be applied over restricted data set. Search can also be applied for synonym words. System performance and efficient index generation are the key aspect of our project.

CSE algorithm uses binary representation of coefficients for the implementation of higher order FIR filter with a fewer variety of adders than Canonic Signed Digit (CSD)-based CSE methods. According to the VHBCSE Algorithm, initially 2-bit binary common sub-expression elimination algorithm has been applied vertically across adjacent coefficients on the 2-D space of the coefficient matrix followed by applying 4-bit and 8-bit BCSE algorithm horizontally within each coefficient. Thus there is reduced power consumption by minimum switching activity along with an improvement in the area and delay.

So there is a lot of complexity to finding and determining the targets with small cross sectional area. This drawback drastically nocks the necessity for antenna pattern design with a high value of gain and extremely minimized side lobe level (SLL). In order to achieve the above requirements we proposed a thinned elliptical cylindrical antennas for analyzing the side lobe level using SaDE optimization technique with hyper beam. Simulation results shows that the side lobe level reduced to less than -40 db. Particle swarm optimization is also considered to compare the results of SaDE optimization technique.

Earlier electric power systems were small and localized. Thus, Real and reactive power compensation in transmission line is essential which will improve the stability of ac system. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) technology provides new opportunity to control the power and enhancing the capacity of the present as well as new line sit is used to investigate the effect of this device in controlling active and reactive powers as well as damping power system oscillations in transient mode. A Transmission line needs controllable compensation for power flow control and voltage regulation. This can be achieved by FACTS controllers. The employed compensators are three-phase (IGBT) based, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) operated Converter (VSC). The proposed control employ proportional-integral (PI) controller to generate a constant error. Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) is series reactive power compensation to a power system. The output of an SSSC is series injected voltage, which leads or lags line current by 90°, thus emulating a controllable inductive or capacitive reactance. SSSC can be used to reduce the line impedance and enhance the active power transfer capability of the line. With the parameters and control, the SSSC is found effective to regulate load voltage during sudden change of the loads. The SSSC also provides stable operation with dynamic induction motor load and mitigates the unstable and oscillating behaviour that is resulting during the operation of compensated Alternator with dynamic motor load. The presented results prove that SSSC systems provide satisfactory performance The advantage of this approach is that it can handle the nonlinearities, at the same time it is faster than other conventional controllers and it improve the reactive power of the system. Simulation studies will be carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Static synchronous series compensator (SSSC). Results will show that the proposed SSSC based damping controllers improve the damping performance event of a major disturbance as well as Reactive power control. © 2016 IEEE.",Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS); Pulse Width Modulation (PWM); Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC); Voltage Source Converter(VSC),Controllers; Damping; Electric impedance measurement; Electric lines; Electric power system stability; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Energy transfer; Flexible AC transmission systems; Induction motors; Modulation; Power control; Pulse width modulation; Reactive power; Signal processing; Static synchronous compensators; System stability; Voltage regulators; Active and reactive power; Damping power system oscillations; Flexible alternating current transmission systems; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Proportional integral controllers; Reactive power compensation; Static synchronous series compensator; Voltage source converters; Electric power transmission,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

There exist many Scheduling Algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling, Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MLQ). This paper proposes a new strategy consolidating three of the existing scheduling algorithms to create a new strategy that reduces the time a process spends in waiting state. The proposed algorithm also reduces the number of context switches to provide a fair, efficient and methodical scheduling algorithm. The algorithm is an extended version of Round Robin Algorithm where each of the processes is given a priority level (low, medium or high) and based on the priority level, the Time Quantum for that process is decided and executed. The throughput of the algorithm is increased by executing processes with smaller burst time or smaller remaining burst time by allocating the process to the CPU as soon as it is ready but not pre-empting the running process. © 2016 IEEE.",Context Switch; CPU Scheduling; Priority; RR; SJF; Time Quantum; Turn Around Time; Waiting Time,Scheduling; Signal processing; Turnaround time; Context switch; CPU scheduling; Priority; Time quantum; Waiting-time; Scheduling algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Generally, due to magnetic limitation, a single Flyback transformer cannot handle high power. Hence, for relatively higher power applications, people prefer the use of interleaved Flyback converter structures. But the interleaved Flyback converter requires the use of two switches. The interesting feature of the proposed converter is that power handling of both the Flyback transformers can be done by a single switch of same voltage rating as that of the conventional interleaved Flyback converter. Hence the solution requires less number of components resulting in a compact and low-cost structure. The voltage rating of the power electronic devices used is much less than the total output voltage in the ideal condition. This results in low conduction loss and high efficiency of voltage step-up conversion. As the output of the two Flyback sub-converters is connected in series to boost the voltage level, the requirement of the turn's ratio of each transformer is less if we compare the turn's ratio requirement of the interleaved Flyback converter used presently. This result in tighter coupling between the windings of the transformer, which reduces the value of the leakage inductance, which causes high losses and unwanted voltage spikes along with radiated noises affecting various part of the circuit and the surrounding. Detailed Explanation of the working of the circuit is given through the modes of operation and a detailed steady-state analysis has been done.

Seamless controlling home, monitoring and programming by the end user have yet to enter the mainstream. This could be legitimate to the challenge of developing a fully independent and extensible home system that can support devices and technologies of differing functionalities and protocols. This paper describes how to control and monitor home appliances using android application over internet. There are number of commercial home automation systems available in market. However, these are designed for limited use. Therefore, home appliances can individually be controlled both from within the home and remotely. This is very helpful to physically challenged people. The practical goal of this paper has been to create a virtual, but practically usable, android home automation system. The android mobile is used to send the commands to the Arduino to control all the home appliances. The main feature of this system is to control the voltage levels of home appliance in home like speed of fan based on temperature, intensity of light based on light intensity etc. and another feature is we may get the status of our home appliances from our android mobile phone.

The results of applying DFT to in genomic sequence signals that they can discriminate using messenger RNA for identifying inter nucleotide sequences. Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) applications in bioinformatics research have received great attention in recent years, where new effective methods for genomic sequence analysis, such as the detection of converting the genomic sequences into signals have been developed. The use of GSP principles to analyze genomic sequences that requires defining an adequate representation of the nucleotide by numerical values, converting the nucleotide sequences into nucleotide signals. In this paper we present an approach of GSP algorithm which is used in conversion of genomic sequences into signals and also calculating the peaks at coding regions This article also shows the comparative study at the different peaks at a certain elapsed time.

Most power systems can accommodate a certain level of harmonic but we have problems when harmonics become an indicative component of overall load. As these higher frequency harmonics flow through the power system affects the communication, overheating and hardware damage such as overheating of electrical equipment, cables, transformers, generators. High voltages and circulating currents caused by harmonic resonance. Hence for the detection of these harmonics current total harmonic distortion the use of the passive power filter, active power filter and hybrid power filter. Then, as an investigation this paper extends the existing comparisons found in with a proposed simulation study. The study isolates the harmonic detection method from the active filter and out places the input waveform from the sensors with a known waveform, artificially constructed. Thus, the output waveform that should be expectable now is noted and differentiates between each analyzed harmonic detection method. Traditionally passive power filter was used as a solution for this problem, caused by the system harmonics, since they are easy to design, having simple structure low cost, high efficiency, lower voltage regulation and phase advanced synchronous capacitors etc. However traditionally controllers have many drawbacks. Which provides only fixed compensation, generates resonance problem and are bulky in size. To overcome these problems active power filter are introduced satisfy for the current harmonics and to minimize the THD. This project the comparisons will be found with a proposed simulation gives separation of the harmonic identified method from the active filter and replaces the input signal from the detector with a familiar signal, Also find the output signal that should be predictable now is noted and differentiate between each estimated harmonic detection schemes.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication which can play an effective role in the monitoring of the remote areas for applications like military surveillance, seismic activity monitoring, earthquake detection and disaster relief operations etc. The nodes are randomly deployed in the sensor field for such applications because of which the density of nodes in some part of the area to be monitored will be more and other areas might be very less. Another problem is the physical access to sensor nodes in these areas is extremely challenging, so the human intervention is not easy. Thus, the replacement of nodes or recharging their batteries is practically impossible.

The boundary between analog and digital signal processing is moving closer to the antenna. So for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) of radio receivers this indicates higher sample rate, higher resolution, and lower power dissipation. The wireless receiver architectures, showing the greatest potential to meet the commercial trends, include the direct conversion receiver and the super heterodyne receiver with an ADC sampling at the intermediate frequency (IF). The SAR ADC architecture, based on the switched capacitor (SC) technique, has most successfully covered the widely separated resolution and sample rate requirements of these receiver architectures. A 12-bit resolution is chosen considering the dynamic range of input signal. To avoid common-mode errors, the SAR ADC uses a differential topology. To decrease area, power and cost while maintaining 12-bit accuracy, the Binary-Weighted (BW) capacitor array is split into two sub-BW capacitor arrays. A dynamic latch discriminates voltage differences as small as 100 ? while concurrently working with rail-to-rail input signals. A uni-directional switching technique is introduced to minimize the dynamic power.

In this paper novel hybrid cloud security method is proposed in order to deliver both efficient revocation and enhanced security. This hybrid approach is combination of two well know security techniques such as IBE and ABE. The ABE method is combined with IBE to achieve the strong security against different threats. Along with user identity, his/her attributes like country or kind of subscription he/she has are used for further process of IBE encryption, decryption and revocation. Another problem of efficient identity revocation is further addressed by presenting the outsourcing computation into hybrid IBE (H-IBE) method at server aided settings. The other components and methods of proposed H-IBE are discussed during this paper and evaluated the performance against existing method. © 2016 IEEE.",ABE; Cloud Computing; Decryption; Encryption; Hybrid IBE; Key Generation; KU-CSP,Cloud computing; Embedded systems; Signal processing; Attribute-based encryptions; Cloud computing environments; Cloud computing securities; Cloud computing services; Decryption; Hybrid IBE; Identity Based Encryption; Key generation; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this approach to enhance the Speech content in the Noisy speech signal, Digital audio effects are used. A Digital Expander generates an audio effect which operates on a low signal level and create more likely sound characteristics.

So energy depletion is another problem so to overcome this issues we need to find another sources like non conventional sources which are easily available as well as non pollutant & clean. Solar energy is well known source of renewable energy. In this paper by using sun tracking method with the help of photovoltaic system we can generate electricity. In this method of sun tracking we are considering the moveable PV panel which is dual axis. With the help of RTC based tracking and simple circuits of power electronics the system will strongly perform.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the scalp surface using metal electrodes and conductive media[6], and inhibits lots of information to different emotional states and the recorded data is very complex. In the present work EEG signal is used to detect emotions at different situations. The real emotions are detected which acts as a real indicator described by the human subject. In this paper, the EEG signals are analyzed for feature extraction using 'db4' wavelet using multilevel decomposition. 10 real human subjects real EEG samples are collected using standard International 10-20 Electrode placement system which is placed over an entire scalp of human subject and it is decomposed into 5 different EEG bands using Discrete wavelet Transform (DWT). Emotion detection is the task of emotional state like recognizing a person's happiness, fear, anger, confusion or deceit across both voice and non voice channels. Emotion detection is based on a set of conventional features which are extracted like energy, Power spectral density, from the EEG signals for classifying emotions and to identify the intensity level of different bands of EEG signal. Feature extraction results are obtained by using 'Bior 5.5' and 'db4' wavelet for signal decomposition and to obtain the accurate frequency bands and feature Classification is performed by obtaining an accuracy of 75% for normal patient and 65% for abnormal patient. © 2016 IEEE.",Bior 5.5; Discrete wavelet transform; Electroencephalogram; Emotion detection; Feature extraction,Brain; Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Frequency bands; Power spectral density; Signal detection; Signal processing; Spectral density; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Bior 5.5; Electrical activities; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Emotion detection; Feature classification; Feature extraction and classification; Multilevel decomposition; Signal decomposition; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Among these three, secret sharing is better in terms of efficiency. Secret sharing is a method to safely share data between numerous gatherings. Secret is isolated into pieces, distribute among gatherings, and recuperated by the approved arrangement of gatherings. Secure multiparty can be executed in two ways: Centralized and Distributed.

It is from this fact that the sciences of Micro-expression reading, body language analysis etc originated. A similar pattern is observed in the the linguistics of the choice of words of a person and his handwriting. Graphology (Handwriting Analysis) and Statement Analysis can also be a tool to gain an insight in to the psyche of the person. For example if a person uses the word never as a substitute for no in a yes or no there is a high probability of a suspicion of deception in the context.

It is the proper arrangement of goods, items or cargo into the available space of container. Due to improper arrangement of cargo and unavailability of proper optimization techniques the space gets wasted and damage of goods occurs in container. The proper arrangement and placement of the cargo is very difficult task today. To utilize the maximum occupancy of the container the optimization algorithms are required to design. The optimization algorithms, simple algorithm, LAFF (Largest Area First Fit) and LAFF algorithm with Weight consideration are proposed. All algorithms, simple algorithm, LAFF and LAFF with weight consider the dimensions of the cargo and container like base, height, width and weight. These algorithms help to plan and load cargo properly in a container and give the optimized solution for arrangement of cargo.

Higher voltages are important for the efficiency and reliability of the electrical transmission system as higher voltages results in less losses in terms of heat, better voltage regulation and thus raising the power utility at consumers end. Subjecting to such high voltages the power transformers are always vulnerable to high frequency surges generated either by the natural or external causes such as striking of lightning at its leading terminal or self generated over voltages within the system itself by the various switching operations and fault. Thus to avoid failures it is important to have adequate design consideration so that the heavy losses both in terms of economy and power interruption can be avoided. Therefore the insulation design is perhaps the most critical part involved in transformer manufacturing. Keeping these in mind, the work under this paper aims at resolving the problem of minor insulation of large power transformer and arriving at a better design structure thus, achieving a better voltage profile in terms of impulse voltage distribution. © 2016 IEEE.",EMTP software; HV winding; Impulse voltage; LVwinding; Surge; Transformer,Electric windings; Embedded systems; High frequency transformers; Insulation; Power transformers; Signal processing; Voltage dividers; Voltage regulators; Winding; Efficiency and reliability; Electrical transmission system; Impulse voltage; Large power transformers; LVwinding; Surge; Transformer; Transformer manufacturing; Electric power transmission,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Where digitization is applicable to every domain; no matter its technical or non-Technical. So there is a need of effective retrieval of data. Today people are finding some new retrieval schemes over the traditional query based retrieval systems. So moving towards content based approach is an hour's need. Some betterments are definitely needed to empower the Content Based approach. For content based video retrieval (CBVR) system, Block Truncation Coding (BTC) is one of the techniques to extract color features of a video. One more technique is there with improvements to BTC is Thepade's Sorted Ternary Block Truncation Coding (TSTBTC). Transform feature extraction is one more technique about extraction of the video. Right now only one feature can be targeted in a technique; in other words, there is no method which can be exposed to color as well as transform feature of a video. In other hand, Vector Quantization (VQ) is a popular technique for lossy data compression. If VQ is used with TSTBTC, it can deal with color features as well as transform features of a video. Because VQ is can be operated with hybrid features. This is first time when VQ is seen in CBVR.

This auscultation process is most commonly used by the doctors. Auscultation provides important information to diagnose abnormalities and disorders in the respiratory system to identify respiratory diseases. The measurement of the different subjects data and Permanent record of the ralated data is difficult to maintain by auscultation using a stethescope. The use of stethoscope for diagnosing abnormalities has many limitations which overcome with the use of digital signal processing technique. In this paper, the piezoelectric transducer linked with the mircophone, so as to pick up the respiratory sound signal and record it. Then through the audio input the further processing of the Signal was done in MATLAB. Bandpass IIR filter is used for the Signal processing such as respiratory sound signal filtering and to remove noise. Design technique of bandpass filter is proposed using various type of window function Hanning, Hamming, Blackman and Kaiser window. Fast forier transform is plotted to observe the frequency distribution o f a signal and which is useful for the computation of Power spectral density graph. Power spectral density graph is plotted to obeserve the frequency at maximum peak value of the waveform and the maximum frequency is calculated. Our objective is to determine that which window is showing better response with bandpass filter for respiratory sound analysis.

The aim of APDA is to reduce the network communication overheads through dynamic sub-network pruning to save the energy, minimize the unnecessary extra non relevant data transmissions. We construct tree rooted at base station BS. Mainly, proposed work includes three algorithms: 1) network formation using MST, 2) data aggregation using normalization, and 3) pruning technique with multi-cast communication. Aggregation tree includes dominator nodes (DN) which perform certain operations like data aggregation, multicast communication and pruning the sub network using normalized values in the range of 0 to 1 and at lower layer i.e. Inferior nodes (IN) sense the requested information and reports to its upstream DN nodes. The objective of APDA is to prolong the network lifetime and reduce query latency while reducing the communication runtime overheads.

There have been proposed many Time domain and Frequency domain algorithms with different computational complexity. Common artifacts in VAD are Front End Clipping (FEC), Mid Speech Clipping (MSC), over clipping and Noise detected as Speech (NDS). Performance of VAD is dependent on SNR between speech and background noise. Background noise could be either a wide band noise spanning entire speech frequency band or it might be a narrowband noise which does not interfere with the speech frequency band. Simple VAD methods based on short time energy and zero crossing detection fails to discriminate between speech frame and noise frame in low SNR environment. The frequency domain methods have higher accuracy in low SNR environments. In Single Frequency Filtering (SFF) approach instead of computing the complete FFT of the given audio frame, the power envelope of the spectrum at a discrete frequency interval 20Hz in the speech band of 20Hz to 4KHz are computed. The accuracy of the SFF VAD can be improved by applying an adaptive Noise Canceller prior to SFF VAD. The VAD decision of SFF approach at the transition from speech to noise and vice versa is improved to a remarkable extent by using an adaptive noise cancellation. Evaluation of SFF approach was done with Adaptive Spectral Subtraction based Noise Cancellation prior to SFF VAD. © 2016 IEEE.",Single Frequency Filtering; Speech frame detection; VAD; Voice Activity Detection,Embedded systems; Frequency bands; Frequency domain analysis; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Speech; Speech processing; Spurious signal noise; Adaptive noise cancellations; Adaptive noise canceller; Frequency domain algorithm; Frequency-domain methods; Single frequency; Speech frames; Voice activity detection; Zero-crossing detection; Speech recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The sensor networks can be used for various application areas (e.g., health, military, home). Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the apphcation and network architecture. There is a design trade-off between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. This paper provides method for clustering and cluster head selection to WSN to improve energy efficiency. It presents a comparison between LEACH and R-LEACH on the basis of the network lifetime. In this paper, we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system hfetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. Further, we modify one of the most prominent wireless sensor networks routing protocol LEACH as R-LEACH by introducing efficient cluster head replacement and inter cluster communication. Our R-LEACH, in comparison with LEACH performs better using metrics of cluster head formation, network hfe time. Finally a brief performance evaluation of LEACH and R-LEACH is undertaken considering metrics of throughput, network life. © 2016 IEEE.",Cluster Head; Leach; R-leach; WSN,Computer network performance evaluation; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Network architecture; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster head; Cluster-head selections; Communication overheads; Data dissemination protocols; Energy efficient routing; Intercluster communication; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks,"Sah, N.; PEC University of TechnologyIndia; email: nagsah@yahoo.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The performance analysis and controller design for SISO systems are easier than that for MIMO systems. These difficulties are due to the coupling or interactions between the various inputs and output variables. An input not only affects the output but may affect all the other outputs. Similarly, each input may also affect each output. Yk, k ? j. In many cases cross-coupling between the inputs and outputs is low and hence conventional SISO controllers may perform well. If a multivariable system exhibits strong cross-coupling between the various inputs and outputs, a multivariable controller has to be designed for achieving satisfactory performance. A popular approach to deal with control loop interactions is to design non-interacting or decoupling control schemes. The role of decoupler is to decompose a multivariable process into a series of independent single-loop sub-system. If such a controller is designed, complete or ideal decoupling occurs and the multivariable process can be controlled using independent loop controllers. © 2016 IEEE.",Controller; Coupling; Decoupler; Decoupling; Time delay; Zero Frequency Decoupler,Chemical reactions; Controllers; Couplings; Delay control systems; Embedded systems; MIMO systems; Multivariable systems; Signal processing; Time delay; Timing circuits; Control loop interaction; Controller designs; Decouplers; Decoupling; Decoupling controls; Multivariable controller; Multivariable process; Performance analysis; Process control,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In fixed-value impulse noise, the gray value is a fixed value, i.e., either 0 or 255 (example: Salt and pepper noise). Digital signal processing frequently involves some method for noise reduction over an image. The median filter is a non-linear digital filter, which is most popularly used to remove impulse noises. Many popular algorithms were presented which eliminates impulse noises present and maintains the fine details of the image. But, median filter fails to preserves the edges of the image by uniform modification of the noise affected pixels and the noise-free pixels. Also, the conventional filters work better only over images affected with low noise ratios and is very poor when the noise ratio reaches above 40%. The proposed de-noising algorithm uses an adaptive Gaussian filters for removal of salt and pepper noise. As conventional de-noising algorithm fails at high noise density and in preserving edges along with image details the proposed technique switches between mask sizes depending noise density. To preserve edges and details of the image Adaptive threshold is employed. Advantage of adaptive threshold filtering does not affect the edges or other small structures in the image. Hence this method is more efficient for the images with very high noise ratio and preserving edges. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive Gaussian filters; Salt and Pepper noise; System generator; Xilinx ISE,Adaptive filters; Bandpass filters; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gaussian distribution; Image acquisition; Image processing; Impulse noise; Integrated circuit design; Median filters; Optimization; Pixels; Pulse shaping circuits; Salt removal; Signal processing; Adaptive threshold filtering; De-noising algorithm; Design and implementations; Fixed-value impulse noise; Gaussian filters; Salt-and-pepper noise; System Generator; Xilinx ISE; Edge detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is basically a belief which one node has over the other when it receives information from it. This trust can either be on the node i.e. Entity Centric Trust which provided the information or this trust can be developed on information provided by the node, that is data centric trust or can be on both node as well as on information, that is combined trust.

A large collection of consumer reviews is now available on the internet. These reviews are very helpful to get quality information about the products. The consumer reviews are used as a feedback by the firms in their product development strategies and consumer relationship management. The consumer reviews contain valuable information still we face difficulties in information navigation due to their disorganized nature. The existing product aspect ranking framework automatically identifies important aspects of products from consumer reviews. There are two important observations to identify important aspects. The large number of consumers usually comments important aspects of the product and the consumers' opinion on those aspects have a great influence on their overall opinion about the product. It uses shallow dependency parser for identifying product aspects and sentiment classifier for determining opinion on those aspects. Finally, it uses a probability aspect ranking algorithm to infer the importance of aspects and ranks it as per their importance score.

Outputs of the two Flyback sub-parts are connected in series along with the normal Sepic converter output to result in a high positive overall output voltage. The Sepic converter portion acts as a passive clamp to both the Flyback converters. During the switch turn-off instant, the leakage inductor current of the Flyback transformers doesn't get interrupted. Hence, no spike can appear in the drain to source voltage of the switch. Due to the presence of the two transformers as the energy storing elements, the converter can be used for applications requiring higher power handling compared to the conventional Flyback converters. The proposed circuit has got the features like less leakage inductance transformers, less rating devices, low component count and provide high overall gain at high efficiency. In the subsequent sections of the paper, the working principle of the converter has been explained and validated through open loop simulations were done using Matlab-Simulink.

This definitely reduces network capacity in whole, but at the same time increases resource availability per user at a given state of time. In each cycle of resource allocation a feedback mechanism work to cater operational resource requirement. In this paper, we have investigated the performance of EUTRAN under different strategies of resource allocation using MATLAB, from different schedulers such as round robin, proportional fair, best channel quality indicator (CQI), max transmission point (TP) and a resource fair. We evaluate strategies for resource allocation under indistinguishable arrangement and conclude that performance comprehensively depend upon channel imperfection. © 2016 IEEE.",EUTRAN; LTE-A; Multi-point connectivity (Mu-PC); Scheduler,Complex networks; Embedded systems; Radio; Scheduling; Signal processing; Channel imperfections; Channel quality indicators; E-UTRAN; LTE-A; Multi-points; Radio resource allocation; Resource availability; Scheduler; Resource allocation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Though the noise variants are many, the impulsive noise in signal highly affects its quality. In this piece of work, speech signal is considered for enhancement that is contaminated with impulsive noise. Generally, hiccups create such type of noise due to tiredness or myoclonic problem of human subjects. Removal of this type of impulsive noise can enhance the speech signal and can be used in case of recognition, security and in the field of medicine. The popular recursive least mean square (RLS) algorithm has been used for this purpose.

In simple terms, substation maintenance is a regimen of regular preventative checks and actions carried out to ensure substations are kept in good working order. This process typically consists of a series of stringent visual and physical inspections and actions carried out according to a set schedule. All inspection and actions during substation maintenance should be accurately documented and stored for further reference. Substations are the most critical part of any electrical supply grid. Substation care is one of the most important parts of any electrical department's preventative maintenance schedule. These schedules generally consist of a tiered plan of minor and major maintenance events. Minor maintenance will seldom require any sort of power shut down although major events typically requiring short intervals of supply interruption. Routine or minor substation maintenance is usually carried out on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. It typically consists of visual checks and superficial cleaning only. Major substation maintenance involves more planning and is generally handled on a quarterly basis. In the case of industrial installations, these procedures are often carried out during plant maintenance shutdowns. Ancillary equipment such as amp and volt meters, control circuits, and transformers will also be given individual attention during this review. © 2016 IEEE.",Busbars; Capacitor bank; Capacitor voltage transformer; Circuit breakers; Control&Relay panel; Current transformer; Isolator; Lightning arrestors; Potential transformer; Power transformer; Station Battery charger; Station transformer; Wave trap,Busbars; Cleaning; Electric circuit breakers; Electric instrument transformers; Electric transformers; Embedded systems; Inspection; Plant shutdowns; Power transformers; Repair; Signal processing; Battery chargers; Capacitor bank; Capacitor voltage transformer; Isolator; Potential transformer; Station transformer; Maintenance,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A better approach to reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) in all the three L-L voltages of three-phase multi-level inverters is presented in this paper. It is a fundamental frequency switching strategy where the switching angles can be so selected such that THD in output L-L voltages is minimized to a great extent. In order to obtain most favorable switching angles, an optimisation algorithm using GA is applied to L-L output voltages of three phase multi-level inverters. From three-phase load view point, THD in L-L output voltage of three phase multi-level inverters is a major apprehension when compared to phase voltage. Keeping this in view, optimisation algorithm using GA is applied to L-L voltages (RY, YB, BR) of all the three phases of cascaded multi-level inverters for minimisation of THD. The number of levels in the output will be dynamic and is based on the switching angles chosen and accordingly variations in THD levels too. To support simulation results, hardware for producing triggering pulses of the switches are realized, with the switching times determined by the genetic algorithm and generated using STM32F04 DSP passing through a driver (IR2110) cabinet. © 2016 IEEE.",,Embedded systems; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Signal processing; Switching; Cascaded multi-level inverters; Fundamental frequency switching; Multilevel inverter; Output voltages; Switching angles; Switching time; Three-phase loads; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric inverters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To make an effective decision, decision maker needs relevant and meaningful information. But to retrieve meaningful information from such a huge database, decision maker needs background knowledge about the domain. Practically for a decision maker having background knowledge about each and every domain is not possible. Due to this meaningful information remains hidden in the database itself. Decisions made out using such irrelevant and meaningless information leads to irreparable damage and harm to the reputation of organization. Hence to retrieve the meaningful and relevant information, background knowledge about the domain is necessary. To solve this problem, ontology is used as a source of domain knowledge. By using ontology, meaningful information is retrieved from the database to help in taking decision. In proposed system, ontology is used to represent the background knowledge about the domain.

A Silent Speech Interface is a device that enables the communication to take place when voice is not present. In noisy environments, the SSI holds a promising approach for speech processing. In this project a system is developed which recognizes silently uttered words and performs specific tasks based on the recognized lip movements of the words. The method used is noninvasive. The system records video of the lip movements of the words/letter uttered silently. The recorded signal is analysed by extracting features using local binary pattern (LBP) operator and then detected using a kNN classifier. The system is trained and tested to recognize the word 'WATER'. When the word 'WATER' is uttered, lip movements are analyzed and the control signal is generated to initiate the robot to pick a water bottle from a specified location and place it at the predefined destination. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature extraction; KNN classifier; Local binary pattern (LBP); Silent speech interface,Bins; Bottles; Embedded systems; Feature extraction; Signal processing; Speech; Speech processing; Acoustic signals; Extracting features; K-NN classifier; Local binary pattern operators; Local binary patterns; Noisy environment; Recorded signals; Silent speech interfaces; Speech communication,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Most of these are related to how to secure the user authentication which is seen as a core requirement for the cloud computing system the personal authenticating data of user becomes susceptible to a variety of attacks like password guessing, denial of service (DOS), replay, man-in-The-middle, insider, and so on. As a result, there has been a wide range of techniques and methods proposed to prevent such attacks and provide sufficient security for the user authentication in the cloud system. Yet, some of the issues such as mutual authentication, verification, and the impossibility of freely password change still remain unsolved.

The same sorts of documents are grouped by performing clustering techniques. Similarity measuring is used to determine transaction relationships. Hierarchical clustering model generates tree structured results. Partitioned based clustering produces the result in grid format. Text documents are unstructured data values with high dimensional attributes. Document clustering group transforms unlabeled text documents into meaningful clusters. In the event of document grouping process, traditional clustering methods require cluster count (K). Clustering accuracy degrades drastically with reference to the unsuitable cluster count. It is observed that document features are automatically partitioned into two groups namely - discriminative words and non-discriminative words. In particular, discriminative words are only useful for grouping documents. The involvement of non-discriminative words confuses the clustering process and leads to poor clustering solution in return. A variation inference algorithm is used to infer the document collection structure and partition of document words simultaneously. Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model is used to partition documents in a way utilizing both the data likelihood and the clustering property of the Dirichlet Process (DP). Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Feature Extraction (DPMFE) is used to discover the latent cluster structure based on the DPM model and it is performed without involving the number of clusters as input. © 2016 IEEE.",Chinese restaurant process; Dirichlet process mixture model; Stick breaking process,Clustering algorithms; Embedded systems; Inference engines; Mixtures; Signal processing; Breaking process; Clustering properties; Clustering techniques; Dirichlet process mixture model; Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM); Hier-archical clustering; Similarity measuring; Traditional clustering; Cluster analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A sequence of such hits can lead to a type of brain malfunctioning called 'concussion'. Concussion alters the brain functionality when occurred for more number of iterations in accidents. It happens when a sudden blow is introduced to the head during a fall, hit or could be worse in case of accidents In this paper, we propose to measure the impact of a hit when a player or a biker or a construction site laborours head comes across a hit. The Force sensor measures the intensity of the hit and gives an output in terms of 'g' Force based on the threshold set. The Measured 'g' will help for further diagnosis of the patient. This diagnosis helps in the situation where a person cannot move his body and is in critical condition. The process is also automated to send the information. This module measures the Force intensity as well detects the longitude and latitude of the area where the hit took place by the help of GPS by using a 433 MHz Transmitter. A GSM module is also implemented to send an SMS to any nearby Hospital Authority or any concerned person displaying 'EMERGENCY!!!!

It is NP-hard to solve problems with partial information and few assumptions. Various meta-heuristic techniques are applied to optimize the solution; one among them is Tabu Search (TS) which gives solution nearer to the optimum with high speed and precision. Initially Tabu Search is applied to various combinatorial problems that have appeared in the operations research literature. Tabu Search relieves local search method from local optima problem, and start finding the solution from single point, finds application mostly in all areas in computer science including VANET, Software Development Effort Estimation, Quadratic Assignment problem, etc., for their efficiency.

Unfortunately, it will take long time for the process of full charging of a mobile phone battery and considering present generation mobile phones it is very much time taking process in to charge its battery because they are having a lot of functions need to be operated. so that The battery will be discharging quickly when mobile is working with multi functions. This process leads to be switched off the mobile. This problem is reduced with backup power banks. However, many disadvantages are present in these types of models. We can include more functions in mobile if we can able to provide power backup for long time by providing more space in the mobiles This is possible by two ways but both the ways are in opposite nature. Those are, long time power can be supply to mobile by increasing the size of battery, however this will not be a proper approach because to include more functions in mobiles the majority space in mobile will be occupied by battery. This problem can be rectified by providing alternative power to the battery continuously, hence small size battery will be sufficient to operate mobile with more features. This alternative power can be supplied by Photovoltaic (PV) cells and the possibility is to insert the PV cells on the battery. In this paper, the PV cells are used to charge the mobile battery and simulation results are presented with experimental results in various possible conditions. The proposed setup can be designed as an integrated chip, so the size of the charger will be reduced and the battery can be charged continuously from the solar power. It has been established that the performance of the proposed method is quite satisfactory during both in transient as well as in steady state is quite satisfactory under both MATLAB and experimental analysis. © 2016 IEEE.",DC to DC converter; Mobile battery; PV cells; Rechargeable battery; Voltage regulator,Cellular telephones; Charging (batteries); DC-DC converters; Electric batteries; Embedded systems; MATLAB; Mobile phones; Photovoltaic cells; Signal processing; Solar energy; Telephone sets; Voltage regulators; Alternative power; DC-to-DC converters; Experimental analysis; Innovative experiments; Integrated chips; Mobile battery; Mobile phone batteries; Pv cells; Secondary batteries,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The unwanted leakage energy of the transformer is managed by the passive clamp circuitry consisting of a diode and a capacitor and transferred to the output side electrically. We know that the Flyback converter power rating is limited due to its magnetic. In the case of the proposed converter, one portion of the total load power is sent from the input source. Another portion is sent to the load through the passive clamp circuit itself. Hence, the Flyback transformer handles lesser power than the total output power requirement. The voltage rating of the power electronic devices is less for the proposed topology. High voltage spikes do not appear across the switch. These features result in high efficiency of power conversion. The modes of operation of the proposed converter have been found out and the differential equations governing various states has been derived and solved. Plots of the variation of the efficiency and the gain of the converter have been obtained after detailed steady state analysis.

These dual band antennas find application in mobile terminals, such as cellular devices or portable laptops, Wi-Fi dongles. Antennas employed in such systems have certain requirements: High gain, stable and omni-directional radiation pattern, reduced interference. This paper presents a compact dual band monopole antenna suitable for 2.4/5 GHz WLAN application. The antenna is fabricated on an FR4 substrate of size 20 × 30 × 0.8 mm3 and consists of multiple meandering lines connected to the 50-Ohm microstrip feed signal line to generate the desired dual resonance frequencies. Two impedance bandwidths, for S11?-10 dB, of 240 MHz and 2570 MHz have been obtained from simulation results which show that the required bandwidths of IEEE 802.11b/g (2.4-2.485 GHz) and IEEE 802.11a (5.15-5.825 GHz) can be completely covered by the proposed antenna. Prototype of the proposed antenna shows good agreement between simulated and measured results. Improved bandwidth and nearly omni-directional radiation pattern of the proposed antenna at both resonance frequencies make it a viable choice for integration into modern portable devices. All simulations have been carried out using Ansoft's HFSS ver. 15.0. © 2016 IEEE.",Antenna structures; Dual band; Monopole antenna; WLAN,Bandwidth; Electric impedance; Embedded systems; Microwave antennas; Mobile antennas; Monopole antennas; Natural frequencies; Omnidirectional antennas; Resonance; Signal processing; Standards; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna structures; Dual Band; Dual-band monopole antennas; Impedance bandwidths; Next-generation wireless communications; Omnidirectional radiation pattern; Resonance frequencies; WLAN; Directional patterns (antenna),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Search can be considered as a universal problem solving mechanism in Artificial Intelligence world. Search is most essential as no models in the world are complete, computable and consistent. Solutions to the problem cannot be precomputed and many problems have to be tackled dynamically by considering the observed data. Search framework in Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into state space search, problem reduction search and game tree search. This paper concentrates on one of the aspect of state space search i.e., uninformed search. Uninformed search will be deprived of domain specific information. Search algorithm has to run without any additional knowledge. Different algorithms of uninformed search will be analyzed against time, memory, completeness and optimality.

The transience of mobile nodes in Vehicular Ad hoc A network (VANETs) renders topology control a great challenge. the existing edge connected topology control algorithms need to determine the value priori, but moving speeds of nodes are unpredictable, and therefore, these algorithms are not practical in VANETs. In the proposed method if node failure occurs the described algorithm automatically determines the appropriate alternate node based on the efficient values for the required graph, using Local information while ensuring the required connectivity ratio of the whole network. The results show that the dynamic method can enhance the practicality and packet transmission in undisturbed channel with the strong topology control algorithms while guaranteeing the network connectivity. © 2016 IEEE.",Cluster; INetwork strength; Mobility; Processing time etc; Topology control,Ad hoc networks; Carrier mobility; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Mobile ad hoc networks; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Topology; Cluster; Dynamic topologies; INetwork strength; Network connectivity; Packet transmissions; Processing time; Topology control; Topology control algorithms; Vehicular ad hoc networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

For the consumer expected performance of electrical vehicles proper selection of suitable electric motor is the first and important criterion. So in this studies selection of appropriate motor for electrical vehicle has been discussed based on tractive efforts requirements of vehicle and delivered by motor. Three leading candidates of traction motors as Induction motor (IM), Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and Switch reluctance motor (SRM) are compared for maximum speed, dynamic efficiency, material cost and fault reliability. Induction motors could be appropriate choice but still not satisfactory. Multiphase induction motor can be the better selection considering all the key factors.

Power Transformers are most important and critical component in electrical power transmission and distribution. To have a reliable electricity supply it is necessary to give considerable attention to maintenance of the transformer. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of transformer oil is one of the most effective power transformer condition assessment techniques to diagnose incipient faults. There are many interpretation methods for DGA diagnosis however all these methods rely on personnel expertise more than analytical calculation. As a result, various interpretation techniques do not necessarily indicate to the same result for the same oil sample. Furthermore, substantial number of DGA results fall outside the proposed codes of the existing ratio interpretation methods Furthermore, ratio methods fail to diagnose multiple fault conditions due to the mixing up of produced gases. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a new fuzzy logic approach to reduce reliance on expert personnel and to aid in standardizing DGA interpretation methods. The approach relies on incorporating all existing DGA interpretation methods into one proficient model. DGA results of 100 oil samples that were collected from different transformers of different rating and different life period are used to create the model. Conventional DGA interpretation methods are used to analyse the Together DGA results to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of each interpretation methods. Results of this analysis were then used to develop the proposed fuzzy logic model. © 2016 IEEE.",CIGRE ratio method; CO2 / CO method; Dissolved gas analysis; Dornenburg ratio method; Fuzzy Logic; IEC gas ratio method; Rogers gas ratio method,Computer circuits; Condition monitoring; Dissolution; Embedded systems; Gas chromatography; Gases; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Signal processing; Analytical calculation; Asset Management strategy; CO2 / CO method; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Dissolved gas analysis; Gas ratio; Interpretation methods; Ratio method; Fuzzy logic,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

College of Engineering, Bangalore, India","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier multiplexing technique used in many applications such as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Digital Audio Broadcasting Terrestrial (DAB-T) and Long Term Evolution (LTE). It provides high efficiency and low data loss in multipath environment hence there is a need for suitable modulation technique. Different modulation techniques in OFDM give different Bit Error Rate (BER) performance and spectral efficiency. Moreover Even after modulation the output of Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) gives large Peak Amplitude Power Ratio (PAPR) which poses a problem in amplifier efficiency and complexity in analog to digital converters. This paper aims at finding a suitable modulation scheme and efficient technique to reduce PAPR in OFDM, based on BER and bandwidth. Algorithms are implemented using MATLAB for different modulation schemes over AWGN, Rayleigh and Rician channel for WLAN application with 52 subcarriers. Random bits are generated such that there are 16 symbols, each symbol having 52 bits. In AWGN for 3db SNR 64-QAM gives BER of 0.23 and to achieve same BER, 64-PSK requires 25db SNR. Rician channel gives better performance compared to Rayleigh, where BER is 0.2965 for Rayleigh and 0.2714 for Rician thereby reducing it by 0.02. Using wavelet transform PAPR is reduced to 62% of that using FFT. © 2016 IEEE.",Bit Error Rate; Inverse Fast Fourier Transform; Linear Block Codes; Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing; Peak Amplitude Power Ratio; Quadrature Amplitude Modulation; Rayleigh channel Introduction; Rician channel,Analog to digital conversion; Bit error rate; Complex networks; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency division multiplexing; Frequency modulation; Inverse problems; Inverse transforms; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mathematical transformations; Modulation; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Radio broadcasting; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; White noise; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Inverse fast Fourier transforms; Linear block code; Power ratio; Rayleigh channel; Rician channels; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It plays prominent role in the decision-making process for investment and development of various mining projects and hence judicious selection of the assessment method is essential for making profitable investment. The grade and quantity of the ore varies with spatial coordinates and directions and thus spatial uncertainty has to be taken into consideration for improvement in estimation of minerals deposits. Traditional geostatistical approaches such as ordinary kriging (OK), Inverse Distance weighing (IDW) and object based approach are still being used for the purpose, but because of its limited capability of honoring the statistics up to the second order, they cannot faithfully represent the complex spatial variability of minerals deposit. The remarkable feature of various pattern recognition techniques to capture the inherent patterns in the complex data made them suitable for the geologic resource estimation. This paper describes the use of two distinct pattern recognition techniques: support vector regression and Gaussian process regression to assess the mineral grade of one of the Indian iron ore mines from eastern region of the country. The spatial coordinates and multiple types of lithology were taken as input variables and iron ore grade as an output variable. The comparative analysis of these models was carried out, and the results obtained were validated with traditional geostatistical method: Ordinary Kriging (OK). The various performance measures such as root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the different models. It is found that SVR and GPR provide significant improvement in resource estimation. © 2016 IEEE.",Gaussian process regression (GPR); Geologic Resource Estimation; Ordinary Kriging; Pattern Recognition; Support Vector Regression (SVR),Deposits; Embedded systems; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Interpolation; Inverse problems; Iron; Iron compounds; Iron mines; Iron ores; Lithology; Mean square error; Minerals; Ores; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Coefficient of determination; Decision making process; Gaussian process regression; Geostatistical approach; Ordinary kriging; Pattern recognition techniques; Resource estimation; Support vector regression (SVR); Pattern recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Reuse of partial results eliminates the necessity of matrix resizing in interpolation filter computation. A novel block-formulation is presented to share the partial results for parallel computation of filter outputs of different up-sampling factors. Using the proposed block formulation, a parallel multiplier-based reconfigurable architecture is derived for interpolation filter. The aspect of the proposed architecture is that, it does not require reconfiguration to compute filter outputs of an interpolation filter for different up-sampling factor. The proposed structure has regular data-flow and it has no overhead complexity for its reconfigurable feature unlike the existing structures. Besides, the proposed structure has significantly less register complexity than the existing structure and its register complexity is independent of the block-size. Moreover, the proposed structure can support higher input-sampling frequency than the existing structure. ASIC synthesis result shows that the proposed structure for block-size 4, filter length 32, and up-sampling factor 8, involves 13.6 times more area and offers 245 times higher maximum input-sampling frequency compared with the existing multiplier-less structure.

In this work, photonic crystal is realized by considering glass (VITRON-IG) as back ground material with periodic six numbers of air holes containing different percentages of glucose in human urine. The principle of estimation of glucose in urine is based on variation of photonic band gap of aforementioned structure. The output beam emerging from above said crystal structure containing different percentages of human urine depends on both absorption and reflection loss. Simulation result reveals that output energy increases from 0.719 eV to 0.722 eV with glucose concentration, which varies from 0 gm/dL to 10 gm/dL.

A video is composed of a large number of still images, and since images are taken at relatively short time distance, the two neighboring images are similar. It is known fact, that there is strong correlation between the adjacent images or frames. This correlation in the time direction is called the interframe correlation. This interframe correlation can be exploited and efficiently reduced to achieve compression. Out of the different compression techniques used for video data, the Lossy techniques provide high compression ratios. However, it must be kept in mind that, one has to compromise on video quality to have a lower data size (therefore computational time). As the compression ratio increases the size decreases and the quality degrades. The encoding at the server side and decoding at the receiver side also require computational resources, which have to be taken into consideration.

So the consumer is equipped with a net metering system to calculate the net electricity cost. Depending upon the peak/off-peak hours and availability of sunshine, the system will charge or discharge the storage to supply the demand.

In the present study we aimed to estimate the blood glucose concentration using cost effective non-invasive forearm capacitance measurement technique. This technique is based on the fact that glucose level affects the dielectric properties of blood and underlying tissue. Test procedures were performed on 10 healthy subjects with age ranging from 25 to 35 years in two phases using a designed parallel plate capacitor circuit. Forearm part act as a dielectric medium of parallel plate capacitor and 555 timer circuits is used to produce pulse waveform based on measured capacitance. In first phase, capacitance was measured after consumption of sucrose (table sugar). In second phase, capacitance was measured after consumption of artificial sweetener. A total of 25 trials were made during the whole testing process. We observed that as the blood glucose value increases, magnitude of measured capacitance value also decreases. Therefore the trend of measured capacitance obtained after sucrose consumption is similar to the trend which was already established in oral glucose tolerance (OGT) test. Hence our results are promising and show the potential of this technique in predicting in-vivo blood glucose concentration; however, further improvement of the accuracy of the device is needed by doing more trails. © 2016 IEEE.",Blood Glucose estimation; Capacitance; Dielectric; Non-invasive technique,Blood; Capacitance; Capacitance measurement; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties; Embedded systems; Signal processing; Sugar (sucrose); Sugar substitutes; Testing; Artificial sweeteners; Blood glucose; Blood glucose concentration; Blood glucose monitoring; Capacitance values; Dielectric medium; Noninvasive technique; Parallel plate capacitors; Glucose,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

For effective utilization of the total UWB spectrum, Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is a suitable candidate. To achieve the higher data rates and high capacity, both multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and coding techniques are exploited. Hence, a combination of MB-OFDM UWB and Alamouti Space-frequency block coding (SFBC) increases the capacity of UWB systems, achieves better diversity and coding gain and improves overall performance of the system. However, like OFDM, Alamouti coded MB-OFDM UWB signal is also suffering with high PAPR. A Selected mapping (SLM) technique is a one of the popular PAPR reduction technique for MIMO-OFDM systems. In this scheme, by rotating the original MIMO-OFDM signal by different phase sequences, different MIMO-OFDM symbol representations are generated and select the signal with minimum PAPR is transmitted. Hence, in this paper, the Alamouti coded MBOFDM UWB signal performance is analyzed and we are proposing a phase offset SLM scheme, to reduce the PAPR of the Alamouti coded MB-OFDM UWB signals. In our analysis, the performance measures are BER and CCDF. © 2016 IEEE.",MB-OFDM; SFBC; SLM and PAPR; UWB,Broadband networks; Codes (symbols); Embedded systems; Gain control; MIMO systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Coding techniques; High-speed wireless communication; MB-OFDM; Multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Performance measure; SFBC; SLM and PAPR; Space-frequency block coding; Ultra-wideband (UWB),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Most portable devices or handheld devices such as MP3 players, mobile phones, DSLR etc involves large number of multiplications with the several constants. FFT processors also involve large number of complex multiplication operations. As the multiplication operation takes more time they result in an increased delay in the FFT processors with larger area and energy consumption.

The sensor nodes deployed underwater uses wireless acoustic communication for propagation of data to the sink node. In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), the sensor nodes collaboratively work to explore and observe the unexplored remote area of sea. In this work, we propose event driven data gathering and routing in UWSN. The proposed work operates in three phases namely (1) event detection, (2) data gathering, and (3) routing. The proposed scheme is as follows. Upon detection of the event in the sea bed, the elliptical structures are created at the sea bed, mid of the sea and on surface layer. The radius of the elliptical structure is directly proportional to the impact of the event. At each elliptical structure, the Elliptical structure Head (EH) are elected for data gathering. EH of respective elliptical structure gathers data locally using horizontal links and sends it to center node of the ellipse. Bottom elliptical structure center node transmits its data to the upper layer (sea mid layer), in-turn it sends to the surface layer center node and in turn center node of the surface layer sends it to the sink node.

The system performance under variable solar irradiance condition has been observed to be invariable. It is found that UPQC is able to supply the harmonic power, so that harmonic components are not drawn from the supply system. The UPQC not only deals with harmonic power of the load but also deals with zero sequence power owing to imbalances in the power system.

The dynamic behavior of the SRM is analyzed in terms of the parameters such as the speed, current, inductance and torque. Based on the parameters, the motor speed is controlled and minimized the torque ripples. After that, the control signal is generated for controlling the speed of the SRM. Hence, this paper proposed an enhanced speed and current control with PWM mode to minimize the torque ripples. A recent optimization approach based current and torque control technique is proposed for regulating the speed of the SRM. Here, Ant-Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm based Fractional Order PID (FOPID) controller is utilized to analyze the speed and torque of SRM. To get the optimal results of FOPID controller, the gain parameters are optimized. The ALO algorithm is utilized to achieve the optimal gain parameter of the FOPID controller.

Some Information systems projects frequently fail and its reported as being between 50%-80% depending upon the project and study. If you define failure as the total abandonment of a project before or shortly after it is delivered, and if you accept a conservative failure rate of 5 per cent, then billions of dollars are wasted each year on bad software. Very little research has attempted an in-depth investigation of a number of failed projects to identify exactly what are the factors behind the failure.

The IETF proposed Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy network (RPL) is one of the most efficient protocols; still the standard RPL doesn't support mobility function. In this paper, a mobility enabled RPL protocol has been developed using enhanced hand-off and topology aware best parent selection scheme. Our proposed scheme deals with the best route selection process to be used for mobility assisted RPL for LLNs. The novelties of the proposed scheme can be characterized in terms of its enhanced hand-off process, optimized control messages, topology aware parent selection and quality sensitive DODAG formation, best route formation, congestion avoidance, and loop avoidance. The proposed mobility based RPL has exhibited better packet delivery ratio, delay, and number of DAOs required to achieve best route selection. © 2016 IEEE.",best route selection; DODAG formation; Hand-off optimization; Lossy Networks; RPL,Low power electronics; Signal processing; Topology; Transportation routes; Wireless sensor networks; Advanced researches; Communication application; Congestion avoidance; DODAG formation; Hand off; Lossy networks; Packet delivery ratio; Route Selection; Routing protocols,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Face image recognition systems used present variations in image quality, pose, illumination and resolution which help to improve the accuracy. In this paper we present attribute enhanced sparse codeword based face recognition and retrieval system which provide a better recognition performance when compare to the existing methods. Here the face is detected by the Active Shape Model Algorithm. It is good founded to uncontrolled pose images. Active Shape Models (ASMs) are statistical model of the shape of objects which iteratively deform to fit to an example of the object in a new image. We investigate the effectiveness of different attributes and important factors essential for face retrieval. By using LBP feature extraction model we are able to find better feature representations and achieve better retrieval results along with attribute sparse codewords.

Efficient energy utilization has been a primary concern in choosing routes from primary and secondary caches. Because of frequent movement of nodes energy consumption in MANET becomes a need. Generally failures of a route happen during the data transmission. Break age of routes leads to greater delay and increased delay. So there is an essential for a cost effective procedure for data communication. This paper proposes an Efficient Source Initiated Multipath Protocol based on Dynamic Routing Protocol (DSR) Protocol (ESIM-DSR). NS-2 is used for simulating the results. The observations show that ESIM-DSR has higher efficient transmission energy and residual energy routes than classical DSR protocol. Thus performance of ESIM-DSR is better than DSR in terms of packet delivery. © 2016 IEEE.,DSR; Energy; Multipath; TORA,Ad hoc networks; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routing protocols; Signal processing; Data-communication; Energy; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Multipath; Multipath protocols; Multipath routing protocols; TORA; Transmission energy; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Government has taken several methods for documents to scan and stored digitally for future use. Even though the documents are available in the digital format, but it is very difficult to search for a single word or phrase. Traditional optical character recognition techniques (OCR) and other text retrieval methods fail on these document images due to various types of noises. Word spotting will help the users to automatically search for a particular word/phrase in millions of such document images. In this paper we have proposed a word spotting technique for printed Telugu documents. Based on the word spotting technology, a collection of document images is converted into a collection of word images by word segmentation, and a number of profile based features are extracted to represent word images. Correlation and HMM model are applied for comparison of word images.

This paper introduces a simple but reliable algorithm for automatic detection of different features in an ECG signal by position-indices searching method (PISM). In the first step, the digitized ECG signals is denoised by moving average method. A differential threshold value is adopted to detect the indices of the positions of the R-peaks of the signal. Then by omitting the baseline wandering, the amplitudes of R-peaks are detected. In each cycle of normal ECG, all the features in ECG signal, namely P, Q, S & T-peaks, have their own amplitudes and positions with respect to their corresponding R-peak positions. In next step by taking the R-peak as pivot point, the amplitudes and position-indices of these features are detected by PISM. This algorithm is tested on a number of normal ECG records from PTB Database of variant ages and sex. The suggested algorithm shows very high sensitivity and positive predictivity. © 2016 IEEE.",Differential threshold; Ecg; Predictivity; R-peaks; Sensitivity,Biomedical signal processing; Electrocardiography; Embedded systems; Feature extraction; Online searching; Signal processing; Automated feature extraction; Automatic Detection; Cardio-vascular disease; Differential threshold; Moving average method; Predictivity; R-peaks; Sensitivity; Signal detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The BLDC motor can also be thought of an intermediate between a DC motor and a synchronous motor, which extracts the advantages of each of them and rejects their disadvantages. BLDC motor is inverter fed permanent magnet synchronous motor, having permanent magnet on rotor and trapezoidal or sinusoidal shaped back EMF. The BLDC motor employs a DC supply to stator phase winding of the motor by power devices, the commutation of phase is achieved by electronics commutation system instead of brushes and commutator. Hence the rotor position at six steps needed to achieve electronics commutation perfectly. The BLDC motor emerging as the dominant new technology in motion control. The paper builds simple, accurate and fast running model of BLDC motor drive in MATLAB/Simulink. They are especially beneficial in the situation where actual system does not exist.

They disrupt power supply and can result in calamitous situations such as blackouts. With the advent of modern technology, protective systems use computer based digital relays. The operation of relays can be made more reliable, accurate and fast by the use of better techniques which are immune to factors such as fault distance, fault inception angle and fault impedance. This paper presents one such unique and powerful digital relaying technique using wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA) for a parallel transmission line. Daubechies 4 (db - 4) wavelet is used as mother wavelet. The summation of the 6th level detail co-efficients obtained from the wavelet MRA filter bank are used for fault detection and classification. This paper explicates the need for this type of algorithm and its advantages. The reliability of this algorithm has been tested using a MATLAB/Simulink model of a parallel transmission line for a variety of faults, fault distances and fault inception angles and this validates the proposed digital relaying technique. © 2016 IEEE.",Digital Relaying; Fault Inception Angle (FIA); Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA); Parallel Transmission Line; Wavelet Transform,Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric lines; Electric power transmission; Embedded systems; Multiresolution analysis; Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Digital relaying; Fault detection and classification; Fault inception angles; Matlab/Simulink modeling; Modern technologies; Parallel transmission lines; Transmission line faults; Wavelet multi-resolution analysis; Fault detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

There is a requirement to know how numerous interventions can influence the recognized determinants of IT design, acceptance and usage. The statistical meta-analysis of several prototypes, particularly the technology acceptance model (TAM) studies have shown that it is a valid and robust model that has been very widely used, but which hypothetically has broader applicability. Though TAM has been considered to be one of the most widely used models in Information Systems and Technology, however, it is imperfect. There have been numerous researches in TAM involving students, professionals and general users. There are no studies till date that have considered into the trait of trust, perceived security, perceived privacy and information quality in e-learning technologies. To address this gap in the literature, the research work tries to draw from the existing research, particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and to develop a more robust model. The research work aims in calculating the validity of the data using Cronbach's alpha on the data set. Dimensionality reduction of the data is attempted by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method of Dimensionality reduction offers a robust way of factor identification by constructing Rotated Component matrices, and by thus proposing an efficient user-centric design model for software establishments and educational institutions in evolving e-learning solutions. The results of the proposed research would append up literature to the design and implementation phases of software engineering concepts. © 2016 IEEE.",E-learning; PCA.

The wireless sensor networks are being widely used in agriculture, home security, health care monitoring and traffic management systems. Usage of these systems has increased rapidly. An organization or institute can make use of the data obtained from various such sensor network systems for their analysis. Data obtained from such networks can be misused by any person if the systems are not well secured. Thus misuse of valuable information raises many problems for organization or institute. So to tackle this problem, we need to secure the sensor network systems from vulnerable attacks. In this paper, we propose a new novel approach for securing wireless sensor networks with different layers of security along with data encryption / decryption strategies.

This in turn leads to increase in environmental pollution and accidents which ultimately affects the safety, time consumed and money spent of the transport users. The solution to this critical problem is traffic flow prediction depending on which traffic control measures and traffic management can be done. Short term traffic flow prediction has become one of the hot topics of research in intelligent transportation system (ITS). It predicts the traffic flow count in the next time interval that usually varies in the range of five minutes to half an hour. This work presents the application of Support vector machine (SVM) for predicting the traffic flow in a short span.

In recent years, VANETs have drawn greater attention of researchers as well as academician due to their significant attractive features such as dynamic connectivity, self-organizing and no centralized administration. However, due to the extremely high mobility of vehicles, topology changes frequently. Hence may cause a high communication overhead for exchanging and updating the topology information. The most common solution adopted for this problem is the clustering. Many clustering-based protocols have been proposed which arrange vehicles into clusters and only the cluster heads need to communicate with cluster members and neighboring cluster.

Even when a wireless channel with high channel capacity is known, we still require to find superior techniques to achieve high speed data transmission or high reliability. Multiple antenna techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: diversity techniques and spatial-multiplexing techniques. The diversity techniques intend to receive the same information-bearing signals in the multiple antennas or to transmit them from multiple antennas, in so doing improving the transmission consistency. Diversity techniques are used to mitigate degradation in the error performance due to unstable wireless fading channels, for example, subject to the multipath fading etc. A basic idea of the diversity techniques is to convert Rayleigh fading wireless channel into more stable AWGN-like channel without any catastrophic signal fading. When the spatial-multiplexing Techniques are used, the maximum achievable transmission speed can be the same as the capacity of the MIMO channel; however, when the diversity techniques are used, the achievable transmission speed can be much lower than the capacity of the MIMO channel. Spatially multiplexed MIMO (SM-MIMO) systems can transmit data at a higher speed than MIMO systems using antenna diversity. However, spatial demultiplexing or signal detection at the receiver side is a challenging task for SM MIMO systems. This paper addresses the signal detection technique using maximum likelihood detection for SM MIMO systems. © 2016 IEEE.",Diversity; Maximum likelihood detection; Space time block coding,Antennas; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Embedded systems; Fading channels; Maximum likelihood; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multipath fading; Rayleigh fading; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Space-time block coding (STBC); Speed; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna diversity techniques; Broadband wireless access network; Diversity; High-speed data transmission; Information-bearing signals; Maximum likelihood detection; Multiple antenna techniques; Wireless fading channels; Signal detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In past, the size of power system is smaller; therefor the period of oscillation was not much greater than one second. Today large capacity of generator and system interconnected with the greater system inertias and relatively weaker ties results in longer period of oscillation followed by perturbation. These are the situations in which dynamic stability is concern. The enhancement of dynamic stability becomes very important for reliability and continuity of power system. Now power electronic based FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission system) devices are established to enhance the power transmitting capacity and also mitigation of oscillatory period of system at the time of fault. The case study of two area system is taken for analysis. Fault is created for observation of different parameter of machine and transmission system like rotor angle waveform, settling time, voltage of machine, active power of machine and transmission voltage. The different fault analysis says that FACTS controllers help to improve dynamic stability.

Such images are highly affected by noise from medical equipments like CTscan, ultrasound or MRI system. Impulse noise is mostly common type of noise interfaced with images. Denoising techniques like mean & median filtration are most used techniques to remove impulsive noise. Recently spatial adaptive masking is used to filter out high density impulse noise. This paper presents comparative results of some previously adapted mean & median filtration techniques for denoising of impulsive noise in medical images. Here we also propose a new technique in spatial adaptive masking filtration with improved PSNR of at least 2% for noise variance from 0.1 to 1.

These sensors are having tendency to fail, due to restricted battery life. The lifetime of sensor nodes has a greater dependency on its battery, as a result of failure of nodes the network lifetime will be reduced. In this paper, we propose a scheme for fault tolerance in wireless sensor networks by controlling the topology. The algorithm first detects the faulty node in the computed shortest path by considering the parameters mobility and buffer size. If the fault node is found, then the alternative shortest path excluding faulty node is identified for successful transfer of data. From the simulation results, it is observed that the more number of nodes will fail as there is increase in the mobility. © 2016 IEEE.",Fault Tolerance; Topology Control; Wireless Sensor Networks,Data transfer; Electric batteries; Embedded systems; Fault tolerance; Graph theory; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Topology; Battery life; Buffer sizes; Faulty node; Network lifetime; Shortest path; Topology control; Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Non-conventional energy is clean, pollution free and eco-friendly source of energy. Among the various sources of energy solar energy is the mother of all forms of energy. Due to high temperature Photovoltaic module experiences short effect (efficiency loss) and long effect (permanent damage) degradation. Therefore Cooling of Photovoltaic is one of the main concerns for enhancing the performance of the PV system. As per standard condition the efficiency of solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every one degree rise in temperature. The Cooling of Photovoltaic varies from individual cells to concentrator technology. In this paper experiments have been conducted with water cooling arrangement to study the efficiency factor of the PV module. Results shows water circulation on the front surface of module decreases the temperature by 5°C where as maximum power and efficiency increases by 2%. © 2016 IEEE.",Concentrators; Coolant; De-ionized; Fill factor,Coolants; Cooling; Embedded systems; Multiplexing equipment; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Signal processing; Solar energy; De-ionized; Efficiency factor; Efficiency increase; Fill factor; Non-conventional energy; Photovoltaic modules; Renewable Energy industries; Standard conditions; Solar cells,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This paper shows the design technique, parametric analysis, and simulated and fabricated results of parallel coupled transmission line filter operating at 2 GHz, the most used frequency in wireless systems. Microstrip and Stripline technologies are very common for implementation of bandpass and bandstop filters with required bandwidth up to a 20% with reference to central frequency. Design equations for calculation of coupled line parameters namely, space gap between lines, line widths and lengths are carried out so that analysis and numerical realization of the filter at 2 GHz could be approximated for microwave applications. For analysis, design, modelling and iterative simulations, the electrical specifications were determined as centre frequency of 2 GHz, bandwidth of 400 MHz, minimum attenuation of -20 dB and bandpass ripple of 0.5 dB. The dielectric material chosen to be used for this filter is FR4 having dielectric constant of 4.4 at this operating frequency and bandwidth. Scattering parameters S11 and S12 found after simulations of this filter in CST Microwave Studio are -34 dB and -1.54 dB respectively. The simulated results after insertion of rods inside the filter are achieved as -43 dB for S11 and -1.40 for S12. These results are verified with the measured results for the fabricated parallel coupled Microstrip band pass filter. Electro-mechanically submitting that this compact filter will provide a platform for the future young aspirants design and develop miniaturized filters for the microwave regime. © 2016 IEEE.",Bandpass filter; CST software; FR4; Microstrip; RF analyzer; Scattering Parameter,Bandpass filters; Bandwidth; Design; Dielectric materials; Embedded systems; Iterative methods; Microwave filters; Notch filters; Scattering parameters; Signal processing; CST microwave studio; Iterative simulation; Microstrip band-pass filter; Microstripes; Microwave applications; Minimum attenuation; Parametric -analysis; RF analyzer; Microstrip filters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this technique the measurements are grouped around the node clusters and processed independently, whereas in conventional state estimation whole power system network is considered as single entity and that is why the computational time required is considerably large. For real time EMS application state estimator is the integral part and it should be capable of giving the estimation of state variable in very short interval of time. To address this issue various techniques are developed such as dynamic state estimation, tracking, AI technique, multi-area technique, Two Level state estimation (TLSE) etc. In TLSE technique the power system network is sub-divided into smaller area such that each sub network can be processed independently. The publication [2] shows the application of VDSE on to TLSE. This paper presents the application of VDSE technique on to super node area level. A node along with its connected nodes is called node area and combination of two node areas is called 'Super Node Area'. By applying VDSE to super node area cluster the number of parallel processors required can be reduced drastically while keeping the computational time within limit.

The use of electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures is a good way to reduce the excitation of surface waves in geometries of printed antenna in order to alleviate the problem of mutual coupling. This paper examines the performance of a microstrip antenna integrated phased array in an EBG. A novel EBG array configuration is proposed, the bandgap characteristic of mushroom-like EBG has been studied, its spacing of characteristic band of the deletion of the surface wave is demonstrated by plotting the variations of the transmission coefficient S12 with the frequency and scatter diagram. The design of the antenna is verified by High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS), the simulation HFSS results show that the design approach EBG is a good candidate for a reduction of mutual coupling to certain frequencies between elements of the radiator, which in turn increases the directivity of the antenna. © 2016 IEEE.",Antenna arrays; Electromagnetic band gap structures(EBG); Multiple input Multiple output (MIMO); Mutual coupling reduction; Reflection phase; Specific Absorption Rate (SAR),Antenna arrays; Antenna phased arrays; Antennas; Electric excitation; Embedded systems; Energy gap; MIMO systems; Radar antennas; Radar signal processing; Signal processing; Surface waves; Synthetic aperture radar; Array configurations; Characteristic bands; Design approaches; Electromagnetic bandgap structures; Mutual coupling reductions; Reflection phase; Specific absorption rate; Transmission coefficients; Microstrip antennas,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 millions. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Non-motor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that this models can be used for early prediction of Parkinson's disease. © 2016 IEEE.",BayesNet; Biomarkers; Boosted Logistic Regression; Improved Accuracy; Machine Learning Techniques; Multilayer Per-ceptron; Non Motor Features; Prediction of Parkinson's Disease,Artificial intelligence; Biomarkers; Decision trees; Education; Embedded systems; Eye movements; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multilayers; Neurodegenerative diseases; Patient treatment; Regression analysis; Signal processing; BayesNet; Improved Accuracy; Logistic regressions; Machine learning techniques; Non Motor Features; Parkinson's disease; Diagnosis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The validation of Simulink model is carried out by comparing node voltages, total active and reactive power loss of balanced RDN with an existing vector distribution load flow (VDLF) method. The Simulink model is very helpful for proper sizing of distributed generation (DG) in RDN in considering DG as negative load. The proposed model is tested for 12, 15, 33 and 69-bus test balanced RDN. The variation in total active power loss (TPL) and total reactive power loss (TQL) for different penetration level of different types of DG are presented. At a given location, an optimal penetration level of DG to minimize total power loss is found by applying the proposed Simulink model for the 12-bus system. © 2016 IEEE.",Balanced radial distribution system; Load flow; Matlab/Simulink model; Optimal penetration of single DG; Power loss minimization,Complex networks; Electric load flow; Electric losses; Embedded systems; Reactive power; Signal processing; Load flow; Matlab/Simulink modeling; Optimal penetration of single DG; Power loss minimizations; Radial distribution systems; Electric load loss,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The identification relies on the performance of the classifier. In this paper identification of electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCI for motor imagery (MI) task is done through asynchronous approach. Transferring the brain computer interface (BCI) from laboratory state to real time application desires BCI to be functional asynchronously exclusive of any time constraint. In this case, ongoing brains activities are analyzed continuously irrespective of state i.e. control or non-control. The k-means is the most commonly used and one of the best clustering technique. With k-means, there is a possibility of convergence to the local minima. In literature, it is reported that k-mean modified with optimization techniques have able to address this problem by avoiding premature convergence of local minima. In this article, we have used algorithm-specific parameter-less Jaya optimization to select the initial cluster for k-means. Though enhancement in the accuracy is marginal, it is the speed which makes Jaya based k-means to be an obvious choice for the problem under consideration, i.e. classifying motor imagery task.

Requirement elicitation is often a significant activity which explores stakeholder's requirements. The difficult task for an analyst throughout the activity is to make sure effective communication with the users. The common causes for errors in systems are due to poor communication between user and analyst. Another flaw that happens in elicitation is poor identification of the stakeholders of the system. This paper proposes an elicitation tool which helps the user to visualize their requirements and specify it more clearly and precisely. Within the planned paper we are giving importance to proper identification of stakeholders using the StakeRare method proposed by Soo Ling Lim and etal. Identifying the appropriate stakeholders is equally important as eliciting the correct requirements of the system.

In sharp contrast to digital technology where Moore's law reigns, a fundamental law of physics constrains the ability to realize electrically small antennas that are both efficient and broadband. Software defined radio is defined as a radio in which some or all of their functions are software defined. The use of SDRs to make communications has enabled the design of intelligent radios called as Cognitive radio(CRs), by making communications re-configurable at lower layers of the networking stack. The major challenge is to design small antennas which can be operated at the large number of frequency bands. By tuning/switching the resonant frequency, single antenna can operate at different band of frequencies.

Most of the steganography methods hide the secret data into the insignificant parts of the cover image. But in Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) Steganography methods, the secret data are embedded into the differences of adjacent pixels. This pair wise modification mechanism in cover image increases the histogram distortion. In order to reduce this histogram distortion and also to improve security, capacity and quality of steganography image a new Block Based Octal Pair Pixel Value Differencing Steganography Method (BOPVD) is proposed. The proposed BOPVD method mainly focuses on range tables and secondarily on pixel pair differences. Most of the existing PVD methods use the design of Wu and Tsai's range table. But the proposed method use new range table is much meaningful and also increases the security level in embedding and extracting of secret data. The proposed method uses 8-neighborhood pixels for embedding purposes. The cover image is split into 3×3 blocks. These blocks are randomly chosen for embedding so that it will increase the security and capacity of the proposed method when compared to other PVD methods. An experimental result of RS steganalysis reveals that the proposed method has resistances to steganalysis attacks and also better embedding efficiency with good visual image quality. © 2016 IEEE.",Data Hiding; Embedding Payload; Histogram; Pixel Value Differencing; RS Steganalysis; Steganography,Embedded systems; Graphic methods; Signal processing; Steganography; Data hiding; Embedding Payload; Histogram; Pixel-value differencing; RS steganalysis; Pixels,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The improvement of stability will be achieved by controlling the reactive power flow in the line [3]. The Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices have been proposed to control the power flow in transmission lines & to regulate the bus voltages in electrical power systems resulting in an increased power transfer capability, less system losses and improved stability[8]. This summary presents the implication of adding various FACTS controllers such as a Static Var Compensator SVC, TCSC(thyristor controlled series capacitor) and UPFC(Unified power flow controller) etc. So a power flow program using MATLAB finds the steady voltage and angle at each bus and corresponding for a given system and finds the load ability margin of power system with FACTS devices.

Studies claim that there will be the existence of billions of internet connected devices in coming years. The small size and limited processing power of many connected devices could inhibit encryption and other robust security measure. Here cryptography plays a pivotal role. Also most of the devices available in the market today are resource constrained. Hence cryptographic solutions must be easy to implement and have high performance on a wide range of severely constrained devices. The relatively new field of lightweight cryptography provides significant advantages over existing algorithms when addressing security issues for highly constrained devices. In this project a detailed study of LBlock block cipher is done which is a lightweight cipher in both hardware and 8-bit platforms and an IP core is developed. The block size of LBlock is 64-bit and the key size is 80-bit and it can achieve competitive hardware and software performances when compared with other known lightweight block ciphers. The security evaluation shows that LBlock can achieve enough security margin against known attacks such as differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, impossible differential cryptanalysis and related-key attacks etc. LBlock cryptocore is designed, build and characterized for the efficient implementation in low resource devices. It can serve as a benchmark for the hardware design engineers to model devices that utilizes lightweight characteristics.

Face detection is one of the tedious job to achieve with very high accuracy. In this paper we proposed a method that combines two techniques that is Orthogonal Laplacianface (OLPP) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The formula for the OLPP relies on the Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) formula, which aims at finding a linear approximation to the Eigen functions of the astronomer Beltrami operator on the face manifold. However, LPP is non-orthogonal and this makes it difficult to reconstruct the information. When the set of features is found by the OLPP, with the help of the PSO, the grouping of the image features is done and the one with the best match from the database is given as the result.

The present growth of such renewable energy sources has shown an exponential increase in on-grid generation systems. The high penetration of such systems help a grid to effectively meet its load requirements during an irregular demand but also create some disturbances in grid due to frequent addition and detachments of loads/sources. The renewable energy sources that usually works in on-grid mod is to be attached and cut down from the grids without creating disturbances in stable grid. Another important requirement is the effective load management with less transmission losses.

The PSM scheme uses orthogonal pulses for data transmission as reported in the UWB literature. It is also known that the pulse geometry can change significantly by passing through a filter. This filter can be represented as an amplifier, transceiver antenna effect, pulse shaping filter, frequency selective pulse shape distortion, multipath channel and other system model effects. In this paper, theoretical analysis of the bit error rate (BER) performance of filtered 2-ary PSM signal has been carried out and verified with simulation results. Due to filter effect, the transmitted pulses are no longer orthogonal at the receiver, therefore design of the matched receiver is complex. In literature, a non-matched receiver is suggested, which is valid only for composite Hermite pulses (CHP) and has high bit error probability. A simple non-matched receiver for orthogonal pulses for PSM scheme in UWB communication is proposed, which is valid for CHP and other orthogonal pulses.

In this paper, USRP testbed has been developed to analyze the performance of cumulant based AMC in real radio environment for BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM modulation schemes. In the proposed testbed, the received signal is either uniformly sampled at Nyquist rate or non-uniformly sampled at sub-Nyquist rate and subsequently reconstructed. For non-uniform sampling (NUS), multi-coset sampling and orthogonal matching pursuit based reconstruction approach is realized. Experimental results, for various modulation types, antenna gains and various distances between transmitter and receiver, show that performance of AMC does not degrade significantly with NUS given that received signal is approximately sparse in frequency. © 2016 IEEE.",,Cognitive radio; Fading (radio); Frequency bands; Modulation; Quadrature phase shift keying; Quality of service; Radio transmission; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Testbeds; Automatic modulation; Experimental analysis; Modulation schemes; Nonuniform sampling; Opportunistic spectrum access; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Transmitted signal; Transmitter and receiver; Quadrature amplitude modulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Cooperative spectrum sensing improves reliability in detection of underutilized spectrum by fusing the decisions of local CR sensors. Local CR sensors use two thresholds, ?1 and ?2 (with ?2 &gt; ?1). If the sensed energy is greater than ?2 or less than ?1 then with complete certainty local sensors decide for the presence or absence of primary user (PU) respectively. The difference between ?2 and ?1 defines the ambiguity region, i.e., ?th = ?2 - ?1 in which local CRs are unable to decide the presence or absence of PU. In this work local sensors report the decision along with situation in which sensed energy falls in ambiguity region. In our analysis we use majority rule at the fusion center and compute an analytical expression of average probability of sensing error as a function of width of ambiguity region, i.e., ?th. Using the derived analytical expression and by simulation we show that there exists an optimal value of ?th for which the probability of sensing error is minimum. © 2017 IEEE.",Ambiguity region; Cooperative sensing; Double threshold; False alarm; Spectrum hole,Cognitive radio; Signal detection; Signal processing; Ambiguity region; Cooperative sensing; Double threshold; False alarms; Spectrum holes; Spectrum analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Such technology can be used in psychology, neuro therapy, and for real-time patients monitoring. One such off-the-shelf device is Neurosky MindWave headset. In this paper, it is utilized to measure electrical activity of user's forehead. The collected data in voltage is wirelessly transmitted to a computer for further processing. After processing the EEG data, signals were categorized to requisite frequency bands of brain waves for feature extraction. The collected signal can be used to differentiate between meditation and attention activities. Examples of attention activities are reading, problem solving, etc. Meditation level obtained directly from MindWave was not observed to be a good feature for classification of different brain activities. The two psycho-physiological states, attention and meditation are of interest to psychological therapies.

When there is disturbance in vocal cord function, there is notable change in source characteristic. Despite the technological advances in the medical field, the voice pathologists use endoscopic methods to view the vocal cord flap movements for patients with infections and disturbances in vocal cords which are painful. This work is an alternative for classifying pathological voice from normal voice by evaluating the jitter and shimmer variations in the speech signal of an affected person. When there is any distortion in voice, it is reflected in the source characteristics. Pitch being the fundamental source characteristic, analyzing pitch helps us classify pathological voice from normal voice. Jitter and shimmer are derived characteristics of pitch. The glottal closure instants are better representatives of source compared to pitch. In this work, we have explored using the glottal closure instants to calculate the jitter, shimmer and other speech parameters instead of the pitch period. Analyzing these jitter and shimmer parameters for various pathological voices and normal voices help us to classify them.

Among the various wireless domains, Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Networks (WDSN) pose a good support to the dynamics that arise when the nodes are induced with mobility. In the Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Network (WDSN), major consideration is on utilizing the energy efficiently among the mobile nodes. Various techniques are used to attain energy efficiency in Zigbee WDSN. Among them, clustering the nodes is one of the best methods, since they aim at reducing the energy dissipation and increasing the life span of the network. Hence, in this paper, the performance of Zigbee WDSN using clustering scheme is done by considering the nodes with mobility and compared with performance of Zigbee WDSN using non clustering technique. The proposed work is summarized as follows: the network is deployed as clusters and the remaining energy of the node is determined by utilizing clustering protocol. In each cluster, the clustering protocol opts for the node with the maximum remaining energy as the head of that cluster. Then STR algorithm is utilized to route the sensed data from the member nodes to the cluster head. Hence, the clustering technique and STR, route the information through the shortest path paving the way for enhanced average residual energy and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The simulations are done by using ns2 and performance metrics such as average residual energy and PDR are computed and analyzed for non clustered and clustered method. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; residual energy; STR; WDSN; Zigbee,Cluster analysis; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Average residual energy; clustering; Clustering techniques; Dynamic sensor networks; Packet delivery ratio; Performance analysis; Residual energy; WDSN; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The aim of this paper is to realize different types of combinational circuits like full-adder, full-subtractor, multiplexer and comparator using reversible decoder circuit with minimum quantum cost. Reversible decoder is designed using Fredkin gates with minimum Quantum cost. There are many reversible logic gates like Fredkin Gate, Feynman Gate, Double Feynman Gate, Peres Gate, Seynman Gate and many more. Reversible logic is defined as the logic in which the number output lines are equal to the number of input lines i.e., the n-input and k-output Boolean function F(X1, X2, X3,..., Xn) (referred to as (n, k) function) is said to be reversible if and only if (i) n is equal to k and (ii) each input pattern is mapped uniquely to output pattern. The gate must run forward and backward that is the inputs can also be retrieved from outputs. When the device obeys these two conditions then the second law of thermo-dynamics guarantees that it dissipates no heat. Fan-out and Feed-back are not allowed in Logical Reversibility. Reversible Logic owns its applications in various fields which include Quantum Computing, Optical Computing, Nano-technology, Computer Graphics, low power VLSI Etc., Reversible logic is gaining its own importance in recent years largely due to its property of low power consumption.

Detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma and Edema are the ones in which OD detection finds the meaning and need. The method proposed here introduces a unique concept of fractal analysis in its own way, exploiting the geometric structure of eye called Pixel Based Multi Fractal Analysis (PBMFA). At the very outset the retinal fundus images are pre-processed employing a modified Contrast Limit Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method. Furthering Mean Based Localization is carried out on the pre-processed image to locate the Region of Interest (ROI) over which further processes are carried out helping in improvising time complexity and efficiency of the algorithm developed. Modified Canny Edge detection leveraged with Gabor operator is performed over the ROI located, resulting in extraction of blood vessels from the retinal image. Pixel Based Multi Fractal Analysis is done locating the origin of vascular tree (center of the OD), based on the fact that it carries highest fractal dimension. This helps us locate the center most accurately followed by which OD of the retinal image is traced. This algorithm was implemented on DSK6713T making it a real time system and also an end product ready. Hardware implementation results in improvisation of the time complexity of the system too. An evaluation of the proposed algorithm was run over a set of 50 images each from STARE, MESSIDOR and DRIVE projects, containing images from both normal and pathological subjects. Detection and tracing of Optic Disc was found to be accurate up to 98.66%. Abnormal cases like expansion OD in the final stage of diabetic retinopathy were also detected successfully. © 2017 IEEE.",CLAHE; Gabor Filters; OD; PBMFA; ROI,Blood vessels; Edge detection; Eye protection; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Gabor filters; Hardware; Interactive computer systems; Ophthalmology; Pixels; Real time systems; Signal processing; Adaptive histogram equalization; Canny edge detection; CLAHE; Hardware implementations; Optic disc detections; PBMFA; Retinal fundus images; The region of interest (ROI); Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Microstrip patch antenna is one such type that satisfies the above requirement. But the two main factors of an antenna namely the gain and the bandwidth are low for patch antennas. Usually the gain range of patch antenna is 1-2dB. The most straightforward way of increasing these factors involves the use of low dielectric substrate with increased thickness, but this inevitably leads to surface wave generation. As a result, sensible substrate thickness has to be employed. This paper presents pentagon shape patch antenna with probe feed for three different dimensions.

Many novel algorithms continue to be proposed to achieve this objective. A survey of the literature also suggest that uneven clustering with less nodes closer to the base station achieves greater efficiency than same number of nodes in all clusters. This is due to larger overheads for the nodes closer to the base station. This work proposes a novel K-Means L Layer algorithms which leads to the creation of clusters with lesser number of nodes closer to the base station as opposed to the ones far away from it for randomly deployed nodes. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the K Means algorithm which provides even clustering.

It has a major role in verifying records to explore links and matches between a suspect and a crime. Fingerprints are also used for security reasons, such as an entrance control at important buildings. But the quality of fingerprint images can easily get degraded by skin dryness, wet, wound and other types of noises. Hence denoising of fingerprint images is a necessary step in systems for automatic fingerprint recognition. This paper suggests a 3-stage process for the removal of noise from fingerprint images, through exploring external correlations and internal correlations, with the help of a set of correlated images. Internal and external data cubes are built for each noisy patch by discovering identical patches from the corresponding noisy and internet based images. External denoising in the first stage is done by a graph based optimization method and internal denoising is done by means of a frequency truncation process. Internal denoising results and external denoising results are combined to obtain the preliminary denoising result. The second stage performs filtering of external and internal cubes and the fused result is in turn passed to the third stage. In the third stage, an image enhancement technique is carried out to obtain the final denoised result.

The occurrence count of each color pixel represents the color information of those quantized images. This technique is tested over Wang's database of 10 different category images. The distance measure of this feature between the query and database image are calculated. Then, the proposed method performance is evaluated using average precision and recall. Moreover, the proposed method is a benchmark against the state-of-the-art color feature extraction methods and gives approximately 6.3% to 18.05% and 7.54% to 14.52 % high precision and recall than the conventional techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",Distance measure; HMMD color space.

Many wall climbing robots are designed and shaped for few decades, but still, the underlying problems for the wall climbing are faced by the designers. Wall-climbing robots consist of a two mechanism, one is link and other is suction mechanism. In link mechanism there are two joints I-joint and T-joint, Where I-joint can rotate about its axis, T-joint can rotate about 180, Both the joints give the ability to rotate in clockwise and anticlockwise direction, which helps the robot to have a good transient mechanism between the horizontal wall to vertical wall. Based on these link mechanisms static and dynamic analysis were carried out to find the stress and strain developed in the joint during the motion. To achieve the suction mechanism, suction cups are placed on the suction base in a triangle shape and three suction cups are employed. Based on the weight of the robot load distribution is calculated. Both the static and dynamic analysis is performed using the software Ansys R15 and Inventry15. © 2017 IEEE.",dynamic analysis; inspection; robot; simulation; static analysis; transit mechanism; wall climbing,Dynamic analysis; Inspection; Intelligent robots; Robot applications; Signal processing; Static analysis; Load distributions; Model and analysis; simulation; Static and dynamic analysis; Stress and strain; Suction mechanism; Wall climbing robot; Wall-climbing; Robots,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The proposed system develops a prototype using blink as a solution to prevent CVS. The first part of the work captures video frames using web-camera mounted on the computer or laptop. These frames are processed dynamically by cropping only the eyes. The algorithms performed on the eye-frames are direct pixel count, gradient. Canny edge and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG).

Since robots understand only RCL (Robot command language), we need a system which converts natural language commands into RCL. We use a semantic parser to address this problem of converting natural language commands to RCL that can be readily implemented in a robot execution system. Our system gets the natural language command from the user and converts it into RCL using tagging approach. This tagging operation is implemented using a trainer, which uses Hidden Markov Model approach. Using this tagged command the Parser builds the RCL. Then the RCL is converted to configurations which is the co-ordinates of the objects in a given spatial context. The validation of these configurations is performed using robotic simulator. We have used an annotated dataset to compare and evaluate our approach.

A scene is a view of real world environment with multiple objects and surfaces in a meaningful way. Objects are compact and act upon whereas scene are extended in space and act within. The visual information can be given with many features such as Colors, Luminance and contours or in the form of Shapes, Parts and Textures or through semantic context. The goal of scene understanding is to make machines look like humans, to have a complete understanding of visual scenes. Scene understanding is influenced by cognitive vision with an involvement of major areas like computer vision, cognitive engineering and software engineering.

The most common problem in recognizing a face arises due to pose variations, different illumination conditions and so on. The main focus of this paper is to recognize whether a given face input corresponds to a registered person in the database. Face recognition is done using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique in AT & T database with an inclusion of a real time subject to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The feature vectors generated by HOG descriptor are used to train Support Vector Machines (SVM) and results are verified against a given test input.

These web services can be selected statically during design-time or dynamically during run-time. The functional and non-functional QoS requirements are typically captured in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) that is mutually agreed between the service provider and the service consumer. Whenever an SLA violation happens, the service provider incurs a penalty. In order to minimize such penalties, the application that is built through a design-time composition of web services needs to be monitored. Whenever a violation of SLA is predicted, those statically composed web services are dynamically reconfigured. This is called as dynamic reconfiguration in SOA. In this case, even the alternate service selection happens at design-time itself. On the other hand, whenever the web services needed for an SOA application development are selected and composed dynamically at run-time, it is called as dynamic composition. The turnaround time involved in both these approaches for mission-critical applications with stringent SLA requirements is compared. It has been inferred that the dynamic reconfiguration approach not only maintained the turnaround time always within the accepted limits, it also incurred only less overhead when compared to dynamic composition approach. © 2017 IEEE.",Aspect based fragment substitution; Dynamic composition; Dynamic reconfiguration; Patterns; Quality-of-Service; Service level agreement; Service-oriented architecture,Dynamic models; Information services; Quality of service; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Signal processing; Turnaround time; Websites; Application development; Architectural style; Business to business; Dynamic composition; Dynamic re-configuration; Mission critical applications; Patterns; Service Level Agreements; Web services,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives. © 2017 IEEE.",Cardiovascular disease; Diabetic mellitus; Heart Rate Variability (HRV); Hypertension; Internet of Things (IoT); Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT); Transport Level Security (TLS); Zigbee,Cardiology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Heart; Hospital data processing; Monitoring; Remote patient monitoring; Risk assessment; Signal processing; Zigbee; Cardio-vascular disease; Diabetic mellitus; Heart rate variability; Hypertension; Internet of Things (IOT); Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT); Transport Level Security (TLS); Internet of things,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Recent days lower back pain in human being increases and so the lumber spine pathology detection becomes a predominant research area in Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system. In the process of lumbar spine pathology detection, the segmentation of the Intervertebral Disc (IVD) is the major step as it identifies the IVDs or the boundaries of the IVDs either normal or abnormal in images. When the axial or the sagittal View of lumbar spine MR image is given as input, this proposed work segments the IVD in both the axial and sagittal views. The segmentation of IVD is a four stage process. First, Expectation-Maximization (EM) segmentation is performed on the MR Image. EM segmentation yields an advantage over K-means with the case of the size of clustering. The second stage is to carry out the morphological operators and third, apply edge detection method and obtain the edges. The final stage is to remove unwanted objects from the obtained output image. If this proposed segmentation is utilized as part of the CAD, the experts will be benefited for localizing the IVD and to diagnose the IVD disease. © 2017 IEEE.",Computer Aided Diagnosis; EM segmentation; Intervertebral Disc; Lower back pain.

Using PO device, required medical data is acquired using the photoplethysmographic (PPG) data utilizing PPG sensors attached on forehead/ to finger/at earlobe of the patient and then Ratio parameter (R) is computed pertaining to amplitudes of acquired red and IR PPG signals. Further, 'R' is used to estimate oxygen saturation levels with the help of calibration curve. Subject movements while recording the medical data may result in erroneous estimation of required estimation parameter and in turn may result in wrong diagnosis by the clinician. Reduction of Motion Artifacts (MA) component from raw PPG data recorded may guarantee error-free measurement of oxygen blood saturation level (SpO2). MA's can be removed from raw PPG signal (corrupted) using band pass filtering method, but the persisting in-band noise component cannot be removed. In this paper, authors propose a filtering method using tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to remove MA components. Advantage of TQWT sytems from the fact that, the realization of practical narrow band pass filter with a specific Q-factor value can be designed, which motivated the authors to use for this application. Experimental results have shown a good acceptance for the proposed method as the MA reduced PPG signals obtained are having efficient morphological features. SpO2 is estimated from MA reduced PPGs by utilizing the calibration curve. The superiority of proposed technique has been proved by comparing the experimental results with results obtained using basic least mean squares (LMS) method. Signal data can be acquired with different MA components (bending, horizontal and vertical movements of patient's finger) is considered for experiment analysis. Obtained SpO2 parameter calculations proved the efficacy of estimation technique in measurement of reliable and accurate SpO2, helpful for medical diagnosis. © 2017 IEEE.",Motion Artifacts (MA); Photoplethysmographic signals (PPG); Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT),Bandpass filters; Biomedical signal processing; Blood; Calibration; Diagnosis; Intensive care units; Least squares approximations; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Oxygen; Photoplethysmography; Q factor measurement; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Error-free measurements; Least mean squares methods; Morphological features; Motion artifact; Narrow-band pass filters; Oxygen saturation levels; Photoplethysmographic signals; Q-factors; Parameter estimation,"Ashoka Reddy, K.; Dept. of ECE, KITSIndia; email: reddy.ashok@yahoo.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Currently we are developing a Small Organ Imaging Gamma Camera (SOIGC) for imaging small organs with higher spatial and energy resolution. We present here a novel 'SoC' based real-time medical image processing tool for evaluation and quantification of Thyroid Uptake Ratio derived from Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).The Thyroid Uptake Ratio is a diagnostic index used extensively to assess Thyroid's hormonal activity obtained by quantifying the intensity of the segmented SPECT images which are conventionally done on expensive propriety tools. In contrast to these, our lower cost SoC tool based on DSP architecture offers a higher speed image segmentation process with co-relating performance. Thus, it also eliminates the need for higher computing resources on the host machine by using a Hardware accelerator called 'Pipeline Vision Processor' of an optimized Dual Core Digital Signal Processor. This architecture offers a high performance enhanced infrastructure with large on-chip memory and reduces the overall bandwidth requirement leading to accelerated imaging. We have cross-validated the performance of this tool by evaluating 27 medical case studies with thyroid medical history. As compared to diagnosis by propriety SIEMENS software or segmentation tools based on MATLAB, our hardware accelerated approach has shown a drastic reduction of computational time of about 250% with superior correlation. This SoC tool can be extended and realized for various other Medical Imaging procedures like Kidney's Glomerular Filtration Rate and Myocardial Perfusion studies of Heart. © 2016 IEEE.",Digital Signal Processing (DSP); Medical Imaging; Pipelined Vision Processor (PVP); System on Chip (SoC),Biomedical equipment; Computer hardware; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Hardware; Image processing; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Pipeline processing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; Single photon emission computed tomography; System-on-chip; Bandwidth requirement; Computational resources; Digital signal processing (DSP); Glomerular filtration rate; Hardware accelerators; Image segmentation process; System on chips (SoC); Vision processor; Integrated circuit design,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

It can be achieved by various techniques according to applications and required accuracy. Feeder points at various locations of electrical substation play important role in reduction of noise from the supply voltage. However this is of less amount and considerable for general applications. In some industrial applications, this may cause a large loss due to the presence of noise. So for controlling the accuracy one can design a system which overcomes the problems arising due to noise. Using MATLAB software it is implemented for detection and identification. It has various algorithms like KNN, SVM and RBF. SVM is the powerful tool in MATLAB for identification and Classification of voltage signals, images as well as music signals.

Previously, the fMRI signal analysis has been carried out either using empirical mean curve decomposition (EMCD) model or voxel selection on raw fMRI signal. The first methodology does signal decomposition that makes voxel selection process easy while the latter methodology does selection of relevant voxels (or features). Both these advantages are added by our methodology in which the frequency component is considered by decomposing the raw fMRI signal using Empirical mean and the voxels are selected from EMCD signal. The proposed methodologies are adopted for predicting the neural response.

Use of PSG is gold standard for detection of sleep apnea. This research is basically aimed at detection of sleep apnea from more commonly available physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals in any simple bedside multiparameter monitors. Respiratory activity extracted from ECG and PPG signals is used for the detection of apnea episodes. This process is useful in situations when recording of PSG is not possible or as a preliminary screening test of possible OSA in patients. In the present work ECG-derived respiration (EDR) and PPG derived respiration (PDR) signals, obtained using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, and are used to detect OSA episodes. Signals from MIMIC database were used for experimentation. The test results have revealed that the proposed method has efficiently extracted respiratory information from ECG and PPG signals for detection of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

Service composition has been acknowledged as a promising approach to meet the user demands, whenever a single service cannot fulfill the needs. It is essential to ensure the reliability of the composed service, as the component services are offered by multiple providers from different organizations. The behavioral or transactional properties of component services determine the reliability of the composite service. The guaranteed values on transactional properties of every service must be recorded in a contract as agreed by a consumer and a provider, in order to avoid unpredictable performance in service provisioning. The approach proposed in this paper enables generation of contracts at runtime along with transactional guarantees, based on the frequently changing business requirements of service consumers. The approach is experimented with a case study of Scan Report Generation in healthcare domain. © 2017 IEEE.",Dynamic Composition; Service Oriented Architecture; SLA; Web Services,Application programs; Information services; Interoperability; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Signal processing; Business requirement; Distributed software applications; Dynamic composition; Healthcare domains; Service compositions; Service orientation; Service provisioning; Transactional properties; Web services,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

However, the challenges in the implementation of floating point arithmetic on FPGA are that, the hardware modules are larger, have longer latency and high power consumption. In this work, a novel efficient reversible floating point fused arithmetic unit architecture is proposed confirming to IEEE 754 standard. By utilizing reversible logic circuits and implementation with adiabatic logic, power efficiency is achieved. The hardware complexity is reduced by employing fused elements and latency is improved by decomposing the operands in the realization of floating point multiplier and square root. To validate the design, the proposed unit was used for realization of FFT and FIR filter which are important applications of a DSP processor. As detection is one of the core baseband processing operations in digital communication receivers and the detection speed determines the data rates that can be achieved, the proposed unit has been used to implement the detection function. Simulation results and comparative studies with existing works demonstrate that the proposed unit efficiently utilizes the number of gates, has reduced quantum cost and produced less garbage outputs with low latency, thereby making the design a computational and power efficient one. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Reversible design for DSP; Reversible floating point arithmetic unit; Reversible MAC unit,Computer circuits; Digital arithmetic; Digital communication systems; Digital signal processing; FIR filters; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Program processors; Real time systems; Signal processing; Base-band processing; Comparative studies; Digital communications; High power consumption; Real-time signal processing; Reversible design for DSP; Reversible logic circuits; Reversible MAC unit; Computer architecture,"AnanthaLakshmi, A.V.email: anantha_av@pec.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,1419331,,MIMID,,English,Microprocessors Microsyst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009460332

A number of works have been reported over the years to accurately detect the vowel regions and the corresponding vowel onset points (VOPs) and vowel end points (VEPs). Effectiveness of the statistical acoustic modeling techniques and the front-end signal processing approaches has been explored in this regard. The work presented in this paper aims at improving the detection of vowel regions as well as the VOPs and VEPs. A number of statistical modeling approaches developed over the years have been employed in this work for the aforementioned task. To do the same, three-class classifiers (vowel, nonvowel and silence) are developed on the TIMIT database employing the different acoustic modeling techniques and the classification performances are studied. Using any particular three-class classifier, a given speech sample is then forced-aligned against the trained acoustic model under the constraints of first-pass transcription to detect the vowel regions. The correctly detected and spurious vowel regions are analyzed in detail to find the impact of semivowel and nasal sound units on the detection of vowel regions as well as on the determination of VOPs and VEPs. In addition to that, a novel front-end feature extraction technique exploiting the temporal and spectral characteristics of the excitation source information in the speech signal is also proposed. The use of the proposed excitation source feature results in the detection of vowel regions that are quite different from those obtained through the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Exploiting those differences in the obtained evidences by using the two kinds of features, a technique to combine the evidences is also proposed in order to get a better estimate of the VOPs and VEPs. When the proposed techniques are evaluated on the vowelnonvowel classification systems developed using the TIMIT database, significant improvements are noted. Moreover, the improvements are noted to hold across all the acoustic modeling paradigms explored in the presented work. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",DNN; Phone recognition system; SGMM; Vowel end point; Vowel onset point,Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Linguistics; Point contacts; Signal processing; Speech; Speech communication; Classification performance; End points; Excitation source information; Feature extraction techniques; Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient; Phone recognition; SGMM; Vowel onset point; Speech recognition,"Pradhan, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: gdp@nitp.ac.in",,Birkhauser Boston,0278081X,,CSSPE,,English,Circ Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016564269

The proposed model transforms a three-lead ECG into a standard twelve-lead ECG thereby enhancing its spatial resolution. The three leads used for prediction are obtained from the standard twelve-lead ECG. The proposed model takes advantage of the improved inter-lead correlation in wavelet domain. Since the model is patient-specific, it also selects the optimal predictor leads for a given patient using a lead selection algorithm. The lead selection algorithm is based on a new diagnostic similarity score which computes the diagnostic closeness between the original and the spatially enhanced leads. Standard closeness measures are used to assess the performance of the model. The similarity in diagnostic information between the original and the spatially enhanced leads are evaluated using various diagnostic measures. Repeatability and diagnosability are performed to quantify the applicability of the model. A comparison of the proposed model is performed with existing models that transform a subset of standard twelve-lead ECG into the standard twelve-lead ECG.

The proposed scheme solves the most frequently occurring watermarking security problems in Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based schemes which are unauthorized reading and false-positive detection. This scheme also optimizes fidelity and robustness characteristics. The grey image watermark splits into two parts using four bits MSBs and four bits LSBs of each pixel. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of these MSBs and LSBs values are embedded into the middle singular value of each block having size 4 × 4 of the host images one level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) sub-bands. The reason for incorporating Arnold Cat Map in the proposed scheme is to encode the watermark image before embedding it in the host image. The proposed scheme is a blind scheme and does not require the choice of scaling factor. Thus, the proposed scheme is secure as well as free from the false positive detection problem. The proposed watermarking scheme is tested for various malicious and non-malicious attacks.

This has led to the Dark Silicon problem, wherein only a fraction of transistors can operate at maximum frequency and nominal voltage, in order to ensure that the chip functions within the power and thermal budgets. Heterogeneous computing systems which consist of General Purpose Processors (GPPs), Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and application specific accelerators can provide improved performance while keeping power dissipation at a realistic level. For the accelerators to be effective, they have to be specialized for related classes of application kernels and have to be synthesized from high level specifications. Coarse Grained Reconfigurable has been proposed as accelerators for a variety of application kernels. For CGRAs to be used as accelerators in the Dark Silicon era, a synthesis framework which focuses on optimizing energy efficiency, while achieving the target performance is essential. However, existing compilation techniques for CGRAs focuses on optimizing only for performance, and any reduction in energy is just a side-effect. In this paper we explore synthesizing application kernels expressed as functions, on a coarse grained composable reconfigurable array (CGCRA). The proposed reconfigurable array comprises HyperCells, which are reconfigurable macro-cells that facilitate modeling power and performance in terms of easily measurable parameters. The proposed synthesis approach takes kernels expressed in a functional language, applies a sequence of well known program transformations, explores trade-offs between throughput and energy using the power and performance models, and realizes the kernels on the CGCRA.

The wavelet bases have been proved to be very efficient and flexible atoms. Towards the goal of obtaining optimal wavelet bases, we present a simple and efficient parametrization technique for constructing linear phase biorthogonal discrete-time wavelet bases that have joint timefrequency localization (JTFL) close to the lower bound of 0.25. In this paper, we first develop a parametrization technique to design biorthogonal filter banks (FBs). Then an optimization method is formulated to design jointly timefrequency localized discrete wavelet bases employing the designed FBs. Finally, the performance of the optimal wavelet bases is evaluated in image coding application. The proposed parametrization method presents a general and yet a very simple framework to construct a linear phase biorthogonal FB of desired order, with the prescribed number of vanishing moments (VMs) and free parameters. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the technique to design different classes of FB with various degrees of freedom.

The internal faults include the faults within the current transformer (CT) locations on two sides of the transformer. The noninternal fault includes magnetizing inrush current, sympathetic inrush current, recovery inrush current, external faults (faults outside the CT locations), and overfluxing. In conventional differential protection of a transformer, many maloperations of differential relay have been reported under certain working conditions. A new hybrid KNN-GA algorithm is put forward to improve the performance of the differential relay of a transformer. In this paper, real-time experimental results are presented for laboratory custom built differential relay model of a transformer. The generated experimental data for one power frequency cycle for various operating conditions is used by MATLAB to test the performance of a proposed algorithm.

Using a combination of signal processing, information and graph-theoretic techniques, this study has identified and characterized the changing connectivity patterns of the directed functional brain networks during different cognitive tasks.

Thus, the uterine contractions measured using uterine electromyogram (EMG) or electro hysterogram (EHG) need to have high sensitivity in the detection of true preterm labor signs. However, visual observation and manual interpretation of EHG signals at the time of emergency situation may lead to errors. Therefore, the employment of computer-based approaches can assist in fast and accurate detection during the emergency situation. This work proposes a novel algorithm using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) combined with wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), for automated prediction of pregnant women going to have premature delivery by using uterine EMG signals. The EMD is performed up to 11 levels on the normal and preterm EHG signals to obtain the different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These IMFs are further subjected to 6 levels of WPD and from the obtained coefficients, eight different features are extracted. From these extracted features, only the significant features are selected using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and selected features are ranked by Bhattacharyya technique. All the ranked features are fed to support vector machine (SVM) classifier for automated differentiation and achieved an accuracy of 96.25%, sensitivity of 95.08%, and specificity of 97.33% using only ten EHG signal features.

To accurately identify the QRS locations from the acquired raw ECG signals, we need to handle a number of challenges, which include noise, baseline wander, varying peak amplitudes, and signal abnormality. This research aims to address these challenges by developing an efficient lightweight algorithm for QRS (i.e., R-peak) detection from raw ECG signals. Methods A lightweight real-time sliding window-based Max-Min Difference (MMD) algorithm for QRS detection from Lead II ECG signals is proposed. Targeting to achieve the best trade-off between computational efficiency and detection accuracy, the proposed algorithm consists of five key steps for QRS detection, namely, baseline correction, MMD curve generation, dynamic threshold computation, R-peak detection, and error correction. Five annotated databases from Physionet are used for evaluating the proposed algorithm in R-peak detection. Integrated with a feature extraction technique and a neural network classifier, the proposed ORS detection algorithm has also been extended to undertake normal and abnormal heartbeat detection from ECG signals. Results The proposed algorithm exhibits a high degree of robustness in QRS detection and achieves an average sensitivity of 99.62% and an average positive predictivity of 99.67%. Its performance compares favorably with those from the existing state-of-the-art models reported in the literature. In regards to normal and abnormal heartbeat detection, the proposed QRS detection algorithm in combination with the feature extraction technique and neural network classifier achieves an overall accuracy rate of 93.44% based on an empirical evaluation using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia data set with 10-fold cross validation. Conclusions In comparison with other related studies, the proposed algorithm offers a lightweight adaptive alternative for R-peak detection with good computational efficiency. The empirical results indicate that it not only yields a high accuracy rate in QRS detection, but also exhibits efficient computational complexity at the order of O(n), where n is the length of an ECG signal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",ECG analysis; Feature extraction; Max-min difference algorithm; QRS or R-peak detection,"Biomedical signal processing; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Electrocardiography; Error correction; Extraction; Feature extraction; Signal detection; 10-fold cross-validation; Difference algorithms; ECG analysis; Empirical evaluations; Feature extraction techniques; Neural network classifier; QRS detection algorithms; R-peak detection; Computational efficiency; algorithm; Article; calculation; classifier; electrocardiography; false positive result; heart beat; mathematical analysis; QRS complex; artificial neural network; heart arrhythmia; heart rate; human; signal processing; Algorithms; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Zhang, L.; Computational Intelligence Research Group, Department of Computing Science and Digital Technologies, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria, Newcastle, United Kingdom",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28495007,English,Comput.

An SH system eliminates the need of a local oscillator (LO) and a carrier phase recovery (CPR) module at the receiver. Due to the inherent line-width tolerance of SH systems, an expensive laser is not required at the transmitter. In digital processing based receivers, analog-to-digital converters (ADC) are the dominant source of power and cost; signal processing in the analog domain can get rid of the usage of ADCs. Combination of these two approaches can lead to a huge power and cost saving. An SH-QPSK system with a polarization multiplexed carrier is experimentally demonstrated with a 28km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) channel and off-line signal processing at the receiver side. The system does not use any optical amplification and dispersion compensating fiber. A novel analog domain constant modulus algorithm-decision feedback equalizer (CMA-DFE) is proposed which is a cascade combination of two different types of equalizers. This proposed scheme gives improvement in the performance over an optimum CMA equalizer, because of the difference of minimum mean square errors (MMSE) of two different cost functions. © 2017 IEEE.",Coherent optical communication; decision feedback equalization; dual polarization-quadrature phase shift keying; self homodyne system,Analog to digital conversion; Cost functions; Costs; Decision feedback equalizers; Dispersion compensation; Equalizers; Optical communication; Polarization; Quadrature phase shift keying; Signal processing; Single mode fibers; Analog to digital converters; Coherent optical communications; Decision-feedback equalizations; Dispersion compensating fibers; Dual-polarizations; Minimum mean square errors (MMSE); Self-homodyne; Standard single mode fibers; Signal receivers,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Wirel.

Due to the massive amount of data generated by optical frontend, storing the raw data for offline post-processing is slow and impractical for the targeted single cell analysis applications. The proposed FPGA solution eliminates the need to transfer and persist the entire raw data by processing low-level signals and forming highlevel images in real-time. Objects of interest are detected and segmented from the image stream and a classifier subsequently performs high-level analysis on the segmented images. When compared with existing software-based post-processing workflow, this FPGA-based approach will improve both the number of objects captured per experiment and the overall end-to-end object classification performance.

Cell biasing modifies the user association criteria by incorporating Range Expansion Bias (REB) in traditional reference signal based user association technique. For sparse user distribution, REB for picocells does not offload users located outside RSRP Threshold Coverage Area. This is because the actual Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) value for such users is lesser than the threshold RSRP value for successful communication. On the other hand, using a negative REB value for dense user distribution around picocells is not desirable because it leads to higher interference at users and high energy consumption at macrocells. In this paper, we suggest a unified framework for coverage optimization using spectrum slicing and transmit power spreading. Our proposed framework considers a combination of subchannel transmit power and REB which is based on the user distribution around picocells. Additionally, in order to protect the signal quality of macrocell users located close to picocells, we suggest location aware subchannel allocation technique. This technique maximizes the number of Interference Free subchannels for macrocell users. Obtained results show that our proposed framework can significantly improve the coverage and system blocking for HetNet. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Coverage management; Macro-pico cellular network; Range expansion bias; Resource allocation; Spectrum slicing; Transmit power spreading,Cytology; Energy utilization; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Resource allocation; Signal processing; Wireless networks; Cellular network; Coverage management; Range expansion; Spectrum slicing; Transmit power; Cells,"Mishra, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: sudeepta@cse.iitm.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018784461

Also, FMCW-based SAR techniques are accepted for ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) instrumentation for early warning of fragile slopes such as in coal mines, avalanche detection. Features of images generated by FMCW SAR sensors need to be calibrated for interpretation purposes as like other forms of microwave imaging. In this paper, we demonstrate a ground-based method to calibrate high-resolution FMCW SAR image features by experimenting with a long railSAR testbed. Signal processing algorithms are derived to support high-resolution SAR image formation according to the requirement of the experiment. Trihedral corner reflectors (CRs) of submeter dimensions are placed on terrains with different normalized radar cross-section (RCS) coefficient (?0) to measure backscattering properties from targets and surrounding clutter from different heights and varied look angles. Calibration of the features of CRs is performed with respect to their physical dimensions by measuring the impulse response functions and spatial resolution in the SAR images. Target RCS and speckle properties derived from single-look and multilook processing of experimental data closely follows target and scene parameters such as radiometric and geometric measures of RCS of the CRs and ?0 of surroundings such as tar road and concrete road.

Infant cry is his only means of communication, production of which involves significant changes in its characteristics. Possibly rapid changes in its short-time segments carry information about the cause of cry, that a mother can perceive. The instantaneous fundamental frequency (Fo) of infant cries is much higher than for adults, necessitating different signal processing methods for infant cry signals' analyses. In this paper, the production characteristics of infant cry signals due to pain vs. discomfort are discriminated, exploring features that may help towards developing automated diagnostic systems. Production features the F0, strength of excitation (SoE) and signal energy (E) are used, for analysing 'Infant Cry Signals Database' collected for the study. The excitation source characteristics are derived using a modified zero-frequency filtering method. Spectrograms of the acoustic signal and the excitation source characteristics are compared to validate the changes in the features.

Signal compression is the technique, used to reduce the amount of data that must be transmitted in the signal communication. Algorithms that produce better compression ratio and less loss of data in the reconstructed signal are needed for signal compression. This paper presents the wavelet based signal compression algorithm for ECG signal MIT-BIH arrhythmia database record 117, LELECCUM signal and TIMIT audio signal using adaptive coder. The architecture for mean removal, haar wavelet transform, adaptive encoder, inverse haar wavelet transform and mean insertion are present in this paper. The mean removal is used, since the mean removed signal requires less number of binary bits for their representation. The haar wavelet transform is used to decompose the signal. The proposed adaptive encoder is used to minimize the number of bits transmitted. Experimental results prove that the proposed coder outperforms than other coders such as novel algorithm, Djohn, EZW, SPIHT in terms of simplicity and coding efficiency. For the proposed coder, a compression ratio of 9.344:1 is obtained for MIT-BIH arrhythmia database record 117 with a percent mean square difference as 1.2735. A smooth signal like LELECCUM, a compression ratio of 14.267:1 is achieved with a percent mean square difference as 1.3673.

The problem becomes quite complex in case of mixed signal processing. Traditional techniques for noise and interference reduction may not produce desirable solutions in such situations. Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FM-CW) Radar Altimeter required for altitude measurement during landing aerial vehicles is realized as a mixed signal processor. The receiver design is based on digital signal processing of the down converted and digitized signal in the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The highest peak component in the FFT output represents the measured altitude. The level of noise suppression required is very high to achieve better receiver sensitivity which in turn can provide higher altitude measurement.

Extracting Features of EEG signal in real time is the most challenging task because of its high variability and complexity. In this paper we have used FPGA (Virtex-5) for extracting the features in real time for Brain Computer Interface applications. Nowadays, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) plays a major crucial role in helping the persons those who are partly or wholly incapable of movement. BCI system which depends on neural signals generated by the brain and these neural signals are recorded using Non Invasive or Invasive techniques. In non invasive technique like EEG (electroencephalography) recordings are taken from the scalp and it is used for analyzing the brain's activity. When compared to Invasive one, non-invasive techniques give a lesser accuracy and less harm to humans. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system, appropriate classification and feature extraction methods are chosen. Existing BCI feature extraction techniques, extracts many features such as band energies,power spectral density etc., but achieving a good classification accuracy is a great challenge. In our paper, this problem is addressed by extracting only P300 event and a good classification accuracy is obtained. EEG signals are stored in internal Block RAM to reduce the design time and complexity. This Block RAM is easy to design and improves the processing speed. The features are extracted from EEG signal using Hanning filter and FIR filter. The performance of FIR and Hanning filter is compared in terms of classification accuracy, using Fisher Linear Discriminator. The area, power and delay are compared by implementing the proposed approach in Virtex-5. However, FIR filter occupies more area, it has very high classification accuracy. Since accuracy plays a major role in BCI applications such as P300 speller,Wheel chair control through EEG, Drivewaves, NeuroBrush, FIR is chosen as Feature extraction technique. © 2016 IEEE.",Accuracy; Efficiency; FIR filter; FPG; Hanning filter,Brain; Brain computer interface; Efficiency; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); FIR filters; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuits; Interfaces (computer); Power spectral density; Signal processing; Spectral density; Accuracy; Brain-computer interface applications; Classification accuracy; Feature extraction methods; Feature extraction techniques; Fisher linear discriminator; Hanning filter; Noninvasive technique; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Henceforth, in this paper a novel algorithm for automatic segmentation of the heart sound signal is proposed. The heart sound signal is acquired using seismocardiography (SCG), which uses a sensor called accelerometer. The accelerometer is of small size and low weight and thus convenient to wear. The proposed algorithm performs in three steps. First, the signal is filtered using the developed denoising algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform. The computational complexity of this algorithm is reduced by processing only two levels, which are expected to have heart sound signal, and other levels are discarded. To improve the performance of denoising, an adaptive threshold is obtained for both the levels separately, and applied. Then, the denoised signal is obtained by reconstructing the thresholded coefficients. In the second step, peaks are detected in the denoised signal using an adaptive threshold, obtained using Otsu's method. Then, false detected peaks and noise contaminated parts of the signal are identified and discarded from further analyses. In the third step, the heart sound components are identified as S1, and S2 based on the energy of the particular component and segmentation is performed. The results of denoising, show that the developed algorithm outperforms the existing method. Further, the segmentation results show that the developed algorithm is able to identify the heart sound components, accurately, even in the presence of noise. © 2016 IEEE.",heart sound signal; heart valve disease; Phonocardiography; Seismocardiography; wavelet denoising,Accelerometers; Acoustic noise; Cardiology; Computational complexity; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Heart; Phonocardiography; Signal denoising; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Automatic segmentations; De-noising algorithm; Heart sound signal; Heart valve disease; Segmentation of heart sounds; Segmentation results; Seismocardiography; Wavelet denoising; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

Several Biometric security systems and authentication proceduresare already in use ranging from fingerprint scanners to facial recognition software. Even with the rapid advancement of these security systems, they are still susceptible to frauds. The proposed ECG based authentication (ECGA) could prove to be highly secure and cost effective, if employed correctly. This is a non-invasive technique. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained is unique to different individuals i.e., no two persons have same cardiac rhythm. ECGA aims to exploit this fact to provide unique security identity to all the individuals which is used for authentication process. A new authentication strategy is being employed here, where Time domain ECG signal processing is performed involving filtering, peak detection, ECG waveform segmentation, autocorrelation and amplitude normalization. Further the processed signal is fed to the Neural Networks, powers of Neural Networks are harnessed to create a supervised system that can identify individuals by matching the real time sample to the template present in the template database.

In this work we present a semi automatic scheme to discriminate patient-specific ECG beats by using a kernel based feature extraction technique called kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA). The heartbeat classification scheme uses a fixed global training set along with a local patient specific training set to produce a patient adapted training set. The performance of the KCCA features is verified on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database by using three classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and vector valued regularized kernel function approximation (VVRKFA), to classify four different type of beats, normal (N), supra-ventricular (S), ventricular (V) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F).

In this context, a dynamic hash key based integrated RC4 stream cipher with the hash function using nonlinear feedback shift register (NFSR) is proposed in this paper. Unlike the existing stream ciphers, the novelty of this proposed hash-based stream cipher algorithm is to generate a dynamic key using NFSR. The proposed algorithm is coded using Verilog HDL to produce dynamic binary key stream and implemented on commercially available FPGA device Virtex 5 xc5vlx110t-2ff1136.

Now it is time to shift at least partially our focus to FD networking, such as in cellular networks. FD networking has more complicated interference environments. Therefore, its performance improvement is not that straightforward compared with half-duplex networking. Before putting FD networking into practice, we need to understand to which scenarios FD communications should be applied under the current technology maturity, how bad the performance will be if we do nothing to deal with the newly introduced interference, and most importantly, how much improvement could be achieved after applying advanced interference management solutions. We will discuss all these questions in this article.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of five different linear and nonlinear unsupervised dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques namely principal component analysis (PCA), fast independent component analysis (fastICA) with tangential, kurtosis and Gaussian contrast functions, kernel PCA (KPCA) with polynomial kernel, hierarchical nonlinear PCA (hNLPCA) and principal polynomial analysis (PPA) on classification of cardiac arrhythmias using probabilistic neural network classifier (PNN). The design phase of the classification model comprises of the following stages: preprocessing of the cardiac signal by eliminating detail coefficients that contain noise, feature extraction through Daubechies wavelet transform, dimensionality reduction through unsupervised DR techniques, and arrhythmia classification using PNN. PCA is a widely used DR technique for mapping high dimensional data to its low dimensional representation. But real world data like electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are complex and nonlinear in nature. This work concentrates on performance analysis of four nonlinear DR techniques and conventional linear PCA technique on classification of cardiac arrhythmias. Entire MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used for experimentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the combination of PNN classifier (at spread parameter, ? = 0.4) and fastICA DR technique with tangential contrast function exhibit highest F score of 99.83% with a minimum of 10 dimensions. hNLPCA and KPCA requires more computation time for low dimensional mapping.

In the traditional hardware design, the 8-point DCT architecture contains more number of logical slices in it. Also, it consists of number of multipliers to update the weight. This leads to huge area consumption and power dissipation in that architecture. To mitigate the conventional drawbacks, this paper presents a novel Hierarchical-based Expression (HBE)-Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM)-based multiplier architecture design for the 8-point DCT structure used in the video CODEC applications. The proposed work involves modified data path architecture and Floating Point Processing Element (FPPE) architecture. Our proposed design of the multipliers and DCT architecture requires minimum number of components when compared to the traditional DCT method. The HBE-MCM-based multiplier architecture includes shifters and adders. The number of Flip-Flops (FFs) and Look Up Tables (LUTs) used in the proposed architecture is reduced. The power consumption is reduced due to the reduction in the size of the components. This design is synthesized in VERILOG code language and implemented in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

Epilepsy is one of the brain's disorder. Automated diagnosis of epilepsy can be done by measuring and analyzing the nonlinear and non-stationary trends in EEG signals. This paper introduces a new diagnostic approach for analysis and classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. In time-scale domain, the tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) can reliably represent the sparsity in oscillatory signals. The proposed methodology begins with application of TQWT to efficiently characterize the non-stationary behavior and sparsity of EEG signals. TQWT decomposes the considered signals into a valuable set of band-limited signals termed as sub-bands for better feature extraction. Kraskov entropy is a nonlinear parameter to detect the presence of nonlinear trends in the signals. After decomposition, Kraskov entropy is computed from the specific sub-band as a decisive feature in order to discriminate seizure-free from the epileptic seizure EEG signals. Subsequently, obtained feature vectors are used for classifying the seizure and seizure-free EEG signals using the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. While doing analysis, it has been observed that value of proposed Kraskov entropy based feature is significantly higher for seizure EEG signals as compared to that of seizure-free EEG signals. Furthermore, the experimental results of this work has demonstrated significant values of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient. It is noteworthy that proposed framework uses single feature to diagnose the epilepsy accurately. Also the application of the proposed work on EEG data from the University of Bonn, Germany highlights the consistency and in some cases superiority of the proposed method over other popular methods. © 2017",Classification; Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal; Epilepsy; Kraskov entropy; Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM); Tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT),Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Entropy; Feature extraction; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurology; Neurophysiology; Nonlinear analysis; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Correlation coefficient; Electroencephalogram signals; Epilepsy; Least square support vector machines; Non-linear parameters; Non-stationary behaviors; Tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT); Signal detection; Article; correlation coefficient; decomposition; diagnostic procedure; electroencephalogram; entropy; human; Kraskov entropy; oscillation; parameters; priority journal; seizure; signal processing; support vector machine; tunable Q wavelet transform; wavelet analysis,"Patidar, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Goa, Farmagudi, India; email: shivnarayn.patidar@nitgoa.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

The newly proposed fibers named from Type 1 to Type 5 have a flattened dispersion over S, C, L and U bands. Predominantly, few-mode HNL-UFF fiber of Type 3 yields dispersion-flattened characteristics over a range of 250 nm of optical communication spectrum with a mere 0.2 ps/nm km variation in dispersion and a dispersion slope of 0.0057ps/nm2 km due to the contribution of higher-order modes to the dispersion characteristics of the fiber. Moreover, it has a moderate nonlinear coefficient of 8.03W-1km-1. By modifying the refractive index profile of Type 3 fiber, Type 4 and Type 5 fibers are obtained in order to ensure single-mode operation, while the zero flattened dispersion characteristics of the fiber are compromised. Among the newly proposed fibers, Type 4 fiber offers a very low ITU-T cutoff wavelength of 1.33?m, whereas in the case of Type 5 fiber it is 1.38?m. Moreover, Type 4 and Type 5 fibers have good nonlinear coefficients of 12.26W-1km-1 and 11.45W-1km-1, respectively. By virtue of the proposed optimized index profile, an insensitive behavior toward bending is displayed by Type 3, Type 4 and Type 5 fibers.

Detection of edges for an image may help for image segmentation, data compression, and image reconstruction. Edges of an image are considered a type of crucial information that can be extracted by applying detectors with different methodologies. Its main purpose is to simplify the image data in order to minimize the amount of data to be processed. There exist many rich classical edge detection techniques which make use of integer-order differentiation operators and can function in both spatial and frequency domains. In the case of integer-order differentiation operators, the gradient operator is identified by order one and the Laplacian by order two. This paper demonstrates a new kind of edge detector based on the fractional (non-integer)-order differentiation operation and through the usage of the fractional Fourier transformation tool, so as to perform it in the fractional Fourier frequency domain, known as the edge detection based on fractional signal processing approach. It is shown through computer simulations that this approach can detect the edges precisely and efficiently. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated from the quantitative aspects of mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio through simulations. The experiments show that, for any grayscale image, this method can obtain better edge detection performance to satisfy human visual sense. Moreover, comparisons are also provided to prove that the proposed method outperforms the classical edge detection operators, interpreted in terms of robustness to noise. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Edge detection; Fractional differential mask; Fractional Fourier frequency domain filtering; Fractional Fourier transform; Fractional-order calculus; GrünwaldLetnikov fractional derivative,Calculations; Differentiation (calculus); Edge detection; Fourier optics; Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Image compression; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Mean square error; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Fractional derivatives; Fractional differential; Fractional Fourier transforms; Fractional-order calculus; Frequency-domain filtering; Signal detection,"Kumar, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: sanjay.kumar@thapar.edu",,Birkhauser Boston,0278081X,,CSSPE,,English,Circ Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013997820

The cover image is encrypted; the information to be secured is scrambled, and then embedded in the Intermediate Significant Bit (ISB) planes of encrypted cover image, at the locations determined by a Pseudorandom Address Vector (PAV). The pseudorandom embedding of the scrambled data in the ISB planes of encrypted image results in a three tier security of the data to be secured. The ISBPE embedding results in an important advantage that the proposed scheme becomes completely robust to commonly employed attack of Least Significant Bit (LSB) removal/replacement. A novel concept of embedding a very small size fragile watermark in addition to the secret information has been used which facilitates early tamper detection. This feature could save crucial processor time in critical situations of national security issues/warfare etc. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more robust to various signal processing attacks like Joint Picture Expert Group compression, Additive White Gaussian Noise and salt and pepper noise as compared to conventional LSB based embedding techniques.

Unlike existing algorithms, the watermark payload in this approach is made adaptive based on the nature of the audio signal. This localized feature based approach to determine the payload addresses the issue of over-loading and under-loading the audio signals with watermark data making the payload optimized for each individual audio host signal. Some audio features are strategically extracted and the most discriminatory features are selected using Principal Component analysis (PCA) approach. A mathematical model is designed using selected audio features like energy, zero cross mean and short time energy to evaluate the degree of embedding under perceptual transparency. It is used to estimate the number of watermarking bits to be inserted for a particular audio signal which makes the approach adaptive in nature optimizing the watermarking payload. At the embedding stage, watermark is embedded in the host audio signal in the third level detailed coefficient of wavelet domain which strikes a balance between the contradicting design parameters of perceptual transparency, robustness and optimized payload. Watermark extraction in this paper is blind with good robustness to signal processing attacks. Experimental results validate that the proposed adaptive algorithm provide good imperceptibility with good robustness against signal processing attacks at adjustable payload for different types of audio signals.

The entire scheme is implemented in a 3U size chassis. 28 numbers of channels of AD215 isolation amplifiers are integrated in 7-modules with 4-channels/module. Each module is designed to operate in different modes like attenuation, amplification, calibration, dc error check, self-test and standby. These modes of operation can be selected using a LabVIEW based GUI from a remote PC. A TMS320F38335 based controller module is designed for this purpose and is being integrated in the chassis.

The skew between two remote nodes is first detected and amplified using subsampling. Since the information signal is a slow varying clock skew, subsampling the input clock signals actually over samples the input information for this case. This concept is utilized by following the subsampling stage with a sigma-delta TDC. While block averaging technique can be used for evaluating DC clock skew, a moving average scheme in the form of a sigma-delta TDC is a better approach for measurement of skew with low frequency jitter. In this paper, we describe an all-digital implementation of a system for measurement of skew with low frequency jitter using an up-down counter which operates like the integrator in a conventional ADC. A detailed noise shaping and transfer function analysis is presented which shows the negligible effect of quantization noise introduced by the digital integrator at the output of TDC. The TDC has been designed for 9 bits effective resolution using a 6 bit digital integrator for slow varying clock skew. © 2016 IEEE.",Asynchronous subsampling; Clock skew measurement; Sigma-Delta modulation; Time to digital converter,Clocks; Delta modulation; Delta sigma modulation; Electric clocks; Embedded systems; Jitter; Signal processing; VLSI circuits; Asynchronous subsampling; Averaging technique; Clock skew measurements; Digital Integrator; Effective resolutions; Information signals; Time to digital converters; Transfer function analysis; Frequency converters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.- Int.

Finally the weak reflected signal from target reach to the receiving antenna after passing through wall again. To improve the signal strength of the target and hence detection, clutter reduction technique is proposed.

Reference to the existing literature, embedding watermark in the singular values of SVD gives a robust algorithm and embedding in wavelet coefficients provide good transparency. The embedding quantization function is designed in such a way that it introduces minimal changes in the signal while embedding and provide opportunity to hide more watermarking data. The features of both the domains have been properly utilized to achieve robustness and imperceptibility at an acceptable level. The experimental results validate that proposed hybrid technique is robust to various signal processing attacks with good perceptual transparency at high payload.

The EEMD decomposes vibration signals into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A systematic methodology to select IMFs that are sensitive and closely related to the fault is proposed in the paper. The change in probability distribution of the energies of the sensitive IMFs is measured through JRD which acts as a damage identification parameter. Evaluation of JRD with sensitive IMFs makes it largely unaffected by change/fluctuations in operating conditions. Further, an algorithm based on Chebyshev's inequality is applied to JRD to identify exact points of change in bearing health and remove outliers. The identified change points are investigated for fault classification as possible locations where specific defect initiation could have taken place. For fault classification, two new parameters are proposed: ? value and Probable Fault Index, which together classify the fault. To standardize the degradation process, a Confidence Value parameter is proposed to quantify the bearing degradation value in a range of zero to unity. A simulation study is first carried out to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed JRD parameter under variable operating conditions of load and speed. The proposed methodology is then validated on experimental data (seeded defect data and accelerated bearing life test data). The first validation on two different vibration datasets (inner/outer) obtained from seeded defect experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JRD parameter in detecting a change in health state as the severity of fault changes.

We have proposed a Taylor Series expansion of the psychoacoustic corruption function, which provides for superior noise robustness. The proposed joint adaptation algorithm consists of Psychoacoustic Model Compensation (Psy-Comp) and Model-domain Cepstral Mean Normalization (MCMN). While the Psy-Comp compensates for the additive noise component, the MCMN compensates for the channel component. The proposed algorithms are validated through experiments on noise corrupted TIMIT speech recognition database. We show that the joint compensation scheme provides 5% (absolute) performance gain compared to the Vector Taylor Series (VTS) scheme. Also, the proposed technique is computationally efficient and faster as compared to the VTS scheme. © 2016 IEEE.",Additive Noise; Model Compensation; Model Domain Mean Normalization; Speech Recognition; Vector Taylor Series,Acoustics; Additive noise; Crime; Deep neural networks; Signal processing; Taylor series; Cepstral mean normalization; Computationally efficient; Model compensation; Model domains; Noise robust speech recognition; Psychoacoustic model; Taylor series expansions; Vector taylor series; Speech recognition,,Qiuqi R.Baozong Y.Yao Z.Gaoyun A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,Int Conf Signal Process Proc,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016316146

To find pitch a peak detection algorithm is developed which find the dominant frequencies of vowel part of speech signal and then select the fundamental frequency from them. The evaluation is done on the 200 voice samples by using POC as the accuracy parameter. Gender identification is an important step in speaker and speech recognition system. A gender dependent system reduces the size and complexity of the system. Detecting the gender from the non linguistic characteristics of the voice is well known as gender detection. To extract the gender information from the speech signal we have used a feature called pitch from voiced part of the speech signal. To extract the mentioned feature 'pitch' from the speech signal we develop a peak detection algorithm and used standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique.

A gunshot localizer in this scenario can alert the troops of the incoming bullet. Firing of a gun produces a high sound pressure which can be used for locating the shooting position. Such devices also find application in high security areas to listen for any probable attacks. For detecting and localizing a gunshot, an array of microphones connected to a Data Acquisition and Processing Unit is employed. The microphones listen to acoustical events and the associated system continuously looks for any signal of interest. Following the signal detection Time Difference of Arrival of the sound at the different microphones are processed to extract the positional information of a gunshot. The positional information comprises of Azimuth, Elevation and Range of the source of gunfire relative to the sensor array.

In addition to the huge surge in streaming video demand in recent years, a growing trend of high audience churn-out to competitors, increases the necessity to assure high video quality at any cost for a largely global consumer base. Hence, there is an urgent need to devise an optimum performance analysis solutions for digital streaming video signals considering all major factors related to end user perception as well as growing concurrent load on the content servers. It is often noticed, that performance analysis of specialized programs like video is done using simulation based methodologies or highly scaled down real user testing techniques, which don't truly represent the real world scenarios. Moreover many dynamic factors like user traffic, concurrency, network bandwidths, packet delay, device types etc. have a significant impact on video performance. Due to these factors the complexity of the test environment and test conditions increases significantly.

This instrumentation amplifier (IA) is designed for low power while maintaining the high gain' high CMRR' low noise as well as other design constraints. The Instrumentation amplifier contains two identical two stage op-Amps at the input (gain) stage and one difference amplifier at output stage. By using operational amplifier at the gain stage in saturation region and difference amplifier at the output stage in subthreshold region to achieve high gain and CMMRR. Aspect ratio (W/L) plays very important role in achieving these designing constraints. In this paper our main focus is to achieve high gain and high CMRR with moderate noise and less power performance for modern circuit's applications. The whole instrumentation amplifier schematic is designed and simulated at 180nm CMOS technology using Cadence Spectre tool. The IA achieve an overall gain and CMRR of 79.16 dB and 98 dB respectively.

An accelerator module can be attached to digital signal processors for enhancing the performance. It enhances the performance or functionality by executing certain function in the accelerator instead of executing in the processor core. Adding accelerators is suitable in cases where the flexibility is essential and in most of the DSP applications. The accelerator module mainly consists of flexible computational units (FCUs). The structure of the computational unit is designed to enable high performance flexible operation based on a set of operation templates found in DSP kernels. One of the main advantages of this multiplier is that the recoding scheme used in it reduces the number of partial products which in turn reduces the area and the delay. A high performance architectural scheme is designed by combining both the architectural and arithmetic levels of optimization. As a result of architecture level of optimization area can be reduced. Conventional adders are replaced with fast adders to reduce the propagation delay. The proposed solution forms an efficient design tradeoff point delivering optimized latency/area. It also provides high computing performance, real time processing to variety of applications ranging from sensors to servers. © 2016 IEEE.",Digital signal processing (DSP); DSP Accelerator; Flexible Computational Unit (FCU); Modified Booth (MB) Multipliers,Acceleration; Adders; Digital signal processors; Signal processing; Accelerator architectures; Computational units; Computing performance; Digital signal processing (DSP); Embedded implementation; Hardware acceleration; Implementation strategies; Multimedia applications; Digital signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Many of the applications in audio signal processing such as automatic speech recognition, telecommunications and hearing aid applications etc. requires an effective way of segregating the target speech from the mixed speech. Pitch information has an important role in the field of audio signal processing, especially in speech segregation. In this paper a computationally efficient model for pitch estimation using cepstrum based method is proposed. This model divides the input signal in to two channels, and then computes the cepstrum coefficients of each channel. The summation of cepstrum coefficients of both channels is used for the pitch frequency extraction of target and interference speaker. Based on the pitch frequency a time frequency mask is generated to eliminate the interference pitch frequencies.

Radio transmission and data processing are energy consuming processes. No compensation can be done in the field of energy consumption in radio transmission. This paper concentrates on energy reduction in the field of On the node processing. Due to limited energy supply from batteries the node must trade communication for on the node computation. Many of the WSN data processing algorithms use parallel prefix operations as common denominator. Parallel Prefix Operations have the form of Binary Tree Architecture. Binary tree architecture uses more number of Processing Element (PE) s. Parallel Prefix operations using Binary Tree Architecture (BTA) uses more area and more power. Binary Tree Architecture can be modified in to area and power efficient Folded Tree Architecture (FTA).

Employing Non-invasive procedures for measurement of fECG not only ensures minimal patient discomfort, but also makes the product suitable for wearable applications. However, non-invasive fECG extraction has proven to be difficult due to low amplitudes of fECG signals, attenuation by maternal biological tissues, overlapping spectra with other fetal and maternal bio-signals and low-frequency noise in measurement devices. This paper describes the design of a noise optimized Analog-Front-End (AFE) for a non-invasive fECG monitor. The design criterion laid down for the fECG monitor require it to be an ambulatory, low-power, inexpensive device, interfaced to a smart-phone and capable of running computationally intensive signal processing algorithms. The primary role of the AFE is to filter-out large DC offsets, movement artifacts, high-frequency noise and subsequently amplify and condition the extracted signals before digitization. This noise optimized design makes use of active-electrodes fabricated on small printed circuit boards (PCB). Each PCB is mounted on standard Ag-AgCl electrodes to buffer, filter and amplify abdominal bio-signals as soon as they are detected. The extracted signals are then sent to the fECG monitor PCB for further processing and signal conditioning, before being digitized by a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of an ARM Cortex M3 based system-on-chip (SoC). The monitor is designed to work with supply voltages from 3.6Vdc to 5.5Vdc, allowing it to be powered from a variety of sources; battery packs to USB connectors. Working of the AFE was tested using synthetic signals and elementary biological signals. © 2016 IEEE.",,Analog to digital conversion; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Electrodes; Integrated circuit design; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit design; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; Smartphones; System-on-chip; Analog to digital converters; Assessment technique; Fetal electrocardiographies; High-frequency noise; Printed circuit boards (PCB); Signal processing algorithms; System on chips (SoC); Wearable applications; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Stud.

But, HVS is particularly insensitive to subtle motions with low amplitude. Though, in many practical fields, e.g., biomedical science, earth science, plasma science etc., these low amplitude motions are significant for predicting certain crucial events, most of the signal processing methods fail to analyze them as they are difficult to detect in natural scenes. Thus, a specialized manual intervention is generally required to analyze these data. The situation worsens in presence of noise, inherent to any imaging system, as it is difficult to distinguish imperceptible motions in noisy environment. In this paper we propose a robust method to detect and classify imperceptible motion in a video sequence. The proposed algorithm exploits a total variation (TV) based video decomposition to detect the motion in a scene and detected motion is classified by training a support vector machines (SVM) after the detection.

Sadness and anger emotions are considered in this study. For emotion conversion, we propose signal processing methods to process neutral speech in three ways: (i) modifying the energy spectra (ii) modifying the source features and (iii) modifying the prosodic features. Energy spectra of different emotions are analyzed, and a method has been proposed to modify the energy spectra of neutral speech after dividing the speech into different frequency bands. For the source part, epoch strength and epoch sharpness are extensively studied. A new method has been proposed for modification and incorporation of epoch strength and epoch sharpness parameters using appropriate modification factors. Prosodic features like pitch contour and intensity have also been modified in this work. New pitch contours corresponding to the target emotions are derived from the pitch contours of neutral test utterances. The new pitch contours are incorporated into the neutral utterances. Intensity modification is done by dividing neutral utterances into three equal segments and modifying the intensities of these segments separately, according to the modification factors suitable for the target emotions. Subjective evaluation using mean opinion scores has been carried out to evaluate the quality of converted emotional speech. Though the modified speech does not completely resemble the target emotion, the potential of these methods to change the style of the speech is demonstrated by these subjective tests. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Emotion conversion; Energy spectrum; Epoch sharpness; Epoch strength; Intensity; Pitch contour,Frequency bands; Processing; Quality control; Spectroscopy; Speech; Emotion conversion; Energy spectra; Epoch sharpness; Epoch strength; Intensity; Pitch contours; Signal processing,"Haque, A.; Department of Computer Science, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: rjlhq05@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13812416,,ISTEF,,English,Int J Speech Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992755839

Being contradictory in nature these two requirements pose design challenges. This paper presents an innovative application of a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (HTS) function to vary the time-varying pole-radius (TVPR) of the pole-zero-constrained (PZC) IIR notch filter to optimally attain these two requirements together. Application of HTS function has allowed the pole-radius to maintain its desired minimum value during the initial phase of filtering, leading to faster transient suppression. This is followed by a steep rise in the pole-radius which allowed the notch filter to attain its desired quality factor soon after the transient suppression was achieved. Therefore, prime emphasis of the proposed notch filter design approach is on the significant reduction of the duration during which pole-radius makes a transition from its minimum to maximum designed values. The performance of proposed notch filter was assessed for transient suppression and selectivity responses in addition to removal of the power line interference from an ECG signal in the LabVIEW based simulation and hardware implementation environment. Based on significant improved performances over recent reported exponential TVPR PZC IIR notch filter in all the presented investigations, it is concluded that the proposed design is a better candidate for enhancing the post-transient performance of IIR PZC notch filter. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Digital IIR notch filter; ECG signals; Pole-radius-varying filter; Post-transient filter performance enhancement; Transient suppression,Bandpass filters; Electrocardiography; Hardware; Hyperbolic functions; IIR filters; Poles; Signal processing; ECG signals; Filter performance; IIR notch filters; Pole radius; Transient suppression; Notch filters; Article; computer; computer simulation; controlled study; digital IIR notch filter; electrocardiography; filter; filter design; frequency modulation; hyperbolic tangent sigmoid; image quality; performance; priority journal; radiological parameters; sigmoid; signal noise ratio; signal processing; simulator; time; time varying pole radius,"Rana, K.P.S.; Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Sector-3, Dwarka, India; email: kpsrana1@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

These features support better attachment of it to the subject's body and hence get less affected by the slow motion of the subject. However, noise generated due to the footsteps, while walking, contaminates the SCG signal. Therefore, in this paper, a novel method is proposed to remove these contaminations from the SCG signal. A three-Axis accelerometer was attached to the chest wall such that heart sound components are reflected in the z-Axis while the motion noise due to footstep will be seen in the x-Axis. To remove the noise components from the heart signal (z-Axis), the location of footsteps from the x-Axis are identified and the corresponding components from the z-Axis are removed. After noise removal fundamental heart sounds (FHS), S1 and S2, are identified using Otsu's threshold method. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-The-Art methods.

We propose a two stage separation process where the initial stage is based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert transform generally known as HilbertHuang transform. EMD decomposes the mixed signal into oscillatory functions known as intrinsic mode functions. Hilbert transform is applied to find the instantaneous amplitudes and Fuzzy C-Means clustering is applied to group the speakers at initial stage. In second stage of separation speaker groups are transformed into timefrequency domain using short time Fourier transform (STFT). Timefrequency ratios are computed by dividing the STFT matrix of mixed speech signal and STFT matrix of stage1 recovered speech signals. Histogram of the ratios obtained can be used to estimate the ideal binary mask for each speaker. These masks are applied to the speech mixture and the underlying speakers are estimated.

In this paper we propose a system for single channel speech separation by combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multi pitch information. The proposed method is completely unsupervised and requires no knowledge of the underlying speakers. In this method we apply EMD to short frames of the mixed speech for better estimation of the speech specific information. Speech specific information is derived through multi pitch tracking. To track multi pitch information from the mixed signal we apply simple-inverse filtering tracking and histogram based pitch estimation to excitation source information along with estimating the number of speakers present in the mixed signal. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",BSS; EMD; Excitation source; IMF; LP analysis; Multi pitch information; SCSS; SIFT,Audition; Blind source separation; Continuous speech recognition; Hearing aids; Information filtering; Separation; Signal processing; Speech; Speech analysis; Excitation sources; LP analysis; Multi pitches; SCSS; SIFT; Speech recognition,"Prasanna Kumar, M.K.; BMS College of EngineeringIndia; email: prasannamk.tce@bmsce.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,13812416,,ISTEF,,English,Int J Speech Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000788229

For the PCG signal, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based denoising method has been used extensively due to its good performance. However, the performance of this method depends on the threshold value and the way to apply it on the wavelet coefficients. Therefore, in this paper, an adaptive method is proposed to estimate the threshold value for the shrinking of the wavelet coefficients of the PCG signal. For this purpose, a new statistical parameter is obtained by incorporating medical domain knowledge about the PCG. The threshold value is estimated based on the statistical analysis of the wavelet coefficients and the present level of noise. Further, to overcome the issues related to existing threshold functions, soft and hard, new threshold functions, mid and non-linear mid are presented. The proposed method is applied to the PCG signal contaminated with simulated white Gaussian noise, red noise, and pink noise. The obtained results of the proposed method are compared with the results of state-of-The-Art methods and they show the superiority of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.",Denoising; DWT; function; Heart sound signal; Phonocardiogram; Threshold,Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Discrete wavelet transforms; Functions; Gaussian noise (electronic); Phonocardiography; Shrinkage; Signal denoising; Signal processing; De-noising; Diagnostic efficiency; Heart sound signal; Phonocardiograms; State-of-the-art methods; Statistical parameters; Threshold; White Gaussian Noise; Wavelet transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,Int Conf Dig Signal Process DSP,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016193311

Further, the empirical mode decomposition method is implemented to extract various intrinsic mode functions from the non-stationary signal disturbance waveforms that are already superimposed by various undulating modes. A novel short-time modified Hilbert transform with an equivalent window is applied on all the intrinsic mode functions to extract the modified Hilbert energy spectrum and instantaneous magnitude response. Distinct features are derived from the short-time modified Hilbert energy spectrum for automatic classification of non-stationary power signals. The features obtained from the short-time modified Hilbert transform are found to be different, understandable, and immune to noise. These features are then applied to the modified fuzzy C-means based improved bacterial foraging optimization algorithm for improving the classification accuracy of the disturbances. Extensive simulation results yield excellent visual detection, localization, and classification of the different types of non-stationary power signal disturbances.

In this manuscript, linear phase multiband stop filters (LPMBSFs) are designed using a robust hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called improved cuckoo search particle swarm optimization (ICSPSO) for searching desired impulse responses of the filters. Generally LPMBSFs are considered for simultaneous processing of group of spectra widely used in digital communication and signal processing applications. The window method and the simple frequency sampling method of designing linear phase multiband filters (LPMBFs) have no precise control over the stop band and pass band cut-off frequencies. Thus in order to improve the design strategy of the LPMBSF, optimum design criterion is devised where the error between ideal frequency response and practical frequency response is reduced by incorporating the efficient modern swarm and global evolutionary computation technique. The ICSPSO technique is such an excellent hybrid global random search technique for error minimization, and is structured incorporating the advantages of cuckoo search algorithm into particle swarm optimization (PSO) while the global searching capability is further accelerated by tuning the mutation operation of differential evolution (DE) technique. The quality of the proposed ICSPSO based filter design has been compared with other prominent optimal method of design such as hybrid cuckoo search particle swarm optimization (CSPSO), improved cuckoo search (ICS) optimization, and PSO. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Error fitness; ICSPSO algorithm; Improved cuckoo-search algorithm; Multiband stop filter; Particle swarm optimization,Bandpass filters; Design; Digital communication systems; Errors; Evolutionary algorithms; Frequency response; Intelligent control; Learning algorithms; Notch filters; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Signal processing; Cuckoo search algorithms; Differential Evolution; Evolutionary computation techniques; Global searching capabilities; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Modern signal processing; Multiband; Signal processing applications; Optimization,"Dash, J.; Department of ECE, Silicon Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: jd.08@aol.in",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

Most of the time, theories about data or computational complexity limits the use of these methods. In order to perform fault diagnosis of a gearbox for fluctuating speeds, frequency domain averaging (FDA) of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) after their dynamic time warping (DTW) has been done in this paper. This will not only attenuate the effect of fluctuating speeds but will also extract the weak fault feature those masked in vibration signal. Experimentally signals were acquired from Drivetrain Diagnostic Simulator for different gear health conditions i.e., healthy pinion, pinion with tooth crack, chipped tooth and missing tooth and were analyzed for the different fluctuating profiles of speed. Kurtosis was calculated for warped IMFs before DTW and after DTW of the acquired vibration signals. Later on, the application of FDA highlights the fault frequencies present in the FFT of faulty gears. The result suggests that proposed approach is more effective towards the fault diagnosing with fluctuating speed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic time warping; Fault detection; Fluctuating speeds; Gear crack; Kurtosis,Cracks; Failure analysis; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Gears; Higher order statistics; Signal processing; Speed; Wavelet transforms; Dynamic behaviors; Dynamic time warping; Experimental evaluation; Gear fault diagnosis; Intrinsic Mode functions; Kurtosis; Signal processing technique; Time synchronous averaging; Fault detection,"Sharma, V.; Discipline of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology IndoreIndia; email: phd1301103010@iiti.ac.in",,Academic Press,8883270,,MSSPE,,English,Mech Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995532160

A large extant of mechanical faults is due to the bearings which makes identification of malfunctions in nascent condition, a research area of higher importance. Motor Current Signature Analysis emerges as a valuable tool for the purpose. Further, for the purpose of signature extraction, Wavelet Transform also gained importance as a signal processing technique due to its well known property of Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA). It prevails over the major snag of frequency domain technique that is resolution problem. In this paper, stator current signal at no load condition is used for the purpose of fault diagnosis. Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is used as signal processing tool and artificially created signals are used to test formula while a set of damaged bearings is used to get the required data of fault conditions for testing the proposed methodology practically.

Though the vector control of induction motor is fast and efficient for variable speed operation, it is not worth using in applications such as electric vehicles where changes in speeds are not as fast as in servo applications. The proposed controller uses an improved form of traditional scalar methodology with the addition of current loop. The motor torque is varied in terms of motor control voltage in closed current loop using dc current sensor. The improved scalar works in a closed loop for automatic adjustment of torque value and does not use any external speed sensor. A multi-slope voltage/frequency (V/Hz) ramp allows the induction motor to operate in the required torque-speed profile of the EV at its optimum efficiency values in all operating conditions. Initially, the effectiveness of the improved scalar control algorithm is evaluated by conducting appropriate simulations. The control algorithm is developed on TMS320F28335 digital signal processor from Texas Instruments. The hardware performance of the developed improved scalar controller is matching well with the simulated results. © 2016 IEEE.",Electric Vehicle; EV Controller; Induction Motor Control; Motor Controller; Scalar Control; Vector Control,Controllers; Digital signal processors; Electric machine control; Electric vehicles; Induction motors; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Signal processing; Traction motors; Vehicles; Automatic adjustment; Design and Development; Hardware performance; Induction motor control; Motor controllers; Operating condition; Scalar control; Variable speed operations; Vector control (Electric machinery),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In order to add or remove functionalities of the composite services and to reduce the human intervention, the service composition process should be dynamic, scalable, and reusable. For the purpose, this paper proposes a Colored PetriNet based approach for service composition. In the proposed mechanism, firstly, a conceptual model of service interface has been devised. Based on the conceptual model a Colored PetriNet (CPN) based model, called Colored PetriNet for Service Composition (CPSC) has been proposed to represent the behavioral aspects of the conceptual constructs of service interfaces and different composition aspects of the constituent services. It also implements a service composition algorithm to execute the composition sequence of services. Moreover, the proposed CPSC along with the algorithm are illustrated with a suitable case study and simulated using CPN tool. The result shows that the proposed algorithm can successfully compose services based on the user requirements. Beside these, the state space report of the proposed CPSC validates the standard behavioral properties of the concerned system. © 2017 IEEE.",Service Composition; Service Composition Pattern; Service Composition Variation; Service Oriented System,Quality of service; Signal processing; Behavioral properties; Colored petri net (CPN); Composite services; Human intervention; Service composition patterns; Service composition process; Service compositions; Service Oriented Systems; Telecommunication services,,Bao V.N.Q.Duong T.Q.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

It has been observed that dynamic visualization of power system cannot be achieved effectively by the use of the SCADA system because of the low sampling rate. But, paradigm shift in grid monitoring, online fault detection and offline post disturbance analysis can be achieved with the introduction of synchrophasor technology alternatively known as PMU. When the PMU is deployed in the grid, the grid dynamics can be monitored at sub-second level from the control centers. Power system faults is easily diagnosed by identifying the changes in PMU data using Wavelet based signal processing techniques. A new software tool has been developed to detect the PMU signal variations and to classify the disturbances based on the signatures associated with each disturbance. This information has been correlated with the Sequence of Event (SoE) message of SCADA to exactly locate the point of origin of the fault and time.

The proposed denoising approach combined the two methods, wavelet and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for removal of AWGN. In this method, noisy ECG signal is primarily decomposed using wavelet decomposition resulting in approximation sequence and detail sequence. The soft-thresholding method is then used to denoise the detail sequence. This gives the denoised detail sequence which, in conjunction with approximation signal gives partially denoised signal. The partially denoised signal have observed to have denoised QRS complexes but the remaining part of this signal still have noises. The EMD decomposes this signal into several IMFs. The denoised QRS complex is then detected and preserved from the first three IMFs. The noisy segments of the remaining IMFs (other than first three IMFs) is then detected with the help of instantaneous half period (IHP) and filtered using soft-thresholding technique.

In the proposed method, the cardiac sound signals have been compressed using TQWT, linear quantization, Huffman and run length coding (RLC) techniques. To begin with, the cardiac sound signals have been decomposed using TQWT. Then, a dynamic threshold has been applied on the obtained wavelet coefficients to achieve distortion error in acceptable range. The wavelet coefficients above the threshold and the corresponding binary significant map have been compressed by steps involving zero removal, linear quantization/RLC and Huffman coding. Optimal values of the compression parameters have been found using genetic algorithm (GA) with a subset of dataset. The performance of these optimized values of compression parameters have been evaluated using a test set. The proposed compression method has provided significant compression performance with lower distortion for various clinical cases as comprised in the publicly available dataset.

Cough is often triggered by the mucus that drains down the back of the throat. An infection in the lungs or upper airway passages can cause cough. This paper describes the characteristics of ailment (cold) cough with respect to simulated (healthy) cough sound signals. Standard signal processing methods are used to extract the features from the acoustic signal of cough sounds that characterize the cough sounds. Analysis of cough sounds is carried out using the instantaneous fundamental frequency (F0) as a source feature, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as filter features, and signal energy as a combined feature of both the source of excitation and the vocal tract system. First four formants of the human speech production mechanism are also used for characterizing the ailment cough vs. simulated cough. Further a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for the automated classification of the ailment cough sound from the simulated cough sound signal. Encouraging results are obtained. The proposed approach can have potential applications in assisted diagnosis of diseases, based upon cough sound signal analysis. © 2016 IEEE.",ailment cough; Cough; DCT; DFT; formants; instantaneous fundamental frequency; MFCC; simulated cough,Diagnosis; Natural frequencies; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; ailment cough; Cough; formants; Fundamental frequencies; MFCC; simulated cough; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015428731

Many attempts of transcribing polyphonic music have been made in the past but monophonic tones, that build melodious music pieces, still remain largely untouched. The foremost approach is preparation of a database consisting of isolated and continuous monophonic sounds in order to proceed with the recognition and transcription of monophonic music pieces. In this paper one such audio-visual database of monophonic guitar tones for multi-modal signal processing has been introduced and evaluated for a test case of both online and offline recognition and transcription. The database comprises of recorded audio samples of first nine frets for all six strings and images of different ways in which the fretboard was held while playing these frets.

In the literature, Deep learning concepts have not been applied to EEG data analysis in a systematic manner. This paper applies various existing Deep learning architectures and algorithms for the classification of EEG data applied to eye state detection. The deep learning based classifier systems presented in this work are comparable to the state of the art classifiers devised by Roesler and Suenderman (2013), and Cameron et al.(2015). The goal of this work is to construct a system producing accuracies comparable to Roesler's K? classifier, Cameron et al.'s (RRF+K?) classifiers and at the same time providing enough speed to be used in an online BCI framework. In order to meet the constraints, following architectures were designed: A Multi layered neural network with ReLU and drop-out, deep belief networks based unsupervised learning, drop-out masks on deep neural networks. Specifically, we compare our results with K?, RRF, (K?+RRF), ada(RJ48F) classifiers. Also an in-depth analysis of binary class features has been done using t-SNE based visualizations while fitting elliptical contours to the features. Prior research suggests that instance-based/lazy learners like the K? algorithm are likely to be too slow to be used in a BCI framework, with ada(RJ48F) model performing decently well. But our chosen deep neural network architectures produce higher classification accuracies and have lower convergence times making them even faster within the time specifications of real-time classification and control applications. © 2016 IEEE.",Drop-out; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Eye-state; Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM),Cybernetics; Deep neural networks; Drops; Electroencephalography; Network architecture; Network layers; Neural networks; Real time systems; Signal processing; Classification accuracy; Drop-out; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Eye-state; Learning architectures; Multilayered neural networks; Real-time signal processing; Restricted boltzmann machine; Deep learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This obscures the features of LS signals and creates confusion on pathological states, if any, of the lungs. In this work, a new method is proposed for reduction of heart sound interference which is based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique and prediction algorithm. Method In this approach, first the mixed signal is split into several components in terms of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Thereafter, HS-included segments are localized and removed from them. The missing values of the gap thus produced, is predicted by a new Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based prediction algorithm and the time domain LS signal is reconstructed by taking an inverse FFT of the estimated missing values. Results The experiments have been conducted on simulated and recorded HS corrupted LS signals at three different flow rates and various SNR levels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results. Conclusions It is found that the proposed method is superior to the baseline method in terms of quantitative and qualitative measurement. The developed method gives better results compared to baseline method for different SNR levels.

Both these techniques, at certain time scales (sometimes for the entire time scales, in the case of RMSE), assign higher entropy to the HRV time series of certain pathologies than that of healthy subjects, and to their corresponding randomized surrogate time series. This incorrect assessment of signal complexity may be due to the fact that these techniques suffer from the following limitations: (1) threshold value r is updated as a function of long-term standard deviation and hence unable to explore the short-term variability as well as substantial variability inherited in beat-to-beat fluctuations of long-term HRV time series. (2) In RMSE, entropy values assigned to different filtered scaled time series are the result of changes in variance, but do not completely reflect the real structural organization inherited in original time series. In the present work, we propose an improved RMSE (I-RMSE) technique by introducing a new procedure to set the threshold value by taking into account the period-to-period variability inherited in a signal and evaluated it on simulated and real HRV database. The proposed I-RMSE assigns higher entropy to the age-matched healthy subjects than that of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, sudden cardiac death and diabetes mellitus, for the entire time scales.

Traditional implementations have been using application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or DSP processors. However, the increase in logic capacity and versatility of the field programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms has made it possible to realize numerically intense algorithms and thus provide a complete system-on-chip (SoC) solution in a single package. With modern FPGAs fast moving from prototype designing to low and medium volume productions, it becomes imperative to consider architectural optimizations that are specific to FPGAs only. In this paper, for the first time, we attempt to optimize filtering structures by considering the technology-dependent approaches. We present a general procedure that can be used to efficiently map the Boolean networks onto FPGA fabric. Based on this procedure, a technology optimal realization of the multiply-adder unit, which is a fundamental functional unit in FIR filters is presented. Since no such implementation has been reported, we have compared our implementations against the various technology-independent optimizations that have been detailed in prior literature. Further, to give an idea about the performance speed-up achieved with our implementations, we have compared our results against the FIR structures based on the multiply-adder IP v 2.0, inherent in Xilinx FPGAs. A distinctive feature of our implementation is that a simultaneous speed-up is achieved in all three parameters (area, speed and power). This is in contrast to the technology-independent implementations where there is always a performance trade-off between different parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",FIR filters; FPGA realizations; Look-up table; Technology mapping; Technology-Dependent optimization; Ternary adder,Adders; Application specific integrated circuits; Bandpass filters; Digital signal processing; Economic and social effects; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Impulse response; Programmable logic controllers; Signal processing; System-on-chip; Table lookup; Digital signal processing (DSP); Filtering structures; Look up table; Optimal realization; Performance trade-off; Technology independent; Technology mapping; Various technologies; FIR filters,"Khurshid, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology SrinagarIndia; email: burhan_07phd12@nitsri.net",,Birkhauser Boston,0278081X,,CSSPE,,English,Circ Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010871644

This paper investigates the innovative concept of adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) using cascaded form of least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filters. The concept of cascading and its algorithm for real-time LMS-ANC are also described in detail. The model of the cascaded LMS-ANC is designed and simulated on MATLAB Simulink. The simulation model gives variation in the distinct signals of LMS-ANC like error, output and weights at various LMS filter parameters. The proposed algorithm utilizes two adaptive filters to estimate gradients accurately and results in good adaptation and performance. The objective of the present investigation is to provide solution in order to improve the performance of noise canceller in terms of filter parameters. The results are obtained with the help of adaptive algorithm with variable step size and different initial weight of filters which provides high convergence speed of error signal. This paper also includes the derivation for the convergence rate at different conditions and concludes that cascaded LMS-ANC results in higher convergence rate and better output signal as compared to single LMS-ANC.

Further, whether this identification can be carried out by a single musical note, like humans are able to do, is an interesting research issue that has several potential applications in the music industry. Attempts have been made earlier using the spectral and temporal features of the music acoustic signals. The process of identifying the musical instrument from monophonic audio recording basically involves three steps - pre-processing of music signal, extracting features from it and then classifying those. In this paper, we present an experiment-based comparative study of different features for classifying few musical instruments. The acoustic features, namely, the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Spectral Centroids (SC), Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) and signal energy are derived from the music acoustic signal using different speech signal processing methods. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used with each feature for the relative comparisons. The classification results using different combinations of training by features from different music instrument and testing with another/same type of music instruments are compared. Our results indicate that the most significant feature for classifying Guitar, Violin and Drum is MFCC as it gives the better accurate results. Also, the feature which gives better accuracy results for the drum instrument is ZCR. Among the features used, after MFCC, ZCR proved to be the optimal feature for the classification of drum instrument. © 2016 IEEE.",autocorrelation; MFCC; monophonic; polyphonic; RMS; signal processing; spectral centroid; ZCR,Acoustic waves; Audio acoustics; Audio recordings; Autocorrelation; Classification (of information); Instrument testing; Musical instruments; Processing; Signal processing; Speech communication; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Classification results; Comparative studies; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; MFCC; monophonic; polyphonic; spectral centroid; Speech signal processing; Audio signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

With certain precautions during signal recording we can avoid both muscle and motion artifacts. The other noises can be reduced by preprocessing of the recorded ECG signal. In this paper, RPT is used for preprocessing, to reduce baseline wander noise, PLI and its harmonics. The proposed methodology is tested on a record from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database for different block sizes. A sum (E) of Euclidean errors per block (ei-ith block), is used as a measure to compare the results of RPT with notch filter technique.

The quality of reconstructed speech increases with the size of Gaussian codebook used for quantizing excitation sequences. But this results in increased transmission bit rate and search complexity of the codebook. This can be dealt with using tools from Compressed Sensing (CS) domain that transfers complexity of transmitter to space of sparse recovery at receiver. Sparse signal recovery gained much interest in signal processing research as it allows data sampling below Nyquist rate. A Compressive Sensing based CELP coder that allows bit rate scalability by varying the dimension of the measurement vectors is designed and implemented in this paper. Vector quantization of CS measurements and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients using Gaussian and LPC codebooks respectively resulted in a bit rate of 11.9kbps which is less than that of CELP coder of the same speech quality. By optimizing the number of bits allocated for parameters and interpolating the LP coefficients, the bit rate is further reduced to 8.1kbps without much degradation in the quality of the reconstructed speech. © 2016 IEEE.",analysis-by-synthesis; CELP; Compressed sensing; LPC; speech coding,Codes (symbols); Image coding; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Speech; Speech coding; Vector quantization; Analysis by synthesis; Bit-rate scalability; CELP; Code excited linear prediction; Linear Predictive Coding; Signal processing research; Sparse signal recoveries; Transmission bit-rate; Compressed sensing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

In this paper, a novel hybrid model involving machine learning and signal processing techniques is proposed for the diagnosis of heart sounds using Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. A dataset comprising of 175 normal and 91 abnormal PCG signals is used. The authors propose a modular approach comprising of four levels of classification supported by preprocessing and segmentation. Preprocessing employs minimum statistics approach to suppress noise and enhance signal quality. At every stage of classification, the signal is characterized by parameters from its time-frequency, spectral and statistical analyses. In the first level, normal heart sounds are separated from the abnormal, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier having 91.11% accuracy.

In epileptic patients, the seizures affect Heart Rate Variability (HRV). This emphasizes the importance of autonomic function changes in diagnosing epilepsy. The present work proposes an algorithm that classifies a person as epileptic or nonepileptic using ECG signal. Time Domain Features (TDF) and Frequency Domain Features (FDF), derived from the R-R Intervals (RRI) of ECG signal are utilized. In addition, Statistical Features (SF) are derived from extracted TDF and FDF. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used to classify the ECG signal as epileptic or nonepileptic based on the extracted TDF, FDF and SF. The classification accuracy of the proposed method exhibits 97.5%. Analysis on clinical data shows that the proposed combination of TDF, FDF and statistical HRV features gives excellent classification accuracy. These results indicate that the proposed method can be applied to wearable heart rate measuring devices for diagnostic purpose. © 2016 IEEE.",biomedical signal processing; classification algorithm; epilepsy; feature extraction,Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Electrocardiography; Feature extraction; Frequency domain analysis; Heart; Neurology; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Time domain analysis; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification system; Electrocardiogram signal; epilepsy; Heart rate variability; Statistical features; Time domain features; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

Recently, graph signal processing has been applied to source separation problem, in particular, electrical load disaggregation where, given smart meter measurements it is required to ascertain the contribution of multiple loads which could have resulted in those measurements. Inspired by these works, an attempt is made to adapt the results for real-life situations. Apart from incorporating pre-processing and post-processing stages, the disaggregation algorithm is appropriately modified to arrive at useful results for both load identification and consumption estimation. Both are important as disaggregation results, since the consumption information facilitates load prognostics/diagnostics and helps in giving advisory feedback to the consumers.

Digital filter design involves several multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations, which consume a large amount of hardware resources and computation cost. Distributed Arithmetic (DA) approach is proposed in literature as an alternative and efficient technique for MAC operation based designs. Similarly, reconfigurable computing possesses the benefits of both worlds, i.e., flexibility of software and high performance of hardware using flexible high speed computing fabric such as FPGA for efficient use of hardware resources. In this paper, design of FIR filters using the concepts of distributed arithmetic and reconfigurable computing is proposed. Two reconfigurable architectures are proposed and implemented on an SRAM based Xilinx FPGA board. The performance of proposed design is evaluated with and without reconfiguration architectures and their results are reported. It is observed that the proposed reconfigurable design saved 41.6-86.9% of hardware resources and 67.92% of power over the conventional non-reconfigurable design. © 2016 IEEE.",Digital filters; Distributed Arithmetic; FPGA; Reconfigurable system,Bandpass filters; Computer hardware; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); FIR filters; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Reconfigurable architectures; Signal processing; Structural design; Digital filter design; Digital signal processing techniques; Distributed arithmetic; Multiply and accumulate operations; Reconfigurable computing; Reconfigurable designs; Reconfigurable filters; Reconfigurable systems; Reconfigurable hardware,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

SDR needs reconfigurable FIR filter with animatedlyprogrammable filter coefficient. In FIR filter, the multiplication is done between one specific variable (the input) and several constants (the coefficients) and identified as multiple constant multiplications (MCM). An effectual VHBCSE algorithm for FIR filter is employed for 4 bit in addition to 8 bit common sub-expression elimination.4 bit BCSE is applied perpendicularly across neighboring coefficients of the coefficient matrix in the starting and variable-bit BCSE algorithm horizontally within each coefficient. Key goal of this algorithm are, to decrease the normal switching activity of the multiplier and adder blocks. The next goal is to minimize the power consumption with development in the area power product(APP). In some cases, the reliability of filters is critical, and fault tolerant filter implementations are required. Various techniques to achieve fault tolerance were proposed. In complex systems, it is common that some of the filters function in parallel. The parallel filters can be secured using error correction codes (ECCs). In this technique each filter output remains the same of a bit in a traditional ECC. This novel scheme allows additional efficient security when the amount of parallel filters remainsenormous. © 2016 IEEE.",Binary Common Sub-expression Elimination (BCSE); Error Correction Codes; Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM),Audio acoustics; Audio signal processing; Audio systems; Codes (symbols); Digital filters; Error correction; Errors; Fault tolerance; Signal processing; Video signal processing; Wave filters; Channel equalization; Common subexpression elimination; Constant multipliers; Error correction codes; Error correction codes (ECCs); Filter coefficients; Multiple constant multiplications; Switching activities; FIR filters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Hence more research is required to figure out nature's electric and magnetic behavior and its changeability to forecast its future transformation. Lightning is a proof that our environment is permanently electrified. However electric fields due to lightnings are not easy to detect due to various turbulences and interferences in the atmosphere. This results into false alarms or sometimes lightning event may be missed. In this paper a trial is made to identify lightning e-fields using waveform parameters in time domain along with HHT filtering. For example, lightning electric field signal mixed with some random noise signal won't show typical waveform parameters. Using HHT, signal components can be filtered. Filtered signal shows similar waveform parameters.

The NN can complement the analytical models according to their needs to provide further increased model accuracy, while maintaining the meaningful trends successfully captured in the analytical models.

The brain serves to control and coordinate the mental and physical actions. It has the capacity to store innumerable data. This data includes not only childhood memories but also those related to the present age. Tracking the electrical potentials or impulses, commonly known as brain waves, can be utilized for various purposes ranging from diagnosing diseases to decoding personality traits. This can be done using the technique of Electroencephalography (EEG). The amount of data available is exploding so also the opportunities of data mining thereby mounting privacy risks. The current practice either prevents the reuse of raw EEG signals or disrespects participants' right to privacy by using this data for purposes other than those consented to, by the individual. The aim of this work is to put a stop to such privacy risks by extracting and transferring only those features related to an application. Feature is a specific characteristic measurement of a pattern segment. EEG signal processing pertains mainly to feature extraction. There are different methods for extracting features from EEG signals. In this work, the features related to neurological diseases, namely epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, are extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and those related to Schizophrenia are extracted using Autoregressive (AR) method. For securing the raw data, it is doubly encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and is kept under the control of each user.

Many researchers have come up with various multipliers such as array, Booth, carry save, Wallace tree and modified Booth multipliers. However, for the present day applications Vedic multipliers based on Vedic Mathematics are presently under focus due to their high speed and low power consumption. In this paper, we propose a design of 8 -bit multipliers using fast adders (carry save adder, koggestone adder and carry-select adder) to minimize the power delay product of multipliers intended for highperformance applications.

The proposed antenna is able to work in two frequency bands i.e. from 6.27-6.97 GHz and 15.73-19.38 GHz with corresponding resonant frequencies of 6.57 and 17.61 GHz. The impedance bandwidth obtained for both operating bands is 0.703 GHz and 3.64 GHz respectively. High gain of 9.04 dB and 7.82 dB for both bands is obtained. Due to the Spidron defected ground structure, the decrease in the resonant frequency can be seen.

It sends out stimulus in the form of electrical pulses to different parts of the brain. These electrical pulses are recorded by a procedure known as Electroencephlography. EEG signal acquisition usually last for 2-8 hours, or can be extended over a week. This places a bigger problem on storage requirements as well as transmission of EEG. So, EEG signal compression is attaining more interest on medical field. EEG data needs to have more clinical importance as it deals with a patients health, hence requires an effective compression system involving perfect reconstruction of signal. The proposed method includes processing, band separation of EEG signal and identifying wavelets suitable for efficient compression of EEG.

The speed of the multipliers affects the speed of the DSPs. The execution of most DSPs is dependent on its multipliers, and hence need for high-speed multipliers arises. In this digitalization era, it becomes necessary to increase the speed of the digital circuits while reducing on-chip area and memory consumption. Latency and throughput are the basic parameters associated with multiplication algorithms where latency is a total delay in computing a function while throughput is the measure of computations performed in a given stipulated time. For increasing multiplication speed and reducing delay there is more and more emphasis on designing faster multipliers. There are many algorithms like standard modified booth algorithm, Wallace tree methods and several new techniques are worked on to enhance the speed of the multiplier. Among this, algorithms based on Vedic mathematics are under focused as they can be used to design faster and low power multipliers. Vedic mathematics is based on sixteen sutras, out of them 'Urdhva Tiryakbhyam' and 'Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah' are noticed most.

In this work, signals are uniformly decomposed to form a set of uniform matrices. Then using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) each pair matrices are mapped to orthogonal space. Next, Wavelet transformation is performed on original feature matrices and then mapped to orthogonal space. Both domains are statistically independent. From each domain, same dimensional feature vectors are extracted and concatenated them to form single embedding vectors. The embedding vectors are fed to classifier to recognize the healthy control and pathological signal patterns. For demonstration, we consider three groups of EMG signal vis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Myopathy (Myo) and healthy control (Nor). Results indicate that adopted feature extraction technique and synchronization of features strongly enhances the quality of feature pattern. The optimum recognition rate under adopted feature technique are obtained 95.91%±3.6% and 95.58%±1.5 % in Myo-Nor and ALS-Nor respectively. The proposed feature extraction scheme is consistent not only in accuracies but also other quality assessment parameters.

The contrast of an image is increased by HE. But HE fails to produce satisfactory results for wide range of low contrast images, because HE does not use a spatial feature that is included in an original image. In order to overcome this disorder the differential gray-levels histogram equalization (DHE) has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the DHE to color image processing. Then, hue and intensity information are taken into account for color image enhancement. Hue component is used for intensity processing. Even by keeping the intensity constant we can capture the edge by changing the hue. First the processing is done with intensity component and then with hue component. Finally intensity and hue component results are combined to produce better results. The proposed method has one parameter which controls the enhancement property of the color image. The guideline for the decision of the parameter which is agreed by the human sense is also described. © 2016 IEEE.",color image processing; contrast enhancement; histogram equalization; hue; intensity,Color; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Image processing; Signal processing; Color image enhancement; Contrast Enhancement; Differential gray-levels histograms; Histogram equalizations; intensity; Intensity information; Low contrast image; Spatial features; Color image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Continuous hypertension screening seems to be a promising approach in order to take appropriate steps to alleviate hypertension-related diseases. Many studies have shown that physiological signal like Photoplethysmogram (PPG) can be reliably used for predicting the Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR). However, the existing approaches use a transmission or reflective type wearable sensor to collect the PPG signal. These sensors are bulky and mostly require an assistance of a trained medical practitioner; which preclude these approaches from continuous BP monitoring outside the medical centers. In this paper, we propose a novel touchless approach that predicts BP and HR using the face video based PPG. Since the facial video can easily be captured using a consumer grade camera, this approach is a convenient way for continuous hypertension monitoring outside the medical centers. The approach is validated using the face video data collected in our lab, with the ground truth BP and HR measured using a clinically approved BP monitor OMRON HBP1300. Accuracy of the method is measured in terms of normalized mean square error, mean absolute error and error standard deviation; which complies with the standards mentioned by Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Two-tailed dependent sample t-test is also conducted to verify that there is no statistically significant difference between the BP and HR predicted using the proposed approach and the BP and HR measured using OMRON. © 2016 IEEE.",,Biomedical equipment; Blood pressure; Diagnosis; Errors; Heart; Hospitals; Mean square error; Signal processing; Wearable sensors; Cardio-vascular disease; High blood pressures; Hypertension monitoring; Medical instrumentation; Medical practitioner; Normalized mean square error; Physiological signals; Statistically significant difference; Multimedia signal processing,"Jain, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: monikaj@iiitd.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Elimination of such unwanted components termed as noise from transmitted signals has remained an important as well as puzzling task for the researchers since the preliminary days of Digital Signal Processing. Among a significant number of techniques proposed for removal of noise from signals, use of digital filters has become most effective in multiple ways. Slighter overheads in designing and lower hardware cost have made the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters popular. Among a considerable number of techniques, use of different window functions for implementation of digital filters is most acceptable. In this paper a new strategy based on the weight lifting strategy of ants has been proposed for optimizing parameters to design a digital filter using Kaiser Window function. A new innovative objective function has been introduced for optimization that performs based on the signal de-noising capability of the filters implemented by the optimized sets of parameters. A case study was carried out on heart sound signals with a filter designed using Kaiser Window with optimized parameters. © 2016 IEEE.",Ant Weight Lifting; Cutoff frequency; Finite Impulse Response Filter; Passband ripple; Sampling frequency; Stopband attenuation,Artificial intelligence; Bandpass filters; Cutoff frequency; Digital filters; Digital signal processing; FIR filters; Impulse response; Objective functions; Optimized parameter; Optimizing parameters; Pass-band ripples; Sampling frequencies; Stopband attenuation; Time of transmission; Weight lifting; Signal processing,,Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The emerging technology of FANET has many applications in civilian and military field like search and rescue mission, surveillance, reconnaissance, monitoring etc. which create temporary mobile ad-hoc platform for communication and data collection. For such applications, main requirements are maintaining and sustaining connectivity with nodes and effective utilisation of limited resources like bandwidth. Further, as the UAVs are moving with very high velocity, their topology changes rapidly and hence connectivity among them may lose. To address this problem, usage of novel technique called compressed sensing is proposed. In compressed sensing method, instead of sampling the signal by Nyquist rate, signal is sampled by Sub-Nyquist rate i.e. sampling rate less than Nyquist rate. Thus, few samples are transmitted and signal can be recovered by using convex optimisation technique. In FANET, number of UAVs are few. Hence, number of frequencies occupied will be sparse as compared to available wide spectrum band. In this paper, sparsity in form of number of UAVs is exploited and compressed sensing is implemented on coordination information which is shared between nodes. © 2016 IEEE.",Combine normalised distance vector; Compressed Sensing; Connectivity; Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET); Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP); Sparsity,Ad hoc networks; Artificial intelligence; Compressed sensing; Convex optimization; Military applications; Signal processing; Connectivity; Distance vector; Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET); Orthogonal matching pursuit; Sparsity; Signal reconstruction,,Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Speed is the factor which always depends upon clock frequency. Computation time of digital circuit can be reduced by applying transformation of delay that is retiming to digital signal block, which can be applied to digital signal processing blocks that can reduce computation time. For transformation of delay we need critical path and shortest path computation algorithm. Clock period minimization techniques of retiming used to minimize clock period of the circuit like Infinite impulse response, Finite impulse respons (IIR, FIR) filters. We have computed critical path before applying retiming in circuit, it gives us an estimation of computing time. Shortest path algorithms are required in the circuit for solving shortest path problem in the graph. We are explaining clock period minimization technique of retiming to enhance speed and proposing new shortest path algorithm. Existing method contain Floyd-Warshall(all pair shortest path) and Bellman Ford algorithms (single point shortest path)which are used in retiming. We are giving new Dijkstra algorithm(single point shortest path algorithm)instead of bellman ford algorithm because it has less run time complexity and high speed. We also observed that most of filter data flow graph are sparse. Then we have chosen Johnson algorithm (all pair shortest path) because run time complexity of it is less than Floyd-Warshall which are existing algorithm.

Relatively less effort has been put to the development and analysis of features that are particularly suited for the task. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper proposes two features that can efficiently capture the emotion-related properties in music. These features are named compressibility and sparse spectral components. These features are designed to capture the overall affective characteristics of music (global features). We demonstrate that they can predict emotional dimensions (arousal and valence) with high accuracy as compared to generic audio features. Secondly, we investigate the relationship between the proposed features and the dynamic variation in the emotion ratings. To this end, we propose a novel Haar transform-based technique to predict dynamic emotion ratings using only global features. © 2016 IEEE.",affect; features; music; prediction,Forecasting; Learning systems; Signal processing; Accurate prediction; affect; Computational work; Emotional dimensions; features; Multiscale predictions; music; Spectral components; Multimedia signal processing,"Kumar, N.; Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL), University of Southern CaliforniaUnited States",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Therefore it is going to be backbone of future broadband network. Multi-cell Massive MIMO system reused orthogonal pilot sequence which results in pilot contamination. Pilot contamination causes poor channel estimation at the BS and degrades the performance of the system. In the proposed scheme downlink performance is improved by using fractional frequency reuse for pilot signal. All the available pilot signals are equally divided among the cells as per the cluster size (N=1, 3, 7). BS estimates the channel on receiving the uplink pilot signal transmitted by each user terminal. For each user terminal beam forming vector is calculated which is the function of estimated channel to transmit the downlink data. Uplink Pilot Signal to Interference Plus Noise (PSINR), SINR and terminal capacity for the downlink are calculated for the given number of user terminals using linear precoding schemes which are the function of the estimated channel.

This performance analysis yields to adaptive modulation technique which can be used to attain high spectral efficiency by modulating the signal at higher order modulation schemes based on channel state information (CSI) from the receiver. Signal over AWGN channel is assumed for the analysis. To achieve lower BER values for a specific SNR, techniques to alter signal characteristics like pulse shaping filters, matching filters and convolution encoding are applied and analysis are carried out. An observation from the above analysis produces lower BER. For 256-QAM at SNR of 20, BER of 4.76X10-3 and grey coded BER of 3.83X10-4 is obtained. Highest possible modulation technique is selected with lower BER obtained. Thus, spectral efficiency which is the prime objective of the proposed paper is achieved.

Ground vibrations generated due to blasting operations in mines and quarries are very important environmental aspect to be looked into by the researchers. It is clear that a small amount of total explosive energy is being utilized in blasting for breakage of rock mass while the rest is being wasted. The amount of energy which is wasted causes various environmental issues such as ground vibrations, air over pressure and fly rock. Ground vibrations caused by blasting cannot be totally eliminated, yet they can be minimized as far as possible through a suitable blasting methodology. Considerable amount of work has been done to identify ground vibrations and assess the blast performance in terms of the intensity of ground vibrations. However, not much research has gone into the seismic energy and utilizing this energy in understanding performance of blast rounds. In this paper, an attempt was made for the estimation of seismic energy dissipated at different distances from the blast site using Signal Processing Techniques with the help of DADiSP and Advanced Blastware software in three different formations, viz. Limestone, Sandstone and Underground Coal Mine. In total, 116 blast vibration events from Limestone Mines, 96 blast vibration events from Underground Coal Mine and 43 blast vibration events from Sandstone Mines were collected using ground vibration monitors for Signal Processing Analysis of Seismic Energy. Blast induced ground vibrations were recorded in three orthogonal directions collecting 2100-2500 particle motion samples for each. © 2016 IEEE.",Advanced blastware; Dadisp signal processing software; Discrete fourier transformation (DFT); Ground vibrations; Power spectrum density; Rotational kinetic energy; Seismic energy; Signal processing technique,Blasting; Coal; Coal mines; Discrete Fourier transforms; Explosives; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Limestone; Quarries; Sandstone; Seismology; Vibration analysis; Advanced blastware; Discrete fourier transformation; Ground vibration; Power spectrum density; Rotational kinetic energy; Seismic energy; Signal processing software; Signal processing technique; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

During the last decade various methodologies have been introduced which utilizes BCG signal for medical field and shown their advantages. In this field, various devices also introduced such as beds, chairs and weighing scales have been proposed to improvise the BCG acquisition, but there is a main issue faced in the BCG signal processing is noise, which is generated due to motion artifacts, vibration of the devices, echoes etc. these noises effects the quality of signal.

Previous studies have shown that Arrhythmia can further lead to major cardiac diseases like the Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) syndrome. The difficulty in detecting Arrhythmia in the early stages often results in poor prognosis and presents the need for a costefficient diagnostic device. To this end, we propose a realtime portable ECG device with special emphasis on Arrhythmia detection and classification. The device is centered on a Raspberry Pi 3 (RasPi) module. RasPi with its signal processing and wireless transfer capabilities acts like an adapter between the sensors and a personalized mobile device application that is used for tracking the ECG. A highly sensitive peak detection algorithm was used by RasPi to detect and extract features from the ECG signals at real time. The peak detection algorithm was tested on the standard MITBIH arrhythmia database and reported an accuracy of greater than 95%.

Color image watermarking has become essential as most of the images used are colored. A novel multiple composite digital image watermarking technique for color images is proposed in this paper. We have exploited the high embedding capacity property of Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It is more robust technique of watermarking multiple images in a single color image. Three different binary watermarks are taken as three channels and are combined to form single composite color watermark. The composite color watermark is further embedded in the color image using LSB technique. Simulation results exhibit that our proposed method has higher PSNR values indicating good visual quality of watermarked image. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust under signal processing and geometric attacks. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.,Digital image watermarking; LSB; Multiple images; PSNR,Color; Computation theory; Copyrights; Digital watermarking; Intelligent computing; Signal processing; Watermarking; Color image watermarking; Copyright protections; Digital image watermarking; Embedding capacity; Least significant bits; Multiple image; PSNR; Watermarked images; Image watermarking,"Priyanka; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: priyankasingh401@gmail.com",Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

They are generally less flexible and are simply designed to gather sound energy and direct it into the ear canal at higher volumes. But with the availability of miniature microphone sensors and extremely low power digital signal processors, hearing aids can be constructed with audiometric and cognitive intelligence that matches the hearing loss, physical features and lifestyle of the wearer, thus delivering more value and benefit for the hearing impaired person.

These impulselike excitations are often referred as epochs or glottal closure instants (GCIs). The zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method exploits the properties of impulse-like excitation by passing a speech signal through the resonator whose pole pair is located at 0 Hz. As the resonator is unstable, the polynomial growth/decay is observed in the filtered signal, thus requiring a trend removal operation. It is observed that the length of the window for trend removal operation is critical in speech signals where there are more fluctuations in the fundamental frequency (F0). In this paper, a simple finite impulse response (FIR) implementation is proposed. The FIR filter is designed by placing large number of zeros at fs 2 Hz (fs represents the sampling frequency), closer to the unit circle, in the z-plane. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust and computationally less complex when compared to the ZFF method.

As the window characteristics depends upon the type of the function and length of window used, hence, this is necessary to choose a particular window function and window length depending upon the applications. In other hand, real-time implementation of window function demands efficient and flexible very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) architecture. Hence, this paper presents a new hardware efficient coordinate-rotation-digital-computer (CORDIC)-based VLSI architecture which is capable of reconfigurability to choose a window function among aforesaid popular window functions and window length ranging from 8 to 32 K (215), depending upon the application.

The performance of FCM degrades at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the non-spherical energy values at fusion center (FC). The proposed work explores the scope of possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM) algorithm in noisy data set. PFCM combines the fuzzy membership function and the possibilistic information in the clustering process to partition the inseparable data into the respective clusters. The work also investigates the energy consumption by the secondary users (SUs) under the constraint of the predefined primary user (PU) detection threshold.

The term wind profiling radar is often used to emphasize the operational applications of the clear air radar technique and operating at lower and middle UHF bands. These radars can measure the wind profiles in the first few kilometers of the atmosphere. They include boundary layer convergence processes and their relationship to atmospheric convection, mountain drainage flows and urban pollution studies. This paper discusses denoising the wind profiler data using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Peak Detection Technique (PDT) and Daubechies wavelets.

Equally important is the correlation operation. The time domain community often teaches convolution and correlation only with one dimensional time signals. That does not clearly demonstrate the effect of convolution and correlation between two signals. Instead if we consider two dimensional spatial signals, the convolution and correlation operations can be very clearly explained. In this paper, we propose a lecture demonstration of convolution and correlation between two spatial signals using the Fourier transform tool. Both simulation and optical experiments are possible using a variety of object transparencies. The demonstration experiments help to clearly explain the similarity and the difference between convolution and correlation operations.

Alternately, the speed of the FFT can be increased using Radix-2 decimation-in-frequency (DIF) FFT algorithm with Multipath Delay Commutator (R2MDC) architecture. In this paper, a novel FFT scheme which combines the R2MDC architecture with the serial version of mixed radix FFT scheme is proposed. To study the efficacy of this approach, an 8-point FFT is implemented using R2MDC architecture. Using this, 16-point, 32-point and 64-point FFTs are realized with the serial version of mixed radix scheme and also using only R2MDC architecture on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. From the implementation results, it is found that the hardware requirement for the proposed approach reduces by 25%53% at the cost of speed compared to the other schemes reported in the literature including that using only R2MDC architecture.

MWC is analogous to multiple correlation which results coherence of multiple independent signals on dependent one. It describes the region of proportionate wavelet power of independent signals. We extract 1D dependent signals generated due to shoulders and hand movement and independent signals generated due to leg movement. We compute MWC of each sequence of all 20 subjects of CASIA-A gait database walking at an angle 0° to the image plane. Experimental results show that MWC preserves significant discriminant information of walking individual.

The proposed system makes use of the fact that when the speech signals are replayed, they pass through multiple channels as opposed to original recordings. This channel information is typically embedded in low signal to noise ratio regions. A speech signal processing method with high spectro - temporal resolution is required to extract robust features from such regions. The single frequency filtering (SFF) is one such technique, which we propose to use for replay attack detection. While SFF based feature representation was used at front-end, Gaussian mixture model and bi-directional long short-term memory models are investigated at the backend as classifiers. The experimental results on ASVspoof 2017 dataset reveal that, SFF based representation is very effective in detecting replay attacks. The score level fusion of back end classifiers further improved the performance of the system which indicates that both classifiers capture complimentary information Copyright © 2017 ISCA.",Bi-directional long short-term memory; Countermeasures; Gaussian mixture model; Replay attack; Single frequency filtering; Spoofing,Audio signal processing; Brain; Classification (of information); Gaussian distribution; Long short-term memory; Radar countermeasures; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Speech; Speech recognition; Bi-directional; Gaussian Mixture Model; Replay attack; Single frequency; Spoofing; Speech communication,,Lacerda F.Strombergsson S.Wlodarczak M.Heldner M.Gustafson J.House D.,International Speech Communication Association,2308457X,,,,English,"Proc.

Though some efforts are found for the English language, for regional languages like Bengali, Hindi, Guajarati etc. it is very rare or not started yet. Thus objectives of this work is to develop a method to identify isolated Bengali letter/alphabet (Swarabarna and Banjanbarna), from uttered sound. In speech processing, identifying a particular uttered letter consists of two major steps, Speech Feature Extraction and Feature Classification. Studies show that Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) give better representation of human auditory system, but at the same time with increased noise, performance of MFCC degrades, which may be reduced by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Thus MFCC combined with DWT is used as a feature termed as Mel Frequency Wavelet Transform Coefficient (MFWTC) for this work. For experiment, a sound database is developed by uttering of 43 Bengali alphabets {11 Swarabarna and 32 Banjanbarna} by ten speakers, 20 times for each letter. Then these signals are pre-processed to remove the silent portion from both end points followed by applying pre-emphasized filter. Next, MFCC features are extracted from preprocessed signals. These features are then fine-tuned by applying DWT to compute MFWTC features. Not only these feature, Zero Crossing Count(ZCC) are also used independently to compare with this method. Finally these features are used to recognize the Bengali Barnas using different classifiers (BayesNet, NaiveBayes, IB1, LWL, Classification Via Clustering, Dagging, Multi Scheme, VFI, Conjunctive Rule, ZeroR, BFTree and Simple Cart) available in Weka tools. The classification accuracy is measured using 10-fold cross validation method, which shows the average 47.61% and 62.19% for Swarabarna and Banjanbarna respectively. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.",Automatic letter identification; Bengali speech; Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC); Zero Crossing Count (ZCC),Artificial intelligence; Audition; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Speech processing; Wavelet transforms; 10-fold cross-validation; Bengalis; Classification accuracy; Feature classification; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Voice signal processing; Wavelet transform coefficients; Zero-crossing count; Speech recognition,"Phadikar, S.; Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, BF-142, Sector-I, India; email: sphadikar@yahoo.com",Mandal J.K.Mukhopadhyay S.Dutta P.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

For an exact signal reconstruction, both magnitude, and phase spectrum of the signal is required. In many speech-based applications, only the magnitude spectrum is processed and the phase is ignored, which leads to degradation in the performance. Here, we propose a novel technique that enables the reconstruction of the speech signal from magnitude spectrum only. We consider the even-odd part decomposition of a causal sequence and process only on the real part of the DTFT of the signal. We propose the shifting of the real part of DTFT of the sequence to make it non-negative. By adding a constant of sufficient value to the real part of the DTFT, the exact signal reconstruction is possible from the magnitude or power spectrum alone. Moreover, we have compared our proposed approach with recently proposed phase retrieval method from magnitude spectrum of the Causal Delta Dominant (CDD) signal. We found that the method of phase retrieval from CDD signal and proposed method are identical under certain approximation. However, proposed method involves the less computational cost for the exact processing of the signal.

The major concern is electro-oculogram (EOG) signal present in a recorded EEG signal, which appears due to abrupt eye movements. In the presented method, we use separately recorded horizontal EOG (HEOG) and vertical EOG (VEOG) signals as two reference inputs, which are processed using finite impulse response (FIR) filters. The linear filter coefficients are adaptively updated using a numerical variable forgetting factor (NVFF) recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which tracks nonstationary EOG signals. Subsequently, the processed HEOG and VEOG signals are subtracted from recorded EEG signal to obtain an artifact-free EEG signal. Simulation is conducted using synthetic EEG signal corrupted by noise, synthetic HEOG and VEOG signals. The real-time recorded EEG signal (corrupted by EOG and noise) is also refined using the separately recorded reference EOG signals and FIR filtering technique. For synthetic and real-time signals, the simulation results are presented to demonstrate that linear NVFF-RLS algorithm-based artifact and noise excision technique outperforms conventional fixed forgetting factor RLS, fixed step-size NLMS and generalized variable step-size NLMS algorithms, in terms of the reduction in mean-squared error, under low as well as high signal-to-noise ratio conditions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Artifacts; EEG; EOG; Fixed forgetting factor (FFF); Fixed step-size (FSS); Generalized variable step-size (GVSS) algorithm; Normalized least mean square (NLMS); Numeric variable forgetting factor (NVFF); RLS,Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Communication channels (information theory); Electroencephalography; Eye movements; FIR filters; Impulse response; Mean square error; Signal filtering and prediction; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Artifacts; Fixed step sizes; Forgetting factors; Generalized variables; Normalized least mean square; Variable forgetting factors; Biomedical signal processing,"Kohli, A.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: drkohli_iitr@yahoo.co.in",,Birkhauser Boston,0278081X,,CSSPE,,English,Circ Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009804803

Sanyal School of Telecommunication, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India","The tremendous increase in wireless data rate over the past few decades can be attributed to the use of higher frequency bands and increased density of access points along with advanced signal processing in transceiver. With the use of higher bands and increased access point density, terrestrial wireless communication systems are encountering more and more line-of-sight conditions than systems of earlier era. Moreover modern era of communication systems is generally designed to adapt transmission parameters dynamically. Such adaptations are done based on estimation of channel statistics. The measure of line-of-sight (Rician K-factor) is one of such statistics. It plays a vital role in estimating fade statistics, which influences the bit error rate, spectral efficiency, level crossing rate, average fade duration and so on. These factors significantly influence design of communication systems. This paper focuses on analytical computation of Rician K-factor of multi-clustered propagation channel models including antenna gain-patterns. Rician K-factor in different wireless channel models, which are based on the indoor channel model given by Saleh and Valenzuela and the channel model for IEEE 802.11ad standard have been calculated and compared with simulations. We show that, channel model provided explicit Rician factor does not agree with actual K-factor experienced by a link when details such as directivity of clusters and antenna gains are considered. The difference results in erroneous estimate of system performance. It is seen that the estimates of the required signal to noise ratio per bit for a given modulation and coding schemes can be affected by as much as 4 dB in sub 6 GHz systems and as high as 5 dB for millimeter wave systems due to incorrect use of Rician K-factor for relevant links. Average channel capacity is affected by around 13% for high SNR links due to variation of Rician K-factor. © 2013 IEEE.",angle of arrival; angle of departure; antenna gains; line of sight; millimeter wave; MIMO; Multipath; Rician channel; Rician K-factor; time of arrival,Antennas; Bit error rate; Channel capacity; Error statistics; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Frequency bands; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Radio transceivers; Signal processing; Telecommunication links; Time of arrival; Wireless telecommunication systems; Angle of arrival; Angle of departures; Antenna gains; Line of Sight; Multipath; Rician channels; Rician k factors; Signal to noise ratio,"Mukherjee, S.; G.

The filter used should be efficient enough to remove the artifacts along with least deformation from the actual signal.

SGSF is selected so that disease diagnosis using saccade detection of EOG signal can be done accurately. The efficiency of proposed filter is tested in terms of signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio (SSNR) and real time computations.

Acoustic events such as vowel onset point (VOP) and vowel end point (VEP) can be used to detect precise vowel regions in a speech signal. In this paper, a technique is proposed to detect vowel regions based on these acoustic parameters in a continuous speech signal. Vowels possess significant energy content in the low frequency bands of speech. The initial phase of this method consists of speech signal processing using zero frequency filtering technique. Zero frequency filtered signal predominantly contains low frequency content of the speech signal as it is filtered around 0 Hz. This process is followed by the extraction of dominant spectral peaks from the magnitude spectrum around glottal closure regions of the speech signal. The vowel onset points and vowel end points are obtained by convolving spectrum of zero frequency filtered signal with first order Gaussian differentiator. The performance of the proposed vowel region detection method is compared with the existing state of art methods on TIMIT database. It is reported that this method produced relatively significant improvement in vowel region detection in clean and noisy environments. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",First order Gaussian differentiator; Magnitude spectrum; Vowel End Point (VEP); Vowel Onset Point (VOP); Zero frequency filtering,Frequency bands; Linguistics; Point contacts; Signal processing; Speech; Speech communication; Speech processing; Speech recognition; End points; Gaussians; Magnitude spectrum; Vowel onset points (VOP); Zero-frequency filtering; Audio signal processing,"Thirumuru, R.; Speech and Vision Lab (LTRC), International Institute of Information Technology HyderabadIndia; email: ramakrishna.thirumuru@research.iiit.ac.in",Prasath R.Gelbukh A.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Waves are introduced using Piezo-electric Wafer Active Sensors (PWAS) sensors, which are placed, at discrete locations in order to inspect damages in plates and the idea has the potential to be extended to assembled structures. Various actuator-sensor configurations are possible within the network in order to identify and locate damages. The ability to detect the smallest defects within a material domain depends upon the wavelength of the incident wave, wave propagation characteristics, noise, and uncertainty in various quantities of interest involved. However, complex geometric features in a component also contribute to mode conversions and scattering losses, which make it difficult to distinguish the signal packets in a time signal received at a receiver location. In a component with multiple rivet holes such as fuselage of an aircraft, one of important type of damages that are required to be inspected carefully in such assembled structures are the rivethole cracks and corrosion. Ultrasonic inspection is performed by measuring and characterizing the waves reflected or transmitted through the damage. With no apriori knowledge on orientation of such damages, but only probable zone of high importance of inspection prescribed from the design criteria and loads on the component, the inspection method requires employing complex signal processing algorithms to analyze the data and identify the effect of scattering. In addition, the damages cause varying degree of changes in ultrasonic wave signals. The signals change significantly when crack from a rivet is opened up under load whereas in unloaded condition, cracks are often hard to detect In this study we present the effect of crack under fatigue load on the signal parameters during different loading conditions. We first introduce a single hole on the component and then a fatigue crack is allowed to grow from the hole. We show the effect of growing crack on the ultrasonic signals through amplitude and phase modulation factors. This describes the effect of growing crack with respect to a reference signal measured before the crack was grown.",,Aircraft accidents; Characterization; Complex networks; Cracks; Damage detection; Fighter aircraft; Fuselages; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Inspection; Rivets; Safety engineering; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Structural health monitoring; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic testing; Ultrasonic waves; Wave propagation; Amplitude and phase modulations; Complex signal processing; Damage detection technique; Quantities of interests; Ultrasonic guided wave; Ultrasonic inspections; Ultrasonic wave signals; Wave propagation characteristics; Crack detection,"Mahapatra, D.R.; Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: droymahapatra@aero.iisc.ernet.in",Chang F.-K.Kopsaftopoulos F.,DEStech Publications,,9.78161E+12,,,English,"Struct.

Owing to their universal approximation property, neural networks have been utilized for approximating the unknown nonlinear profile of instantaneous load torque. The inherent computational complexity of the neural network based adaptive scheme has been circumvented through the use of orthogonal Chebyshev polynomials as basis functions. A detailed stability and transient performance analysis has been conducted using Lyapunov stability criteria. The proposed control scheme is shown to yield a superior output performance with enhanced robustness for wide variations in load torque and set-point changes, compared to existing conventional approaches based on adaptive backstepping. The theoretical propositions are verified on an experimental prototype using dSPACE, Control Desk DS1103 setup with an embedded TM320F240 Digital Signal Processor proving its applicability to real-time electrical systems. The efficiency of the proposed strategy is quantified using performance measures and are evaluated against the conventional adaptive backstepping control (ABSC) methodology.

The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMMHMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. In an earlier work, we had proposed the use of signal processing cues in tandem with GMM-HMM based forced alignment for boundary correction for building Indian language TTS systems. In this paper, we capitalise on the ability of robust acoustic modeling techniques such as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional deep neural networks (CNN) for acoustic modeling. The GMM-HMM based forced alignment is replaced by DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM based forced alignment. Signal processing cues are used to correct the segment boundaries obtained using DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM segmentation.

A statistical learning perspective for improved classification of faults using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been proposed. The protective scheme uses single end cur-rent data of three phases of line to detect and classify faults. A Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) wavelet transform is employed to decompose the signals acquired and further processed to extract statistical features. The statistical features learning algorithm utilizes a set of ANN structures with a different combination of Neural Network parameters to determine the best ANN topology for Classifier. The algorithm generates different fault patterns arising out of different fault scenarios and altering system parameters in the test system. The features are selected based on ANOVA F-test statistics to determine relevance and improve classification accuracy. The features thus selected from fault patterns are given to the Hybrid Wavelet-ANN structure. The ANN once trained on a part of data set is later tested on the other part of unseen patterns and further validated on rest of the patterns. To provide a comparative Support Vector Machine Classifier is used to classify the fault patterns. A 5 fold cross validation is used on the data set to check the accuracy of SVM. It is shown that the proposed method using Pattern Recognition using Hybrid structure provides a high accuracy with reliability in identifying and classifying fault patterns as opposed to SVM. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Foreground speech segmentation is the use of features to segment between foreground speech and background interfering sources like noise. Initially, the foreground and background segments are obtained from foreground speech segmentation by using the normalized autocorrelation peak strength (NAPS) of the zero frequency filtered signal (ZFFS) as a feature. The background segments are then considered for determining whether a particular segment is an indoor or outdoor audio sample. The mel frequency cepstral coefficients are obtained from the background segments of both the indoor and outdoor audio samples and are used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The use of foreground speech segmentation gives a promising performance for the indoor/ outdoor audio classification task.

Ideal binary mask (IBM) has set a gold standard for speech separation by suppressing the undesired speakers and also by increasing intelligibility of the desired speech. In this work, single frequency filtering (SFF) analysis is used to estimate the mask closer to IBM for speaker separation. The SFF analysis gives good temporal resolution for extracting features such as glottal closure instants (GCIs), and high spectral resolution for resolving harmonics. The temporal resolution in SFF gives impulse locations, which are used to calculate the time delay. The delay compensation between two microphone signals reinforces the impulses corresponding to one of the speakers. The spectral resolution of the SFF is exploited to estimate the masks using the SFF magnitude spectra on the enhanced impulse-like sequence corresponding to one of the speakers. The estimated mask is used to refine the SFF magnitude. The refined SFF magnitude along with the phase of the mixed microphone signal is used to obtain speaker separation. Performance of proposed algorithm is demonstrated using multi-speaker data collected in a real room environment.

Inter-subject variability and speed of the classifier is still a issue in MI-based BCIs. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a new classification method, spatial filtering based sparsity (SFS) approach for MI-based BCIs. The proposed method makes use of common spatial pattern (CSP) to spatially filter the MI signals. Then frequency bandpower and wavelet features from the spatially filtered signals are used to bulid two different over-complete dictionary matrix. This dictionary matrix helps to overcome the issue of inter-subject variability. Later, sparse representation based classification is carried out to classify the two-class MI signals. We analysed the performance of the proposed approach using publicly available MI dataset IVa from BCI competition III. The proposed SFS method provides better classification accuracy and runtime than the well-known support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) classification methods. This SFS method can be further used to develop a real-time application for people with special needs. © 2017, The Author(s).",BCI for motor impaired users; Brain computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Motor imagery (MI); Sparisty based classification,Beamforming; Brain computer interface; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Human computer interaction; Image classification; Interfaces (computer); Signal processing; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Common spatial patterns; High Degree of Freedom; Motor imagery; Motor impaired users; Over-complete dictionaries; Sparse representation based classifications; Biomedical signal processing,"Sreeja, S.R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: sreejasr@iitkgp.ac.in",Mallem M.Horain P.Achard C.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Hence to locate the desired user Direction of Arrival (DOA) of the signal needs to be estimated. This paper presents a parametric study of various DOA estimation algorithms on the uniform linear array (ULA) and also a comparative performance regarding resolution, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the number of snapshots, separation angle, etc. It starts with traditional methods of Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) algorithm. The subspace-based techniques use the eigenstructure of data covariance matrix. The different subspace-based techniques are Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Root-MUSIC, and Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT). However, simulation results show that the antenna array elements, SNR, the snapshots, coherent nature of signals, and separation angle between the two sources can affect the DOA estimation results. The result shows that MUSIC algorithm has comparatively better resolution than MVDR, Root-MUSIC and ESPRIT algorithms. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",DOA; ESPRIT; MUSIC; MVDR; Root-MUSIC,Antenna arrays; Covariance matrix; Directional patterns (antenna); Parameter estimation; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Smart antennas; Source separation; Wavelet analysis; Direction of arrival estimation; ESPRIT; Estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques; Minimum variance distortionless response; Multiple signal classification; MUSIC; MVDR; Root-MUSIC; Direction of arrival,"Ganage, D.; Department of E&TC, Sinhgad College of EngineeringIndia; email: dgganage@gmail.com",Luhach A.K.Raman B.Singh D.Lingras P.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

This paper proposes a two-stage framework for denoising EOG signals. The first stage approach is based on preserving the nature of eye movements while the second stage is based on the nature of noise (Gaussian or not). In the first stage, denoising is carried out using one out of four filtering methods, each filter being optimal for a particular EOG pattern. The four methods used in the first stage are linear bandpass filtering, stationary wavelet transform (SWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and median filtering. The Stage I framework selects the output that provides the highest estimated signal to noise ratio (SNR). In case, the Stage I filtering does not provide a significant SNR, the system uses Stage II filtering. In the second stage, we use two recursive state estimators, i.e. a Kalman filter and a particle filter for further denoising. The two-stage method is found to provide a better SNR as compared to a single stage method. © 2016",EMD; EOG; Kalman filter; Particle filter; SNR; SWT,Electrooculography; Eye movements; Frequency bands; Kalman filters; Mathematical transformations; Median filters; Monte Carlo methods; Signal denoising; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Tunneling (excavation); Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Band pass filtering; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Filtering method; Median filtering; Particle filter; State Estimators; Stationary wavelet transforms; Two-stage methods; Biomedical signal processing; algorithm; Article; electrooculogram; electrooculography; eye movement; filtration; human; noise; priority journal; signal noise ratio,"Dasgupta, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: anirban1828@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

This method also provides reliable information on microphysical parameters of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Raman lidar uses elastic and inelastic backscatter to derive the profiles of key atmospheric parameters. The prime advantage of this method is the direct determination of particle backscatter and extinction coefficients along with atmospheric water vapor simultaneously. The optical part of lidar system employs a set of wavelength separating mirrors and high-spectral-resolution interference filters to separate the vibrational Raman signals from the strong elastic backscattering signal. Since Raman signal strengths are weak in nature than compared to the elastic, the detected signals need to be recorded using a unique data acquisition system. The special data acquisition system uses both analog and photon counting electronics, which allows enhanced dynamic range in the measured signals. In order to achieve the enhancement in measured profiles, a gluing technique is required to apply between the signals of analog and photon counting.

EEGs play a key role in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures and neurological disorders. In this paper, multiple wavelet families for decomposition and reconstruction are explored and are compared based on risk functions and reconstruction measures. While dealing with the wavelets it is a difficult task to choose the correct/accurate wavelet for the given biosignal analysis. Various statistical properties were studied by the authors to check the suitability of various wavelets for normal and diseased EEG signal decomposition and reconstruction. The methodology was applied to 3 groups (63 subjects) consisting of both sexes and aged between 1 and 80 years: 1) normal healthy subjects, 2) patients with focal seizures, and 3) patients with generalized seizures. Our result shows that the Haar and Bior3.7 wavelets are more suitable for normal as well as diseased EEG signals, as the mean square error, mean approximate error, and percent root mean square difference of these wavelets are much smaller than in other wavelets.

With narrow spectral bandwidths and high radiometric resolutions built with ocean colour sensors (Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer-MODIS, Medium resolution imaging spectrometer-MERIS, Sea viewing wide field of view sensor-SeaWIFS, Ocean colour monitor-OCM) in order to extract small signal from the ocean upwelling radiance in the high background atmospheric scattering, more accurate representation of the SRF assumes significant importance. The SRF measurements are typically carried out at about 1nm intervals in the in-band spectral region and at about 10nm intervals in out of band regions. In this paper we investigated a detailed interpolation analysis of the SRF of Ocean Colour Monitor flown on-board Indian Oceansat-2 mission. Several methods have been reported in the literature. Of these, it is found that the OCM SRF data is best fitted with B-spline interpolation method, and hence was adopted in the present study. Criteria for resampling rate was worked out and spectral interpolation covering all the spectral regions was carried out. The interpolated data was analyzed in detail for band specific parameters (peak wavelength, centre wavelength and full width half maximum). We found that cubic B-spline based interpolation function is the optimal method for representing the SRF covering all the spectral regions in terms of arriving at a smooth function to compensate noise in the laboratory recording process, and also providing accurate interpolated values in the gaps between samples. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

The computing hardware plays a significant role in digital signal processing (DSP) and multimedia application; one such major computing hardware is multiplier. It is a practice to choose multiplier to compute square of an operand. Multiplication hardware requires more elementary computations which leads to performance degradation in terms of reversible performance metrics like quantum cost, garbage outputs, and ancilla inputs. Ancilla inputs and garbage outputs are overhead bits in a reversible circuit. Reversible quantum computers of many qubits are extremely difficult to realize, thus we propose garbageless circuit design for reversible square computation. The proposed design methodology is based on recursion. Recursion technique is adapted from Karatsubas recursive method to compute square of an operand; we designed inverse computation units to retrieve the inputs and obtain garbageless circuit.

The paper introduces a novel approach to provide rehabilitative support to patients suffering from neurological damage in their pre-frontal, parietal and/or motor cortex regions. An attempt to bypass the natural visual-motor pathway is undertaken using interval type-2 fuzzy sets to generate the approximate EEG response of the damaged pre-frontal/parietal/motor cortex from the occipital EEG signals. The approximate EEG response is used to trigger a pre-trained joint coordinate generator to obtain the desired joint coordinates of the link end-points of a robot imitating the human subject. The robot arm is here employed as a rehabilitative aid in order to move each link end-points to the desired locations in the reference coordinate system by appropriately activating its links using the well-known inverse kinematics approach. The mean-square positional errors obtained for each link end-points is found within acceptable limits for all experimental subjects including subjects with partial parietal damage, indicating a possible impact of the proposed approach in rehabilitative robotics. Subjective variation in EEG features over different sessions of experimental trials is modeled here using interval type-2 fuzzy sets for its inherent power to handle uncertainty. Experiments undertaken confirm that interval type-2 fuzzy realization outperforms its classical type-1 counterpart and back-propagation neural approaches in all experimental cases, considering link positional error as a metric.

The narrowband speech spectrogram is segmented into patches, which are represented as 2-D cosine carriers modulated in amplitude and frequency. Separation of carrier and amplitude/frequency modulations is achieved by 2-D demodulation using Riesz transform, which is the 2-D extension of Hilbert transform. The demodulated AM component reflects contributions of the vocal tract to spectrogram. The frequency modulated carrier (FM-carrier) signal exhibits properties of the excitation. The time-frequency coherence is defined with respect to FM-carrier and a coherence map is constructed, in which highly coherent regions represent nearly periodic and deterministic components of speech, whereas the incoherent regions correspond to unstructured components. The coherence map shows a clear distinction between deterministic and stochastic components in speech characterized by jitter, shimmer, lip radiation, type of excitation, etc. Binary masks prepared from the time-frequency coherence function are used for periodic-aperiodic decomposition of speech. Experimental results are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.

Filtering intended motion from tremor is a challenging task as the properties of tremor change with increasing muscle fatigue levels. Muscle fatigue induced hand tremor has highly nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics that need a filtering strategy different from the conventional filters. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) based filters have become popular in the recent past for its enhanced nonlinear signal handling capability. EMD based filtering strategy is case specific in nature as the EMD does not have any general analytical formulation unlike other (Kernel based) popular filtering techniques. In this work, we have addressed the tremor filtering issue with the help of EMD and the probability distribution characteristics analysis of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) of the tremulous laparoscopic tool trajectory. A modified distribution asymmetry measure was employed to find out the threshold IMF for reconstruction of tremor free motion at different fatigue levels. In order to find the robustness of the proposed technique, the compensation strategy has been tested extensively on synthetic signal and experimentally acquired signals. Filtering threshold at different fatigue levels was also demonstrated for various subjects. Despite the time-varying properties of tremor, the proposed filtering strategy substantiates its efficacy to diminish the effect of tremor which was not possible by the conventional fixed cut-off filtering techniques. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hand tremor filtering; KullbackLeibler Divergence; Muscle fatigue; Robot assisted surgery,Biomedical signal processing; Laparoscopy; Muscle; Probability distributions; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Analytical formulation; Distribution characteristics; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hand tremors; Intrinsic Mode functions; Muscle fatigues; Non-stationary characteristics; Robot-assisted surgery; Signal processing; adult; algorithm; Article; empirical mode decomposition; hand tremor; human; human experiment; laparoscopic surgery; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; measurement; motion; muscle fatigue; nonlinear system; priority journal; probability,"Thondiyath, A.; Department of Engineering Design, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: asok@iitm.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.
