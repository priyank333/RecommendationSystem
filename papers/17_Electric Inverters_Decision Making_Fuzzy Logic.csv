This paper presents a neural network-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller for 1.26-kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), supplying electric vehicle powertrain through a high voltage-gain DC-DC boost converter. The proposed neural network MPPT controller uses a radial basis function network (RBFN) algorithm for tracking the maximum power point of the PEMFC. High switching-frequency and high voltage-gain DC-DC converters are essential for the propulsion of FCEV. In order to attain high voltage-gain, a three-phase high voltage-gain interleaved boost converter is also designed for FCEV system. The interleaving technique reduces the input current ripple and voltage stress on the power semiconductor devices. The performance analysis of the FCEV system with RBFN-based MPPT controller is compared with the fuzzy logic controller in MATLAB/Simulink platform. © 2018 IEEE.","Fuel cell electric vehicle; High voltage gain IBC; MPPT; PEMFC; RBFN","Automotive industry; Carbon; Controllers; DC motors; DC-DC converters; Electric inverters; Electric motors; Electric switches; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Fuzzy logic; Gain measurement; Gas emissions; HVDC power transmission; Maximum power point trackers; Permanent magnets; Power converters; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Radial basis function networks; Semiconductor devices; Switches; Vehicles; Voltage control; Fuel cell electric vehicle; High switching frequencies; High voltage gain; Interleaved boost converters; Maximum power point tracking controller (MPPT); Permanent magnet motor; Radial basis function Networks (RBFN); RBFN; Electric machine control","Sudhakar, N.; School of Electrical Engineering, Vellore Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: nsudhakar@vit.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040026477

Various edge detection techniques are obtained like Sobel, PSO Preweitt, Laplacian and Laplacian of Gaussian. These techniques consume some restrictions such as fixed edge thickness and some parameter like threshold is problematic to implement. Although many different edge-detection methods have been proposed for gray-scale, color, and multispectral images, they still face difficulties when extracting edge features from hyperspectral images (HSIs) that contain a large number of bands with very narrow gap in the spectral domain. High performance computing (HPC) is a technique used to assemble process and analyze more quantity of remote sensing (satellite) data which needs less processing time. HPC method is used in distributed & cluster Computing, parallel computing and following satellite data analyzing & processing approaches like geo-referencing, image edge detection, image classification, image mosaicking, Morphological/neural approach and image fusion for hyperspectral satellite data. Stimulated by means of the specific clustering of theory called gravitational theory, an original edge detection process. The conservative methods include the usage of linear time invariant filters. Recognition of edge is done by these filters as a These filters recognize an edge as a sudden conversion of grey scale pixel intensity. These techniques are well recognized and computationally effective. Canny, Sobel, Robert, Kirsch, Prewitt and LOG, on idea of spatial differential filters by using local grade. Within the less time these filters process the data and are inclined to noise. But in fuzzy technique, it does not include like this restriction, by altering the rules and output parameters, it is possible to change the thickness of the edge. In this paper, a new technique is created on fuzzy logic, which is suggested for detection of edge in digital images deprived of finding the threshold value. This method starts through segmenting the images into sections by means of fluctuating 3 (Formula presented.) 3 binary matrixes. The pixels of edge are planned to a range of standards separated from each other. The results of this proposed technique is compared with the results obtained from PSO and neural network methods. This suggested technique provides a permanent effect in the lines smoothness and straightness for the straight lines and good roundness for the curved lines.

The inadequately damped electromechanical motions in power frameworks has been an issue to power engineers for quite a while. This restrains the ability of transfer of power in transmission lines and further incites worry in the mechanical shaft of machine. Owing to large scale interconnections and structured complexity of power systems, some disturbances arise which result in poorly damped low-frequency oscillations that don't damp out with time and at some occasions system is shaken out of equilibrium. The dynamics of this framework is additionally influenced by these oscillations at low frequency. The oscillations can be reduced and in turn the stability can be increased by proper design of controllers. The oscillations can be diminished and thus the solidness can be expanded by appropriate outline of controllers. The essential element of the proposed approach is plan of a fuzzy based PID controller (FPID) that uses a rearranged configuration. FPID controller, which exploits the properties of fuzzy PI and PD controllers, is proposed. This approach doesn't require exact learning of plant's characteristics for execution of the controller. The performance when compared with the conventional controllers, the results of fuzzy controller are quite encouraging and satisfactory. © 2017 IEEE.","A VR; FPID; Fuzzy logic; PID; PSS","Controllers; Electric control equipment; Electric power system stability; Fuzzy logic; Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; Water craft; A VR; Conventional controllers; FPID; Fuzzy tuned pid controllers; Large-scale interconnections; Low frequency oscillations; Power system stability; Power system stabilization; Electric power system control",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

The advantage of LS-PWM techniques over PS-PWMs is that they produce better harmonic profile, but the un-equal power distribution problem of LS-PWMs imposes limitation to their usage in high power and medium voltage applications. For achieving the equal conduction periods and to evenly distribute the power among different cells, carrier rotation should be employed in LS-PWM. This paper proposes a carrier rotation strategy introduced to LS-PWM for producing the collective benefit of equal power distribution from PS-PWM and better harmonic profile from LS-PWM. MATALB/Simulink has been used to create simulation models and the experimental validations are performed by a hardware setup using dSPACE-DS1104 R&D Controller board.

A single system can be deployed and can handle data coming from homes for an entire city. The implemented system includes web-dashboard and android application for monitoring the consumption.

Hence, this piece of research introduces a novel approach for classification of TCP techniques using fuzzy logic to support the efficient selection of test case prioritization techniques.

However, as per the Decision Maker (DM), a number of these solutions are unacceptable. In this paper, we propose two methods to obtain a subset of the Pareto front on the basis of the amount of loss a DM is ready to bear while compromising for a Pareto solution. For this, we introduce two different methods dBValue and dAValue to handle the scenario. A concept of Relenting Factor (R) is used to incorporate the compromise defined by DM. An elitist archive is implemented which is periodically filtered on the basis of dBValue or dAValue techniques to filter out best individuals for each generation. This semi-automatic filtering guides the search space towards Region Of Interest (ROI) with respect to the DM. The proposed method is evaluated on 3 objectives standard benchmark test problems.

This paper is introduction to a modified dynamic bus arbiter based on fuzzy logic for a system on chip design architecture. We are considering the worst case here that all masters are requesting for grant to access the bus, so arbiter need to manages the situation based on information about priority scheme, previously granted master and existing lottery arbitration scheme and fuzzy logic arbitration scheme. So we proposed a new two stage technique for granting the access of data bus by creating a subset of various master on the basis of their priority and using dynamic lottery scheme at first stage and fuzzy logic in the second stage in system. This is process by Acceptance rate calculator to decide which algorithm to resolve the grant issue. A hybrid arbiter which results in removing bus starvation and contention problem. This method is also address the pseudo random number is greater than the total partial sum in modified dynamic arbiter based on lottery manager so for this deciding factor is priority selection method and information about the previously granted master which also help to improve the latency.

This autonomous unmanned vehicle is considered to be navigating in an unknown environment comprising of numerous static objects. The system consists of two Mamdani-FIS controllers. The first controller is a Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) system which is used by the autonomous vehicle to avoid collision with an obstacle. The second controller is also a MISO system, which is a path planning fuzzy controller, and it is used to reach the destination. The three inputs to the first controller are left, right and front sensor inputs of the autonomous vehicle in order to detect the obstacles. There are two inputs to the second controller, first one determines the error between the desired orientation and the current orientation of the autonomous vehicle and second is the linear velocity of the autonomous vehicle. This linear velocity is predefined. The output of both the controllers are the angular velocities, which are added after being multiplied by predefined weights to give the final angular velocity of the vehicle. MATLAB software package was used for simulation experiments for three different scenarios namely; a cluttered obstacle environment, a long walled obstacle environment and random obstacle shapes environment in order to scrutinize the feasibility of the proposed FIS technique. The simulation results conveyed that FIS can perform the navigation and path planning tasks safely and efficiently in an environment with randomly distributed static objects. The results when compared with other approaches like neural-networks, ANFIS, Genetic algorithm and other techniques in terms of the computational time and ease of implementation were much more efficient found to be giving an error with acceptable tolerance. © 2017 IEEE.","autonomous navigation systems; Fuzzy Logic; obstacle avoidance; path planning; static environment","Angular velocity; Collision avoidance; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Controllers; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; MATLAB; Motion planning; Navigation systems; Unmanned vehicles; Vehicles; Velocity; Autonomous navigation systems; Autonomous unmanned vehicles; Fuzzy inference systems; MATLAB software package; Multiple input single output systems; Navigation and path planning; Randomly distributed; Static environment; Fuzzy inference",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

It is a single stage converter having the capability of boosting the input PV panel voltage and converting it to AC voltage to supply power to AC grid. The qZSI uses an effective control strategy of integrating the sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). This integrated hybrid HPWM technique is implemented in generating the control pulses for qZSI. In hardware, these control pulses are generated by using the pwm module of the MICROCHIP DSC. When the instantaneous AC grid voltage is less than the input PV panel voltage, the SPWM controls the single phase qZSI and when the input PV panel voltage is less than AC grid voltage, PAM works. The simulation results of the proposed scheme and the control pulses generated in hardware are shown in the paper. © 2017 IEEE.","hybrid pulse width modulation; Photovoltaic power system; pulse amplitude modulation; quasi-Z-source inverter; sinusoidal pulse width modulation; Z source inverter","Amplitude modulation; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Hardware; Modulation; Phase interfaces; Photovoltaic cells; Pulse width modulation; Voltage control; Hybrid pulse width modulation; Photovoltaic power systems; Photovoltaic systems; Pulse amplitude modulations (PAM); Pulse-width-modulated; Single stage converters; Sinusoidal pulse width modulation; Z-source inverter; Pulse amplitude modulation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

That is, a scheme is presented which dedicatedly maps the given function representation to the desired circuit in a one-to-one fashion - yielding significantly smaller circuit sizes. Experimental evaluations confirm that the proposed solution generates optical circuits with up to 97% less number of gates as compared to existing synthesis approaches. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Electric inverters; Timing circuits; Alternative synthesis; And-inverter graph (AIGs); Electronic systems; Experimental evaluation; Forward mapping; Function representations; Initial solution; Optical circuits; Computer aided design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10923152,9781538630938,DICDF,,"English","IEEE ACM Int.

Clinically, it was proved that there is a progressive decline in cognition, memory, and social functioning due to deposition of different types of protein in the brain. Traditional decision making systems are more manual in nature and ultimate conclusion in terms of exact prognosis is remote. Recently, under certain investigations neurological degradation occurs in the retina of the eye as well as the brain. Also it is clearly investigated that are some parameter changes on the retina of the eye of the AD patients. Therefore eye provides a transparent medium to neuropathology which initiated the development of ocular biomarkers for AD. Retinal imaging and visual testing potentially improves disease management and quality of life for AD patients as they are non invasive methods. Any disease modifying treatments which are developed are most possibly to be achieving success if initiated early in the process, and this needs that we tend to develop reliable, validated and economical ways to diagnose AD. Profiling of human body parameter using computers can be utilized for the early prognosis of AD. There are several imaging techniques used in clinical practice for the prognosis of Alzheimer's type pathology. In this paper we have focused on the fundus imaging, a type of retinal imaging that can be used for the early prognosis of AD.

But the grid continuously supplies the power even when load is not present. This cause harmful situation in and around the grid. In the proposed technique, First Zeta converter is designed using PID(Proportional Integral Differential) control technique for regulated DC output later the issue caused due to non-availability of load is solved by isolating the DC converter supplied to the inverter. The DC to DC converter is isolated using trip switch, so that power coming to load side is blocked as shown in figure 1. Here, DC-DC converter is designed to produce the regulated output also ability to handle the islanding problem. In order to monitor the converter, DC supply is fed to PWM(Pulse Width Modulation)inverter. These method is initially approached theoretically and further the condition tested and analyzed using simulation results. The PIDcontroller used in this paper is to provide optimum DC output during abnormal input and load condition. A novel digital logical control is designed near the load to isolate problems occurred due to islanding. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Distributed power generation; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Proportional control systems; Pulse width modulation; Two term control systems; Voltage control; Control techniques; DC-to-DC converters; Environmental pollutions; Fossil fuel energy; Grid connected systems; Logical control; PID-controllers; Proportional integral differentials; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033782,,,"English","Int.

In the proposed asymmetric multilevel inverter, dc sources are replaced with the switched capacitor unit, which in turn boosts the output voltage and produces twice the voltage levels at the loads.

To meet this requirement, the multilevel inverter concept has been introduced for medium voltage and high power applications. The multilevel inverter became popular because of its advantages like low harmonic distortion, less rate of change of voltage (dv/dt) and it reduces the bearings stress of a motor. There are different types of multilevel inverters have been introduced in to the market such as diode clamped, flying capacitor and cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter. Out of these, CHB inverter is extensively used with symmetrical and asymmetrical configuration. The major drawback of CHB inverter is, it requires more number of HBridges as the number of levels is increased. Therefore, switches requirement increases which lead to increase the size, cost and complexity. In this paper, a new topology for multilevel inverter is proposed with minimum number of switches in both symmetrical and asymmetrical configuration. The inverter is modeled using Matlab/Simulink software and the results are compared with cascaded H-Bridge inverter. The output of this inverter is fed to the 3 phase induction motor drive and the performance characteristics are also analyzed. © 2017 IEEE.","Asymmetrical; Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter; Induction motor; Multilevel inverter (MLI); Symmetrical","Bridge circuits; Electric drives; Induction motors; MATLAB; Asymmetrical; Cascaded H bridge (CHB); Cascaded H-bridge inverters; Multi Level Inverter (MLI); Performance characteristics; Power electronic converters; Rate of change of voltages; Symmetrical; Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062669,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Four tools that expose traces of semantic manipulation based on specific statistical cues are designed that work cohesively to allow detection of forgeries in single image (copy-move), composite image (splicing) and two generic artefacts (double JPEG compression and noise inconsistency). The measurement level fusion of tool outcome is carried out with Sugneo and Choquet integrals as the underlying aggregation operators. The classification competency of each tool is evaluated on a specialized dataset of forged images with the respective forgery trace. The empirical evaluation of the fusion framework for blind tamper detection is carried out on a combined master dataset comprising the various forgery traces under study.

Electrical distribution agency insists high power factor operation and it gives incentives on operating a system closer to unity. This paper presents a novel reactive power compensation using IM driven by nine switch ac-dc-Ac converter for a high power factor operation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The nine switch converter (NSC) with leading power factor operation delivers reactive power to the PCC. Thus, reactive power required for another load at PCC is compensated. Modified sinusoidal pulse width modulation is developed for NSC to operate the active front end rectifier and an inverter simultaneously to feed three-phase IM. A closed loop proportional integral control technique is developed to achieve desired VAR compensation. As per the required VAR compensation, front end rectifier voltage is modified. This is achieved by phase shifting of front end rectifier modulation reference by an angle δ with respect to utility phase voltage. The PCC phase voltage is continuously sensed to track instantaneous phase angle $\theta$ using synchronous reference frame phase lock loop. The analysis of VAR compensator is presented in the d-q reference frame. The proposed system is simulated in MATLAB for VAR compensation at PCC with 5.4 hp induction motor drive to test the performance of VAR control loop. To validate the feasibility of the proposed system an experimental prototype is developed with 1 hp induction motor drive. Gate pulses are generated using digital signal controller dsPIC33EP256MU810.

There is a high possibility that these existing methods will encounter more challenges and issues in relation to network dynamics, resulting in a high overhead in the network response time, leading to latency and traffic. In order to avoid these problems in the network and achieve an optimum level of resource utilization, a new paradigm called edge computing (EC) is proposed to pave the way for the evolution of new age applications and services. With the integration of EC, the processing capabilities are pushed to the edge of network devices such as smart phones, sensor nodes, wearables, and on-board units, where data analytics and knowledge generation are performed which removes the necessity for a centralized system. Many IoT applications, such as smart cities, the smart grid, smart traffic lights, and smart vehicles, are rapidly upgrading their applications with EC, significantly improving response time as well as conserving network resources. Irrespective of the fact that EC shifts the workload from a centralized cloud to the edge, the analogy between EC and the cloud pertaining to factors such as resource management and computation optimization are still open to research studies. Hence, this paper aims to validate the efficiency and resourcefulness of EC. We extensively survey the edge systems and present a comparative study of cloud computing systems. After analyzing the different network properties in the system, the results show that EC systems perform better than cloud computing systems.

The disruption of supply demands microgrid formation, where the objective is to maximize the restoration of critical loads. The complete restoration requires repair of damaged regions which brings the need for an efficient crew selection, repair time estimation, and crew dispatch. Ranking of load points and location are important considerations for strategic placement of distributed generation units. Prioritization of damaged regions is required for efficient crew dispatch. These ranking depends on multiple criteria based on subjective opinions of the experts. However, the existing methods fail to take account of the same.

This results in high energy dissipation of the devices. Thus, balancing of energy consumption is a major concern in such kind of network. Appropriate cluster head (CH) selection may provide to be an efficient way to reduce the energy dissipation and prolonging the network lifetime in WSN. This paper has adopted the concept of fuzzy if-then rules to choose the cluster head based on certain fuzzy descriptors. To optimise the fuzzy membership functions, particle swarm optimisation has been used to improve their ranges. Moreover, recent study has confirmed that the introduction of a mobile collector in a network which collects data through short-range communications also aids in high energy conservation. In this work, the network is divided into clusters and a mobile collector starts from the static sink or base station and moves through each of these clusters and collect data from the chosen cluster heads in a single-hop fashion. Mobility based on ant-colony optimisation has already proven to be an efficient method which is utilised in this work. Additionally, instead of performing clustering in every round, CH is selected on demand. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with some existing clustering algorithms.

Queries for such decision-making are exploratory, long and intricate in nature and involve the summarization and aggregation of data. Furthermore, the rapidly growing volume of data warehouses makes the response times of queries substantially large. The query response times need to be reduced in order to reduce delays in decision-making. Materializing an appropriate subset of views has been found to be an effective alternative for achieving acceptable response times for analytical queries. This problem, being an NP-Complete problem, can be addressed using swarm intelligence techniques. One such technique, i.e., the similarity interaction operator-based particle swarm optimization (SIPSO), has been used to address this problem. Accordingly, a SIPSO-based view selection algorithm (SIPSOVSA), which selects the Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice, has been proposed in this paper. Experimental comparison with the most fundamental view selection algorithm shows that the former is able to select relatively better quality Top-K views for materialization. As a result, the views selected using SIPSOVSA improve the performance of analytical queries that lead to greater efficiency in decision-making. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","analytical query performance; Data warehouse; quality view selection; similarity interaction operator-based particle swarm optimization; swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Decision making; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Analytical queries; Experimental comparison; High volumes; Historical data; Query response; Strategic decision making; Swarm intelligence techniques; View selection; Data warehouses","Vijay Kumar, T.V.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: tvvijaykumar@hotmail.com",,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Aerial nodes are extremely dynamic and provide a vast range of applications especially focusing on surveillance and data acquisition. However, these dynamic nodes are prone to unstable connectivity which hinders network operations, and also decreases the network lifetime. Such issues directly influence the control and relaying over aerial vehicles. Thus, it becomes essential to have an efficient strategy for controller selection and autonomous relaying. In this paper, a quaternion based neural model is proposed, which uses Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Technique (DEMATEL) for the selection of network controllers and relays. The proposed algorithms are capable of selecting controller with a complexity O(n), and provide cooperative relaying with a complexity O(n × k). The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by using simulations.

The data collected from the WSN is used for making decisions. The condition for making critical decision is to assure the trustworthiness of the data generated from sensor nodes. However, the approaches for scoring the sensed data alone is not enough in WSN since there is an interdependency between node and data item. If the overall trust score of the network is based on one trust component, then the network might be misguided. In this work, we propose the hybrid approach to address the issue by assigning the trust score to data items and sensor nodes based on data quality and communication trust respectively. The proposed hybrid trust management scheme (HTMS) detects the data fault with the help of temporal and spatial correlations. The correlation metric and provenance data are used to score the sensed data. The data trust score is utilized for making decision. The communication trust and provenance data are used to evaluate the trust score of intermediate nodes and source node. If the data item is reliable enough to make critical decisions, a reward is given by means of adding trust score to the intermediate nodes and source node. A punishment is given by reducing the trust score of the source and intermediate nodes, if the data item is not reliable enough to make critical decisions. Result shows that the proposed HTMS detects the malicious, faulty, selfish node and untrustworthy data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Data trustworthiness; Trust management; Wireless sensor networks","Decision making; Wireless sensor networks; Continuous observation; Data trustworthiness; Environmental conditions; Hybrid approach; Intermediate node; Making decision; Temporal and spatial correlation; Trust management; Sensor nodes","Karthik, N.; Department of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: nkarthikapce@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028564042

The selection of a particular methodology is heuristic and the performance of the system developed is unpredictable. The authors suggest that a designed process performance model (PPM) can help to predict the required factors of a process to help achieve set goals for the process. This, in turn, can help to control factors that the project and the organizations need to control and ensure expected results. PPMs may enable to work out the relationship between different variables for a well-defined project and this knowledge becomes basis for prediction of performance solution, and helps in implementation of solution. This approach related to designing of PPMs, for various real life projects situations has not been attempted by industry in a big way. The authors demonstrate how to work out the PPMs, based on the given inputs of projects, by an Indian IT company. The solution works out number of bids which arrive at a given time or predict when the next bid will arrive at service centre, based on time series and queuing theory approach. This solution approach is based on different problems that will become the basis to build PPMs for similar problems. The problems discussed here are from an Information Technology Company, with real life data from the projects under development. Testing these models with more projects data thus will formalize how to build PPMs in a similar way. The authors discuss problem areas where time series and queuing theory Models can be applied and benefits of the present approach. The authors have similarly worked on different mathematical models based on industry data and build PPMs based on Bayesian, regression, fuzzy logic and other models. This paper is submitted with only two models just to prove the concept. In future building PPMs is likely to be a necessity in high maturity IT organizations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","CMMI; FIFO; LIFO; OPP; Process performance model; QPM; Queuing theory; Time series analysis; Trend","Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Heuristic methods; Life cycle; Queueing theory; Software engineering; CMMI; FIFO; LIFO; Process performance; Queuing theory; Trend; Time series analysis","Sharma, B.; Birla Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: balwant.sharma@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029590007

To make clustering more efficient, fuzzy clusters can be used to ensure faster cluster formation and reliable data delivery. A wireless sensor network such as MANETs can then have an extended lifetime with the workload being distributed evenly. This paper proposes a competent fuzzy approach in cluster formation. The proposed approach has two significant stages, one which helps in the formation of fuzzy clusters and the other introduces a 3-level filtering technique. The former makes MANETs efficient and manageable and the latter helps in identifying trusted nodes for communication. The modified Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is entrusted with the task of assigning membership to each and every data point linked to each singular cluster center used in the formation of clusters, while a special filter scheme is used to distinguish between the trusted nodes and the malicious nodes. This helps is determining the identity and authenticity of the cluster members’. Eventually only the trusted nodes will be part of the communication range. The filter based fuzzy clustering approach can be used to determine the perfect nodes, which will reflect in the network performance. This also helps in improving the packet transmission in ad hoc networks like MANETs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","3-Tier fuzzy cluster (3TFC); Centralized 3-tier filter; Clustered enhanced adaptive acknowledgment (CEAACK); Fuzzy logic; Mobile ad hoc network","Ad hoc networks; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; 3-Tier fuzzy cluster (3TFC); Centralized 3-tier filter; Clustered enhanced adaptive acknowledgment (CEAACK); Clustering approach; Fuzzy C means clustering; Packet transmissions; Reliable data delivery; Reliable data transmission; Mobile ad hoc networks","Sathiamoorthy, J.; Thiruthangal Nadar CollegeIndia; email: Jsathyam74@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027493848

The efficiency of power conversion can be improved by reducing the number of stages. In this paper, a single stage boost inverter topology fed from PV array is used and connected to a single phase grid. Less number of switching components is used in this topology compared to conventional technique and hence, the converter losses are reduced. This can also be very well extended to utility grid system. Further, the proposed topology includes battery backup unit which consists of a DC-DC converter to overcome the variations of Voltage based Maximum Power Point (VMPP) of PV array because of the variations in solar irradiance. The proposed system uses the current control approach which has zero steady state tracking error to control the single stage boost inverter. The proposed system offers many advantages such as low cost, high efficiency, compactness and high quality of output power.

In this research work, the severity of cracks in the supporting column is assessed using a new technique. This piece of research study uses the soft computing method of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to model the domain experts’ knowledge and the knowledge assimilated through relevant literature to grade the severity of cracks in supporting column. The FCM grading model is further improved by using the Hebbian learning algorithms. The presented work demonstrates the classification and prediction capabilities of FCM for the respective structural health monitoring application, using two well-known and efficient FCM learning approaches viz. nonlinear Hebbian learning (NHL) and data-driven nonlinear Hebbian learning (DD-NHL). The proposed crack severity grading model classifies the cracks in supporting column into three categories, namely fine crack, moderate crack and severe crack. The proposed model uses DD-NHL algorithm. DD-NHL is trained with 70 records and tested with 30 records and gives an overall classification accuracy of 96 %. The obtained results are better compared to other popular machine learning-based classifiers. The proposed method helps even the non-experts to find the possible causes of crack and reports them to structural engineers, to start maintenance in an appropriate stage, using various crack control techniques. Also, a software tool for crack categorization was developed based on the FCM method and its learning capabilities. Thus, it is easier for the users/civil engineers to use this software to make decisions in civil engineering domain and improve their knowledge about the health of the structure. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Crack categorization; Data-driven nonlinear Hebbian learning; Fuzzy cognitive map; Fuzzy logic; Hebbian learning; Structural health monitoring","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Computation theory; Damage detection; Engineering research; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Grading; Large scale systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Reinforced concrete; Soft computing; Structural health monitoring; Classification accuracy; Fuzzy cognitive map; Hebbian learning; Hebbian learning algorithm; Learning capabilities; Prediction capability; Soft computing methods; Structural engineer; Cracks","Senniappan, V.; Department of Information Technology, Park College of Engineering and Technology, Kaniyur, India; email: vijipark99@gmail.com",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

The need of conducting uncertainty analysis in software reliability for the large and complex system is demanding. For large complex systems made up of many components, the uncertainty of each individual parameter amplifies the uncertainty of the total system reliability. In this paper, to overcome with the problem of uncertainty in software development process and environment, a neuro-fuzzy modeling has been proposed for software fault prediction. The training of the proposed neuro-fuzzy model has been done with genetic algorithm and back-propagation learning algorithm.

The power and energy consumption of the HPC system is the identified concerns in the realization of the next generation supercomputers. Achieving Exaflop performance within the 20-megawatt of targeted power consumption is a very daunting task. The effective and intelligent power management is the key to achieving energy efficiency. In order to address the power consumption concerns, there is a need for an effective power management framework, which can manage and optimize power consumption of the nodes in an adaptive and intelligent manner. The fine-grained power measurement, workload characterization, and autonomous decision-making capabilities are the keys to an effective power management. This paper presents a self-adaptive power management framework for HPC systems. The devised framework is based on software-based power measurement methodologies, Application-aware power profiling, and energyefficient rescheduling of the workloads for the energy optimization.

The common origin of traffic accidents is driver error. This is not going to change anytime soon thanks to the immense number of cell-phone users, in-car entertainment audio and video systems, and finally abundant traffic. There's one death every four minutes due to road accident in India. Such severe situation asks for a better scope that can propitiate the burden on the human drivers in certain critical instants. This demands a computationally efficient and fast responsive decision-making methods. But the course of autonomous vehicles is still in its early stages with companies still booming to build a fully autonomous vehicle. Volvo, Google, Tesla, BMW and more are still in the autonomous car research area. The mechanization and industrial science related to this field will mature over time, it is only a matter of time where the capability of driverless cars will outpace the outlook of any vehicle in the city.

The selected cluster head among the nodes is based on the quality of service parameter of the nodes. The weight assigned to the cluster head will determine how long the cluster head will hold. The fuzzy hierarchical ant colony optimization routing is used to select the optimized cluster head by way of in a cluster and the optimal cluster head will increase the routing. Ant colony optimization, Fuzzy Rules for Cluster Head Selection Process and Cluster’s Gateway are the three processes involved in the proposed FHACO protocol. The parameters taken for our proposed algorithm are the buffer size, energy consumption, routing overhead, packet delivery ratio and end to end delay throughput of wireless system.

The high dimensional data sets generally comprise of irrelevant and redundant features also along with the relevant features which deteriorate the clustering result. Therefore, feature selection is necessary to select a subset of relevant features as it improves discrimination ability of the original set of features which helps in improving the clustering result. Though many metaheuristics have been suggested to select subset of the relevant features in wrapper framework based on some criteria, most of them are marred by the three key issues. First, they require objects class information a priori which is unknown in unsupervised feature selection. Second, feature subset selection is devised on a single validity measure; hence, it produces a single best solution biased toward the cardinality of the feature subset. Third, they find difficulty in avoiding local optima owing to lack of balancing in exploration and exploitation in the feature search space. To deal with the first issue, we use unsupervised feature selection method where no class information is required. To address the second issue, we follow pareto-based approach to obtain diverse trade-off solutions by optimizing conceptually contradicting validity measures silhouette index (Sil) and feature cardinality (d). For the third issue, we introduce genetic crossover operator to improve diversity in a recent Newtonian law of gravity-based metaheuristic binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in multi-objective optimization scenario; it is named as improved multi-objective BGSA for feature selection (IMBGSAFS). We use ten real-world data sets for comparison of the IMBGSAFS results with three multi-objective methods MBGSA, MOPSO, and NSGA-II in wrapper framework and the Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (FM-CC) as a multi-objective filter method. We employ four multi-objective quality measures convergence, diversity, coverage and ONVG. The obtained results show superiority of the IMBGSAFS over its competitors. An external clustering validity index F-measure also establish the above finding. As the decision maker picks only a single solution from the set of trade-off solutions, we employee the F-measure to select a final single solution from the external archive. The quality of final solution achieved by IMBGSAFS is superior over competitors in terms of clustering accuracy and/or smaller subset size. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature","Data clustering; Feature selection; Gravitational search algorithm; Multi-objective optimization","Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Set theory; Clustering validity index; Data clustering; Exploration and exploitation; Feature subset selection; Gravitational search algorithms; Linear correlation coefficient; Unsupervised classification; Unsupervised feature selection; Feature extraction","Prakash, J.; Computational Intelligence and Data Mining Research Laboratory, ABV - Indian Institute of Information technology and Management GwaliorIndia; email: jayprakash.iiitm@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035104565

The conventional first order sliding mode controller regulates the output voltage to the desired value but is effected by chattering. Chattering can be reduced by generating continuous version of the discontinuous control signal in the boundary layer sliding mode controller but this method may cause steady state error. Without affecting the system performance chattering can be reduced by using second order sliding mode controller. In this paper, Super-Twisting Algorithm is used for the implementation of second order sliding mode controller. Generated continuous control signals are compared with a repetitive sequence to obtain constant frequency switching signals for the buck converter.

For a low voltage MG, the line impedance between the distributed generator (DG) units are predominantly resistive, therefore the existing droop control approach i.e. P - w and Q - v droop yields transients and poor stability. In view of improving the transient response and stability, a new resistive droop control approach is proposed this paper. Here, the considered MG test system is a low voltage MG that operates in islanded mode. Three control loops namely power, voltage and current control of a DG are analyzed under a special case of resistive low voltage MG. The proposed control scheme is implemented locally at each DG terminal. Besides this, secondary distributed cooperative control is used to regulate the voltage and frequency deviations caused by the primary droop control. The effectiveness of the proposed voltage and frequency synchronization scheme is verified by creating a simulation setup considering a 4-bus MG test system using MATLAB/Simulink. The results obtained envisage that the proposed scheme is restoring the voltage and frequency in a short time duration. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed control; Distributed generation; Droop control; Microgrid; Secondary cooperative control","Distributed parameter control systems; Distributed power generation; Electric inverters; Embedded systems; MATLAB; Multi agent systems; Power control; Synchronization; Transient analysis; Co-operative control; Distributed control; Distributed control strategy; Distributed generators; Droop control; Frequency synchronization; Micro grid; Voltage and current controls; Electric machine control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509044269,,,"English","Int.

The restoration plans have changed over the years to cope up with this changing nature of power system. A vast change is observed in methods, strategies used for service restoration. In this paper, review of different methods which are proposed to solve service restoration problem is presented which includes knowledge based systems, expert systems, heuristic methods, artificial intelligence techniques with search algorithm, hybrid methods like combining fuzzy logic method with Genetic Algorithm (GA), expert system and coloured petri nets etc., and different guidelines formed. © 2017 IEEE.","distributed generation; distribution automation; meta-heuristic algorithm; optimization; servicerestoration","Distributed power generation; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Knowledge based systems; Optimization; Petri nets; Restoration; Artificial intelligence techniques; Coloured Petri Nets; Distribution automation; Distribution systems; Fuzzy logic method; Meta heuristic algorithm; Monitoring and control; servicerestoration; Heuristic methods",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

Instead of all nodes participating in the sensing process, a better approach is data aggregation with clustering as its direct application. Selection of cluster representatives/heads is a crucial task mainly because the performance of any clustering protocol mainly depends on this criterion. Recently, a fuzzy logic based selection criterion was proposed. However, the round-by-round approach of the authors added to the complexity in the network in terms of the number of messages exchanged between the nodes per round.

The drive has been controlled by Direct Torque Controlled Carrier Based Space Vector Pulse width Modulation (DTCCBSVPWM). DTC is a precise controller for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) owing to its robust and fast torque response for steady-state as well as transient conditions. The basic drawback of DTC is due to high ripple content in stator current, and torque due to the application of same active voltage vector during the entire sample period. It is resolved by using an appropriate modulation technique. Space Vector Modulation (SVM) synthesis the voltage vector gives superior performance, but calculation of angle and sector is complex. A simplified version, unified voltage modulation or carrier based space vector pulse width modulation is described. The voltage modulation task is simplified by synthesizing inverter output voltage directly with the effective times.

While designing power modulators for DC storage system, efficiency is a major concern. This work is dedicated to increase the efficiency of power modulators used for DC storage in microgrid [4]. In the battery system, a bidirectional converter is needed to facilitate bidirectional power flow.

They produce an optimal or near optimal solution with reduced computational complexity and are thus are considered where deterministic algorithms produce inefficient solutions. Robotics has been a disciplinary field where artificial intelligence is bestowed to robots for them to perform complex tasks similar to human beings. Many of tasks involve decision making removing the need for a human intervener. Robots can efficiently perform their tasks on the ground, air as well as underwater missions. To do so, a very important property required by the robot is to efficiently calculate its path in its surroundings. The path planning problem is a hard problem to solve using deterministic techniques and thus many heuristics based techniques are employed to solve this novel problem. This paper will review some the recent advancements in the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles using meta-heuristic techniques. An extensive survey of the related research is presented with a stress on the major novelties of their work.

On the other hand Selective Harmonic Elimination with Pulse Width Modulation (SHE-PWM) offers a fine control of the harmonic spectrum of a given voltage and/or current waveforms generated by a DC to AC converter (inverter). Inverters with this technique operate with low switching frequencies and due to capability of elimination of lower order harmonics, SHE-PWM is highly advantageous for high power inverters over other techniques that reduces the harmonics as a whole and generate high-quality output which in turn results in minimum current ripple, reduced torque pulsations, improved overall performance by increasing the life and efficiency of the electrical appliances. Over the last few years, the SHE-PWM technique is extended from low level inverters to multilevel inverters.

The constant speed of operation with minimum torque ripples and unity power factor operation during transient state is the most difficult control part in the motor drive system. At the starting condition, the current is too high due to the absence of back EMF. Therefore the motor will start with high torque ripples. In order to eliminate the torque ripples during starting condition by limiting the starting current of the motor with properly designed Canonical Switching Cell (CSC) converter and an intelligent controller, which will improve the power factor of the supply system and reliability of the PMBLDC motor.

These bearings eliminate the requirement of an axial AMB which results in reduction of cost and required mounting space. The presented controller is designed with the aim to reduce the requirement of exact system modelling. Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) satisfies this requirement since it can be designed by the knowledge of system behaviour or performance. However, the determination of different parameters of FLC is based on the designer knowledge and experience about the operational characteristics of the system. In the present work, efforts are made to enhance the system performance by designing the Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC) with uncertain bound algorithm.

These processes improve the decision making during decease identification. Image classification is usually done by checking image visual or semantic content similarity. Image content may be represented by its low level visual features referring to mathematical attributes or high level description based semantic attributes. Image similarity is verified by using similarity or dissimilarity measures or distance metrics. As image attributes are wide in range, the similarity measure that worked well for one particular feature set may not show the similar performance for the other. Based on it this paper explored geometrical, statistical and cumulative dissimilarity measures viz. Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Cosine, Chi-square, Kullback, Jeffrey, Kolmogorov, Earthmover's and Cramer distances and compared their effect in similar looking image retrieval process. Experiments were done on these distance metrics with respect to appearance based features, intensity features, texture features and shape features. Through the experimentation, certain conclusions were drawn on the performance of these distance metrics with different feature sets in classification and retrieval. Comparative analysis performed on IRMA CLEFmed 2007 and 2008 image data sets.

The air Pollution can be minimized by the use of the renewable energy sources and the advanced electric motors for the transportation instead of combustion engine. The Battery Operated Electric Vehicles, solar powered Electric vehicles, hybrid Electric Vehicles and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles are the best alternatives for the conventional vehicles. The performance of the Electric Vehicle is determined by the traction motor which drives the wheels of the Vehicle. Here an Axial Flux Permanent Magnet motor with Zeta Converter is proposed to control the speed of the electric vehicle. While using solar power for the electric vehicle, the input voltage given to the system is not maintained at the same level which will vary the speed of the motor. So the speed can be maintained constant using the proposed zeta converter along with the Axial Flux Brushless Permanent Magnet DC Motor in closed loop condition. The Zeta converter along with Voltage source Inverter plays an very important role in motor based applications. The zeta converter can able to increase the voltage level or decrease the voltage level and maintain the constant voltage level using PI controller.

A neutrosophic cubic set has the capacity to express the hybrid information of both the interval neutrosophic set and the single valued neutrosophic set simultaneously. As newly defined, little research on the operations and applications of neutrosophic cubic sets has been reported in the current literature. In the present paper, we propose the score and accuracy functions for neutrosophic cubic sets and prove their basic properties. We also develop a strategy for ranking of neutrosophic cubic numbers based on the score and accuracy functions. We firstly develop a TODIM (Tomada de decisao interativa e multicritévio) in the neutrosophic cubic set (NC) environment, which we call the NC-TODIM. We establish a new NC-TODIM strategy for solving multi attribute group decision making (MAGDM) in neutrosophic cubic set environment.

The voltage source converters (VSCs) associated with the distributed generation (DG) units and a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) together form an effective microgrid PQ conditioner. The dc-link voltage of the DSTATCOM is controlled using the proposed AFPI controller to improve the dynamic performance of the system during system uncertainties. Unlike the conventional PI controller, in the proposed controller the gains are no longer fixed. It is dynamically adjusted by the fuzzy logic-based intelligent supervisory control system according to system operating conditions. Thus, the intelligent supervisory control system forces the controller to work in a linear region for a wide range of operating conditions and improves the dynamic performance. Simultaneously, the microgrid PQ conditioner effectively compensates the current-based PQ problems and keeps the grid current balanced and sinusoidal with low total harmonic distortion under all conditions.","Adaptive Fuzzy Pi Controller; Dstatcom; Microgrid; Photovoltaic System; Solid Oxide Fuel Cell","Adaptive control systems; Control systems; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent control; Mechanisms; Photovoltaic cells; Power quality; Process control; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Static synchronous compensators; Two term control systems; Water craft; Adaptive fuzzy; Distributed generation units; Distribution static compensator; DSTATCOM; Intelligent supervisory control; Micro grid; Photovoltaic systems; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Controllers",,,"Acta Press",14801752,,CISSF,,"English","Control Intell Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035130950

Nonetheless, how to handle several dynamically varying security services with the mobile user's requirements efficiently is a critical problem that hinders the development of FMEC. To address this problem, we sought to introduce an approach to selecting an appropriate security service as per the mobile user requirements in FMEC. The problem of appropriate security service selection with hesitant fuzzy information is a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper, we introduce a soft hesitant fuzzy rough set (SHFRS) to solve multi-criteria decision making problems. SHFRS is introduced as an innovative extension of the hesitant fuzzy rough set theory by fusing it with the hesitant fuzzy soft set. We describe the inverse hesitant fuzzy soft set that defines the inverse hesitant fuzzy relation to determine the SHFRS upper and lower approximation operators of any hesitant fuzzy subset in the given set of parameters. We also present different special cases of SHFRS upper and lower approximation operators and discuss some fundamental theorems based on approximation operators. In addition, we propose a novel solution to multi-criteria decision making problems based on SHFRS.

Automatic Query Expansion (AQE) is one of the approaches to enhance IR performance by adding additional terms to original query. The selection of suitable additional terms for AQE is a crucial task. Term weighting method is one of the ways to deal with such a problem. This paper presents a new term weighting based AQE approach to retrieve more relevant documents from data corpus. The proposed approach comprises of three major steps. First step determines the optimal weights of different IR evidences for different terms using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Fuzzy logic technique is used to improve performance of PSO by controlling inertia and acceleration coefficients during the optimization. Co-occurrence score is introduced as new IR evidence in the proposed approach. Second step is focused on removal of noisy terms by using new combined semantic filtering method. Third step reweights the terms using Rocchio method. The proposed approach is compared with recently developed automatic query expansion approaches in terms of performance measures such as precision, recall, F-measure and MAP (Mean Average Precision). Three benchmark datasets CACM, CISI and TREC-3 are used to verify the results.

The inherent closed-loop responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications make them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) hosted in cloud data centers are becoming the vital engine for real-time data processing and analytics in any IoT software architecture. But the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT applications and data streams. Here, we propose RIoTBench, a real-time IoT benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as modular microbenchmarks. Further, we define four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks based on common patterns of data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and predictive analytics that are intrinsic to the closed-loop IoT decision-making life cycle. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and smart health, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10 000 messages/second from up to 3 million sensors. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public cloud and present empirical observations. This suite can be used by DSPS researchers for performance analysis and resource scheduling, by IoT practitioners to evaluate DSPS platforms, and even reused within IoT solutions.

Priority-based decoupled approach is one of the several approaches to solve a MAPP problem. It works as follows: first, find paths of individual agents and then restructure these paths based on some priority of the agents. Most of the existing decoupled approaches use centralised algorithms. However, multi-agent systems are inherently distributed, where agents have limited information and each agent may not know the total number of agents in the system. Some of these aspects are incorporated in DMAPP. DMAPP is an existing fully distributed algorithm that works in three phases: (i) individual path planning, (ii) priority decision-making and (iii) plan restructuring. However, DMAPP is incomplete, i.e. DMAPP may fail to find a solution, even if it exists. In this paper, we present a new distributed algorithm (DiMPP) which is complete. The computer simulations performed on some well-known benchmark domains reveal that DiMPP outperforms DMAPP in the number of problem instances solved. For larger problem instances, the time taken by DiMPP is orders of magnitude less than that of some existing centralised algorithms. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decoupled approach; Multi-agent path planning; plan restructuring; prioritised path planning","Decision making; Motion planning; Problem solving; Benchmark domains; decoupled approach; Individual paths; Limited information; Multi agent; Orders of magnitude; plan restructuring; Problem instances; Multi agent systems","Chouhan, S.S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology RoorkeeIndia; email: satycdec@iitr.ac.in",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",0952813X,,,,"English","J.

In a space-vector PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) inverter, which is widely used, the voltage utilization factor can be increased to 0.906, normalized to that of the six step operation. Three phase voltage-source pulse width modulation inverters have been widely used for dc/ac power conversion since they can produce a variable voltage and variable frequency power. However, they require a dead time to avoid the arm-short and snubber circuits to suppress the switching spike. Apart from these ancillary aspects, the PWM inverters have an essential problem that they cannot produce voltages as large as the six-step inverters can. That is, the dc bus voltage cannot be utilized to the maximum. To increase the voltage utilization of the sinusoidal PWM inverter, a method of the addition of the third harmonics to the reference voltage was proposed by which the fundamental component can be increased by 15.5%. In a space-vector PWM inverter, which is widely used, the voltage utilization factor can be increased to 0.906, normalized to that of the sixstep operation. On the other hand, different discontinuous PWM strategies were analyzed, where the modulation waveform of a phase has at least one segment of 60 which is clamped to the positive and/or negative dc bus for, at most, a total of 120 in a fundamental period during which no switching in either inverter arm occurs. Recently, it is shown that discontinuous PWM schemes and the space-vector PWM can be obtained by properly adding a zero-sequence voltage to the original modulation waveform. © 2017 IEEE.","Pulse Width Modulation; Space Vector; Total Harmonic Distortion","Electric drives; Health care; Modulation; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Vectors; Voltage control; DC/AC power conversion; Fundamental component; Modulation waveforms; Space Vector; Three phase voltage; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Variable frequencies; Zero sequence voltage; Electric inverters",,"Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057788,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The procedure may last for a longer period and the patient should be in anesthetize condition during the whole operation. A complete dosage of anesthesia cannot be given at a single stroke. This may lead to severity in patients. The objective is to maintain the hypnosis level of the patient in a proper and safe value. The traditional BIS method does not provide accurate results and the control was less than optimal. A more efficient estimate of the anesthetic level can be made if the measurements of heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure and body temperatures are available. To provide accurate predictions, an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms is included. Thus, the infusion of the drug is adapted to the real needs of the patient and, consequently, the performance is improved compared to other approaches. The evaluation of controller was done in simulation. The proposed model predictive controller based on an adaptive fuzzy model makes accurate controlling of the level of anesthesia in patients with dynamics inherent of the anesthetic process. The interpatient variability and intrapatient variability are also handled effectively.

As a result of wide-range availability of cloud services with similar functionalities, it is very crucial to determine which service best addresses the user’s desires and objectives. This paper aims to design a new cloud service selection model under the fuzzy environment by utilizing the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The AHP method is enforced to configure the structure of cloud service selection problem and to impel the criteria weight using the pairwise comparisons, and the TOPSIS method utilizes the final ranking of the solution. In our proposed model, the non-functional quality of service requirements is taken into consideration for selecting appropriate service. Furthermore, the proposed model exploits a set of pre-defined linguistic variables, parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers for evaluating each criteria weights. The experimental results obtained using the real-time cloud service domains prove the efficacy of our proposed model and demonstrate the effectiveness by inducing better performance, when compared against other available cloud service selection algorithms.

The proposed sliding mode control approach is robust against unknown disturbances, parametric variations and uncertainties in the system and peak overshoot dc-link voltage is reduced. Furthermore, it produces no chattering, reduces the settling time and Total harmonic distortion. © 2017 IEEE.","DC-link voltage; Fuzzy logic controller; harmonic reduction; second-order sliding mode control; wind energy conversion system","Energy conversion; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Health care; Nonlinear control systems; Wind power; DC-link voltages; Fuzzy logic controllers; Harmonic reduction; Second-order sliding-mode control; Wind energy conversion system; Sliding mode control",,"Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057788,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The first stage consisting of energy detection is followed by fuzzy logic based detector employing dynamic thresholds for final decision making of the spectrum sensing. Two metrics—Credibility_energy and Credibility_psd as inputs to the fuzzy logic detector are introduced. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme improves detection performance significantly as compared to existing two stage schemes at local node. The approach does not require a priori knowledge about the format of primary user signal retaining its practical implementation simple. We further investigate cooperative sensing with the proposed scheme to show that it outperforms the conventional cooperative spectrum sensing. An analytical expression for optimal number of CR users for cooperative spectrum sensing is also derived. This yields enhanced local sensing performance with reduced communication overheads. Having determined the optimal number of users, for cooperative spectrum sensing, the probability of error defined as the sum of probability of miss detection and probability of false is also minimized. Numerical results show that more enhanced local sensing performance reduces the number of optimal users for cooperation up to a significant extent at low SNR. Owing to the advantages of easy implementation, low cost and smaller overheads, the proposed solution offers a potential spectrum detection technique for cognitive radio systems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cooperative spectrum sensing; Fuzzy logic; Spectrum sensing techniques; Two stage detector","Cognitive systems; Computer circuits; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Probability; Radio systems; Analytical expressions; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio network; Communication overheads; Cooperative sensing; Detection performance; Probability of errors; Spectrum sensing techniques; Cognitive radio","Kaur, G.; Gautam Buddha UniversityIndia; email: gurjeet_kaur@rediffmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020122851

In the growing demand of electrical power, alternate resources such as renewable source are inevitable. Renewable source power plants such as solar power plants (microgrid) (Photovoltaic cells) operate in both off grid and on grid modes. Grid Synchronisation (GS) is a necessary operation to connect the renewable source to the micro grid. Communication between the controllers on both the side using Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is proposed in this project. CAN protocol is chosen over Ethernet and GPS assisted GS since Ethernet has transmission delays and GPS assisted GS is costlier. CAN is an efficient and low cost protocol which helps in reducing the synchronisation time. Whenever the renewable source has to connected to the grid, the required information is shared among the main and local controllers via CAN. The voltage templates from the grid are obtained and transmitted through CAN to the local controller. To match the parameters such as voltage amplitude and frequency, a Voltage Source Inverter is used which is connected with the local controller. Whenever there is switching to on-grid mode, VSI produces the required controlled output. A DC-AC converter circuit is added to get an AC output from the PV cells. The proposed technique thus provides faster and transient less transition between modes. © 2017 IEEE.","Controller Area Network; Grid Synchronisation; microgrid; renewable energy sources; synchronisation time; transients","Control system synthesis; Controllers; Electric inverters; Energy policy; Ethernet; Health care; Natural resources; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Process control; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Synchronization; Transients; Controller area network; Local controllers; Low-cost protocol; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Renewable sources; Transmission delays; Voltage source inverter; Electric power transmission networks",,"Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057788,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The approach uses auctioning mechanism to decide on the infrastructure provider to serve the virtual network requests, sent by the service providers. A request can be mapped either by a single infrastructure provider or cooperatively by multiple infrastructure providers, depending on the requirements of the service provider’s request and the network resources available with the infrastructure provider. The infrastructure provider that matches best the demands of the service provider is chosen by the system.

On the other hand multi-hop communication significantly reduces the energy required for communication and multi-path communication helps in distributing the relay load and it also increases reliability of the network. The proposed methodology in this paper is a combination of these three features. In addition to that, we have used fuzzy logic in cluster head (CH) selection to blend different parameters to select the set of best possible CHs and to handle the uncertainties in parametric quantities. There are five main aspects of the proposed algorithm (a) on demand based clustering (b) fuzzy logic based CH selection (c) dynamic unequal cluster range for CHs’ (d) a cost function based multi-hop relay selections (e) Fibonacci sequence based relay load distribution. The proposed approach creates more balanced cluster by means of fuzzy logic and inequality in cluster range. It saves energy by conducting CH selection on demand basis. Finally, the cost function based multi-hop relay selections along with Fibonacci sequence based relay load distribution create an optimal structure for relaying data.The proposed approach is implemented and compared with the well known approaches like LEACH, ECPF, CHEF and UCR.

The epsilon-deviation degree method and other ranking methods are available in the literature and applied in the field of decision-making. Despite of the merits, some limitations and shortcomings are observed in these methods. Namely, (1) these methods cannot distinguish fuzzy numbers sharing the same support and different cores, (2) these methods cannot distinguish crisp-valued fuzzy numbers with different heights, (3) these methods also cannot make a preference between a crisp-valued fuzzy number and an arbitrary fuzzy number, (4) if the expectation values of the centroid points are the same for the fuzzy numbers to be compared, then these methods give an incorrect ranking, (5) if fuzzy numbers depict compensation of areas, then these methods fail to give a proper ranking, and (6) further inconsistency in ranking the fuzzy numbers and their images is also observed. Hence, a modified epsilon-deviation degree method is developed, based on the concept of the ill-defined magnitude ‘value’ and the angle of the fuzzy set. The proposed method bears all the properties of epsilon-deviation degree method and overcome all the limitations and shortcomings of this method and other existing methods. Various sets of fuzzy numbers are considered for comparative study between the existing ranking methods and the proposed method for validation. Further, the proposed method seems to outperform in all situations. Risk analysis problem under uncertain environment are often studied under fuzzy domain. Hence, a study is done by applying the proposed method to risk analysis in poultry farming. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Angle of fuzzy set; Ranking fuzzy numbers; Value","Decision making; Fuzzy rules; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Analysis problems; Comparative studies; Different heights; Expectation values; Ranking fuzzy numbers; Ranking of fuzzy numbers; Uncertain environments; Value; Fuzzy sets",,,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

In the big data era, we are facing a diversity of datasets from different sources in different domains. These datasets consist of multiple modalities, each of which has a different representation, distribution, scale and density. Big data have volumes in range Exabyte's ten to the power of eighteen. A large number of data's are stored in Big Data storage every second. For instance in YouTube for every second a video of size 72 hours are being uploaded. It shows that big data have a big scope in handling of large data. Big data for learning, intelligence, data fusion, social network, mining and so many plays a vital role in it. The big data technologies along with machine learning algorithm have developed lots of advanced development in the field of social mining, network and social Medias. It has also developed so many challenges in data storage, handling, representation, mining, analysing the user behaviours and so many. In Social mining along with text the symbols are also analysed for effective mining of users. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems. The data storage size can be optimized by using the map reduce algorithm in a effective way for data storage in big data. When the repeateddata's are replaced with its reference then the storage will be optimized. Thus this method implementation will leads to the effective data mining and the analysing of persons behaviour more effectively. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; Cognitive Radio; Data fusion; Decision Making; MapReduce; Social Mining","Behavioral research; Cognitive radio; Data fusion; Data handling; Data mining; Data storage equipment; Decision making; Digital storage; Health care; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Data technologies; Different domains; Map-reduce; Method implementations; Multiple modalities; Number of datum; Single domains; User behaviour; Big data",,"Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057788,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Although high-level behavioral models exist for modeling analog and mixed signal circuits, these comprise many complex differential equations which cannot be realized implicitly using Boolean logic (which is the basic functional block of an FPGA) on an FPGA. So, a more convenient way is explored to map analog circuits into digital domain by converting them into fixed-point architectures because of its advantage of manipulating data with lower word-length. To address the loss of accuracy due to finite word-length effects and limited reconfigurable resources, word-lengths are optimized under the constraint of given performance metrics. The proposed technique built in MATLAB/Simulink environment with Xilinx System Generator support is illustrated with the help of a case study of a peak-current-mode-controlled buck-type switching converter implemented on Xilinx Virtex™-5 FPGA. To illustrate the applicability of this environment for pre-silicon test development, well-accepted fault models are emulated with the help of non-ideal model of a buck converter. The emulation results are seen to be close to that of a post-fabricated power converter in the presence of faults. Experimental results show that FPGA resource utilization can be reduced significantly while achieving the desired performance accuracy under the constraint of multiple error metrics.

Firstly a traditional two-area non-reheat thermal system is considered, and gains of the fuzzy controller are tuned employing BFOA using integral of squared error objective function. The supremacy of this controller is demonstrated by juxtaposing the results with particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly algorithm (FA), BFOA, hybrid BFOA–PSO-based PI and fuzzy PI controllers based upon pattern search (PS) and PSO algorithms for the same power system structure. The approach is then extended to a two-area reheat system, and improved results are found with the purported FPI/FPID controller in comparison with PSO and artificial bee colony optimized PI controller. Further, the approach is implemented on a traditional multi-source multi-area (MSMA) hydrothermal system and its superb performance is observed over genetic algorithm and hybrid FA–PS tuned PI controller. Additionally, to demonstrate the scalability of the designed controller to cope with restructured power system, the study is also protracted to a restructured MSMA hydrothermal power system. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to ascertain the robustness of the controller designed for the systems under study. It is observed that the suggested FPI/FPID controller optimized for nominal conditions is able to handle generation rate constraints and wide variations in nominal loading condition as well as system parameters. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Automatic generation control (AGC); Fuzzy logic controller (FLC); Multi-area power system; Multi-source power system; PI/PID controller; Restructured power system","Controllers; Electric power systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensitivity analysis; Three term control systems; Traffic signals; Water craft; Automatic generation control; Fuzzy logic controllers; Multi area power systems; Multi-Sources; Restructured power systems; Electric power system control","Arya, Y.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Maharaja Surajmal Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: yarya@msit.in",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031774276

The major reason for adopting linguistic preference is to ease the process of rating of alternatives by allowing decision makers (DMs) to strongly emphasize their opinion on each alternative. In the first tier, aggregation is done using a newly proposed operator called linguistic based aggregation (LBA), which aggregates linguistic terms directly without making any conversion. The main motivation for this proposal is driven by the previous studies on aggregation theory which reveals that conversion leads to loss of information and formation of virtual sets which are no longer sensible and rational for decision making process. Secondly, in the next tier, a new ranking method called IFSP (intuitionistic fuzzy set based PROMETHEE) is proposed which is an extension to PROMETHEE (preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation) under intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) context. Unlike previous ranking methods, this ranking method follows a new formulation by considering personal choice of the DMs over each alternative. The main motivation for such formulation is derived from the notion of not just obtaining a suitable alternative but also coherently satisfying the DMs’ viewpoint during decision process. Finally, the practicality of the framework is tested by using supplier selection (SS) problem for an automobile factory. The strength and weakness of the proposed LBA-IFSP framework are verified by comparing with other methods under the realm of theoretical and numerical analysis. The results from the analysis infer that proposed LBA-IFSP framework is rationally coherent to DMs’ viewpoint, moderately consistent with other methods and highly stable and robust against rank reversal issue. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy set; Decision making; Linguistic based aggregation operator; PROMETHEE; Supplier selection","Decision making; Decision theory; Industrial plants; Linguistics; Mathematical operators; Motivation; Numerical methods; Aggregation operator; Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Decision making process; Decision-making frameworks; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Linguistic preferences; PROMETHEE; Supplier selection; Fuzzy sets","KS, R.; School of Computing, SASTRA UniversityIndia; email: ravichandran20962@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

The sales data of past 2.5 years from prominent retail stores across 45 different regions has been used to develop this study. A regression tree/random forest-based machine learning algorithm is used to predict weekly demand. It incorporates price, holidays, discounts, inventory and other regional factors in decision making. Following this, the demand-price interdependencies are quantified and integrated into an integer linear programming model for optimal price allocation. This methodology has been implemented on offline retailing of expensive products which generally follow high variation in demand.

The encryption method is designed where an encrypted pixel is generated based on the corresponding plaintext pixel together with the neighbouring encrypted pixels.

Elimination of look up tables is possible since boundary computation is performed online with estimated stator voltages calculated using current errors along the orthogonal axes thus making implementation easier.

Nowadays, it becomes very essential to stabilize the output voltage of DC/DC converter for hybrid energy application. To achieve this objective, control of duty ratios of switches using different control strategies is proposed in this paper. Comparative analysis has been carried out between two control strategies: PI control and Fuzzy Logic control. The presented dual input DC/DC converter is having high step up ratio (i.e. high voltage transfer gain), wider range of switching duty cycle and wide range of different input powers. This method of control is well suitable to use the converter in the integration of sources like solar PVs, wind, ultra-capacitors, etc. Finally, the transient as well as steady state analysis have been carried out for either of the control techniques using MATLAB SIMULINK platform.

Recently, the BLDC motor becomes most popular in industrial and residential applications due to its low cost, easy control techniques, low maintenance and constant torque. High switching losses are associated with the conventional BLDC motor because of six number of switches hence poor efficiency. FSTPI fed BLDC motor drive has high efficiency due to the low switching losses. The BLDC motor is found non-liner system due the saturation element. Integral part of PI or PID controller is used to reduce steady state error but integral part may saturate if large changes are made in set point which results in unwanted side effect known as windup phenomenon. Windup phenomenon causes large overshoot and settling time in torque-speed characteristic. A tracking anti windup (AWC) PI controller and hysterics current controller has been introduced for effective utilization of proposed system and to make system free from windup phenomenon. FSTPI fed BLDC motor drive system with tracking anti windup PI controller and hysterics current controller is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink software.

Selection of high-performance diodes for such high-frequency rectification is challenging as a trade-off is often required among numerous conflicting parameters. Three high performance diodes, namely, an ultra-fast silicon diode, a super barrier diode and a silicon carbide Schottky diode, are compared experimentally for their relative performances for high frequency rectification. The experimental cases include rectification of sinusoidal, square and quasi-square wave alternating waveforms as these are commonly encountered in compact power supplies. At first, the diodes are compared for their forward voltage drops and their reverse recovery times with low-amplitude, high-frequency alternating waveforms generated using a waveform generator. Later the diodes are tested with sinusoidal excitation of much higher amplitude, generated using a power amplifier and the above said waveform generator. It is seen that the results of the comparative study at lower amplitude hold good at higher amplitude as well. A unique experimental condition is applied for enhancing and estimating the case-to-ambient thermal resistance of the diode under study. Later, from the practically obtained thermal resistance and the measured temperature rise of each of the diode, the power loss incurred in each diode is obtained. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the SiC diode, though having the highest forward voltage drop, has the lowest temperature rise and power dissipation on account of superior reverse recovery characteristics. © 2017 IEEE.","high frequency diodes; high-frequency rectification; junction capacitance; reverse recovery characteristics; thermal imaging","Capacitance; DC-DC converters; Economic and social effects; Electric generators; Electric inverters; Electric rectifiers; Food products; Infrared imaging; Power amplifiers; Recovery; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconductor diodes; Signal processing; Silicon carbide; Silicon compounds; Silicon on insulator technology; Voltage control; Experimental conditions; Experimental investigations; High frequency diode; High frequency HF; Junction capacitances; Reverse-recovery characteristics; Silicon carbide schottky diodes; Sinusoidal excitations; Diodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538638644,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This approach chooses the precise wavelet for Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). The motor phase currents are continuously monitored and discrete wavelet analysis is performed to obtain the approximate and detailed coefficients at different levels. The wavelet functions used are db1, db2, db3, db4, sym2 and sym3. Various statistical parameters such as standard deviation, inter quartile range, norm and harmonic mean of approximate and detailed coefficients have been calculated. These parameters are obtained for both healthy and faulty conditions of the motor at various load levels. Simulation results indicate that norm parameter of the detailed coefficients at healthy condition is equal for all three phases. However, during the fault condition, the norm of sixth level detailed coefficients of db1 wavelet corresponding to the faulty phase shows an increment in its value compared to other two healthy phases. This variation is valid for all load conditions. Hence, db1 selected as one of the best wavelets for turn-to-turn fault detection. Also among the statistical parameter, norm is observed as the accurate feature for stator fault detection. Hardware results agree with the simulation results. © 2017 IEEE.","Condition monitoring of induction motor; fault detection; statistical parameter; turn-to-turn; wavelet analysis","Asynchronous machinery; Condition monitoring; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Food products; Induction motors; Signal processing; Stators; Wavelet analysis; Discrete wavelet analysis; Inter quartile ranges; Motor current signature analysis; Standard deviation; Statistical parameters; Stator fault detection; Three phase induction motor drives; Turn-to-turn faults; Fault detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538638644,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In this paper, a novel grid energy storage system for large-scale PV systems is discussed. With the proposed configuration, the battery charging and discharging are carried out through an AC voltage regulator which is connected in series to the line. For this system, cascaded H-bridge (CHB)based PV-Inverter which is suitable for a high power application is selected. In case of failure in one H-Bridge of a CHB inverter, it is difficult to integrate solar inverter with the grid as the voltages of inverter and grid are not matched. Fault tolerant operation of the CHB-based PV-Inverter can also be achieved through the proposed configuration. In this paper, basic operation and control of a voltage regulator, application of the voltage regulator in grid energy storage systems, fault tolerant operation of a CHB inverter through the voltage regulator are presented. To validate the performance of the controls proposed, Real-time simulations are carried out by interfacing the simulated power circuit with the real controller card with the help of an Opal-RT make real-time simulator.

This unique characteristic attracted many promising applications and the one among is battlefield communication. The war troops at the edge of the network do not have any computing infrastructure for communication. Therefore MANET plays a vital role in battlefield communication. Since MANET is openness to eavesdropping, routing of information causes vulnerabilities and degrades the performance of network. This necessitated developing a MANET with a novel intrusion detection system to provide reliability and security to the battlefield communication. This paper proposes a Di-Fuzzy logic technique which provides two phase detection for intrusion detection in the network. It works in a cluster based routing environment to co-ordinate and control the entire network. The selection of cluster head is based on the node with the maximum energy to improve the life time of the network. The proposed technique is simulated in network simulator NS 2.8 and the performance is evaluated by comparing with the existing Fuzzy based IDS (F-IDS) & intrusion detection and adaptive response (IDAR) system. From comparison the proposed Di-Fuzzy logic technique improves its performance in all metrics and thus provides a safe environment for battlefield communication. © 2017 IEEE.","Battlefield communication; Cluster based routing; Fuzzy logic technique; Intrusion Detection; MANET","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Network routing; Network security; Wireless ad hoc networks; Adaptive response; Battlefield communications; Cluster-based; Cluster-based routing; Computing infrastructures; Fuzzy logic techniques; Intrusion Detection Systems; MANET; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059058,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This paper aims to extract features from the different renal abnormalities to discriminate between the normal and abnormal conditions. Two filters, median and wiener filter are used to remove the speckle noise in US (ultrasound) images. A picture quality performance technique is implemented to identify the quality of the images. Peak to signal noise ratio (PSNR) and Mean squared error (MSR) is used to verify the enhanced images. The preprocessed images are then segmented using FCM (fuzzy c-means clustering technique) which yields better results to find Region of interest (ROI). The statistical features along with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features and Texture features are extracted and analyzed. It is found that features like Energy, Variance and kurtosis are seen to be higher in the normal kidney images than the renal abnormalities. The features can be used to discriminate between normal and abnormal renal conditions.

Many weight generation methods exist in the literature under intuitionistic fuzzy setting, but they have some limitations which can be pointed out as: the entropy measures used in entropy weight methods are invalid in many situations and also there are lots of entropy formulae for intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which will be better to use, and thus a confusion may arise; the other weight generation methods may lose some information since it needs to transform the intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix into an interval-valued decision matrix. This conversion distorts experts original opinions. In this point of view, to overcome these demerits, we develop a weight generation method without changing the original decision information. The proposed method maximizes the average degree of satisfiability and minimizes the average degree of non-satisfiability of each alternative over a set of attributes, simultaneously. This leads to formulate a multi-objective programming problem (MOPP) to compute the final comprehensive value for each alternative. The scenario of an MOPP itself is subjective and can be modeled by fuzzy decision making problem due to the conflicting objectives and the way of human choice on conflict resolution. This problem is solved by using particle swarm optimization scheme, and the evaluation procedure is illustrated by means of a numerical example. This work has also justified the proposed approach by analyzing a comparative study. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Fuzzy optimization; Intuitionistic fuzzy set; Multi-objective programming problem; Particle swarm optimization","Entropy; Formal logic; Fuzzy sets; Matrix algebra; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Conflicting objectives; Decision information; Decision-making problem; Entropy weight method; Fuzzy Decision making; Fuzzy optimization; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Multi-objective programming problem; Decision making","Das, S.; Department of Mathematics, IIT PatnaIndia; email: satyajitnit.das@gmail.com",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

The renewable power will also meet the future demand when existing fuel will be exhausted. Solar power is considerably preferred on account of its easy availability all year round. In this paper, a very efficient way of generating grid quality power from solar power has been presented. For achieving high efficiency, solar DC power is directly converted through high frequency PWM switching based inverter to grid power eliminating any buck-boost power converter stage. MPPT controlled has been implemented in the inverter itself in the process DC to AC conversion. The basic inverter unit is designed at 3KW level to optimize efficiency. The inverter is based on transformer less design along with other high MTBF components resulting reliability, longevity and efficiency to a peak value. Output power boosting is achieved by adding number of 3KW inverters in parallel at the AC output side in an N+1 configuration. This configuration further improves the overall performance compared to a single high power inverter as far as MTBT, shading and power enhancing point of view is considered. © 2017 IEEE.","Efficiency; Grid; Inverter; MPPT; MTBF; N+1 configuration","Binary alloys; DC-DC converters; Efficiency; Electric power transmission networks; Global warming; Maximum power point trackers; Solar energy; Grid; High frequency HF; High-efficiency; High-power inverters; Inverter; MTBF; Optimize efficiency; Power generating systems; Electric inverters",,"Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538622155,,,"English","Ind.

For medium and high power applications, multi-stage VSI (series and/or parallel combinations) with suitable filter (for obtaining near sinusoidal waveform at the output) may be a solution but there are problems in matching of different stages, selection of bulky transformer and proper filter. The quality of both the output voltage and current waveforms with minimum ripple is obtained using high frequency switching along with various PWM techniques. These conventional two level inverters have some limitations in operating at high frequencies mainly due to switching losses and constraints in device rating. The problem is resolved by means of multilevel inverters (MLIs) which utilize lower switching frequencies and give high voltages with improved total harmonic distortion (THD) without use of filter. This paper gives a brief review on different MLI techniques with advantages and disadvantages of each technique. The main disadvantages of MLI are requirement for isolated power supplies, design complexity and switching control circuits for proper elimination of lower order harmonics. © 2017 IEEE.","Inverter; MLI; Power semiconductor devices; PWM technique; THD","Nanotechnology; Power semiconductor devices; Pulse width modulation; Semiconductor devices; Switching; High power applications; High-frequency switching; Inverter; Isolated power supplies; Lower order harmonics; PWM techniques; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Voltage source inverter; Electric inverters",,"Taki G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053346,,,"English","Int.

SEPIC converter decreases the lower harmonic component value in the generator. SEPIC converter offers several advantages over other DC-DC converters like harmonics can be minimized and efficiency is thus improved in SEPIC converter. As the number of levels is high in inverter, harmonic content value is reduced so that there is no need of filter.

So sentiment analysis (SA) is used to find the users opinion about a particular topic, product or problem in a more efficient way.

This paper proposes a system that will automatically recognise the facial expression from the image and classify emotions for final decision. The system uses a simplified method called 'Viola Jones Face Detection' algorithm for face localization. Then facial features are extracted using three methods 'Zernike moments', 'LBP' and 'DCT transform'. The different feature vectors are combined together using a subset feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of recognition and classification process. Finally the combined features are trained and classified using SVM, Random Forest and KNN classifier.

For a multilevel inverter, attempt is to obtain an output voltage which is near sinusoidal in shape. The switching angles and the voltage levels are decided in such a way so as to maximize the fundamental component with minimum THD. In this paper, it is shown how a simple method like Grey Analysis method can be used to decide the switching angles and voltage levels of a multilevel inverter so as to get an output with maximum fundamental component and reduced total harmonic distortion (THD). For a seven level inverter, six output waveforms are assumed and then the best suitable one from amongst these six waveforms is found out using this method. It is the magnitude of fundamental component and presence of harmonics, especially the lower order harmonics, which affects the output of any inverter. Thus a Multivariable Grey Relational Function is generated by quantifying the effects of multiple factors, i.e. magnitude of fundamental component and also the weighted (WTHD) effect of its harmonics, into a single index. The result thus obtained was authenticated using simulations in Matlab Simulink platform. © 2017 IEEE.","Grey Analysis Method; multilevel inverter; Multivariable Grey Relational Function; WTH","Energy conversion; Harmonic analysis; MATLAB; System theory; Fundamental component; Grey analysis; Lower order harmonics; Matlab Simulink platform; Multi variables; Multilevel inverter; Renewable energy conversion systems; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509066674,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Scholars have rarely addressed this issue in group decision making process. The aggregation operators that use DMs' relative importance (weights) as one of their parameters for evaluation have strictly set a constraint that, the sum of relative importance must be equal to unity. This constraint does not fit well with decision making process as the weight values for the DMs are being forcibly estimated without offering actual freedom in such estimation. To relax this strict constraint from the aggregation process, in this paper, we make efforts to propose a new aggregation operator which considers no such constraint on DMs' weight values. This operator is an extension to simple intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometry (SIFWG) operator. The reason for choosing SIFWG for extension is evident from the strength and simplicity of SIFWG operator. Finally, an illustrative example is demonstrated to realize the strength of the proposed aggregation operator. © 2017 IEEE.","Aggregation; Group decision making; Relative importance; SIFWG operator and Intuitionistic fuzzy set","Agglomeration; Computer circuits; Fuzzy sets; Mathematical operators; Aggregation operator; Aggregation process; Decision making process; Group Decision Making; Group decision making process; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Relative importance; Decision making",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049660,,,"English","Proc.

This topology is applied for the inverter to increase output voltage of PV module. The conventional inverters has more size and low efficiency hence to overcome this drawback the flyback inverters are connected in parallel which improve efficiency and switching devices get reduced. Flyback inverter topology also provides the isolation between PV source and load. It also boosts up the voltage supplied by PV source. The DC power output of solar panel is converted into AC form by this topology with higher efficiency and low losses. Low power from PV system is increased by employing this technique in inverter system which mainly reduces the size of the converter. Therefore, this technique is more efficient than the conventional technique which is analyzed by MATLAB Simulink. © 2017 IEEE.","Control strategy for switches; Efficiency; Flyback inverter; Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); Solar energy","Computer circuits; Efficiency; Electric inverters; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Topology; Control strategies; Conventional inverters; Conventional techniques; Flyback inverter; High power applications; Interleaved flyback converter; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Performance analysis; Power converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049660,,,"English","Proc.

For this a new idea is proposed which aims at designing a Gabor filter that makes accurate detection of diseases. We use an efficient pipelined architecture for input. Image segmentation for the detection of diseases is done using Gabor filter that in turn uses shift-add CORDIC algorithm for making the designing of Gabor filter easier. In addition to this algorithm, we use a new algorithm called Variable Thresholding algorithm that sets a threshold value during the decision making period. The algorithm is named variable because, the threshold value can be varied depending upon the diseases we are going to detect. All these algorithms are written in VHDL Language in MODELSIM software, which makes the designing and decision making process more effective. This technique is also implemented on FPGA/CPLD kit that shows us the presence of disease manually through lighting of LED's.

Duty ratio of the pulse signal sent to the power MOSFET has been varied for buck and boost operation and subsequently motor parameters across the three separate establishments have been compared. Design and simulation of the converter circuits have been done using MATLAB/Simulink. The motor parameters under discussion are stator back emf, rotor speed and electromagnetic torque. A conscious effort has been made to present the parameter values in an easily comparable manner for the three topologies.

A two level logic is chosen for faster convergence with variable correction steps for the fuzzy logic controller. The maximum power point voltage window is identified from the PV array characteristics and the rule base for the two levels is developed. The system is tested for two array ratings of 5.8 kW and 8.7 kW to bring out the generic nature of the proposed fuzzy controller for power tracking.

This results into increased power-densities within the chip and power-density directly converges into temperature. The increase in temperature reduces the yield of the circuit. On the contrary, reduction of power and power-density increases the area. So, there is a trade-off among area, power, and power-density. Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) based combinational circuit synthesis is quite popular. Suitable input variable ordering through BDDs can optimize the said circuit parameters. Proposed work presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach to select a suitable BDD ordering in its reduced ordered form to optimize the objective parameters without performance degradation. Proposed approach saves more than 44% in area and power, and 6% in power-density with respect to auto-order and in-order BDD representation.

ARIMA was not able to capture nonlinear patterns precisely, hence nonlinear models such as Neural Network, XGBoost and SVM were used. Nonlinear models performed better than ARIMA and gave low RMSE. Then, to further optimize the performance, composite models were designed using hybrid technique and decomposition technique. Hybrid ARIMA-ARNN, Hybrid ARIMA-XGBoost, Hybrid ARIMA-SVM were used and all of them performed better than their respective individual models. Then, the composite model was designed using STL Decomposition where the decomposed components namely seasonal, trend and remainder components were forecasted by Snaive, ARIMA and XGBoost.

Also the reactive power flow in the whole unit cannot be regulated. So all these issues can be minimized by improving the existing topology of grid tied transformer-less inverter.

Recently many Multi-cloud storage services have been proposed but most of them focus on the single specific organization and file formats. In addition most providers use attribute based encryption which encrypts only particular database fields which reduces the trust of the many individuals and organizations. The biggest challenge that the present business world faces in multi-cloud storage is that there is no single standard architecture and procedure that can meet the requirements of the individuals and organizations. In order to address this challenge, this paper presents an effective architectural framework with a standard algorithm which would enable to enhance the secure data sharing through dynamic index based cryptographic data slicing.

We already had known that the speckle noise which corrupts the visual estimation of UltraSound [US] imaging is a multiplicative noise. The searches for efficient despeckling filters are still a proper challenge at the crossing of statistics and functional analysis. The aim of this work was to carry out a brief study of speckle denoising filters. The denoising filters studied in this paper are grouped under the following types such as adaptive filters, Partial Differential Equation [PDE] based filters, transform domain filters, non-local restoration filters and fuzzy logic based filters. The study of these filters shows the following results. Adaptive filters are based on the statement that the Speckle noise is basically a multiplicative noise. PDE based approaches used PDEs by defining a suitable cost function. Threshold estimation for transform domain is an essential problem in transform domain systems. Non-local restoration filters performed well when compared with the other state of art filters. Different fuzzy logic based filters are presented to eliminate the speckle noise in medical images. Fuzzy rule based filters is an alternative solution for the classical logical system.

But if any one switch of conventional multilevel inverters (NPC or flying capacitor) fails, the entire configuration has to be shut down. In this regard, a multi-level inverter configuration is proposed in this paper which can be operated during the failure of any power electronic switching device/isolated dc source. The proposed configuration is developed by using four isolated DC sources, nine two-quadrant switches and three four-quadrant switches. Requirement of number of switching devices is considerably reduced compared to conventional multilevel inverters. Detailed analysis is carried out to operate the proposed inverter configuration during the failure of different switching devices/isolated dc sources. The proposed configuration is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and results are presented for different fault conditions. This configuration can be extended to get more number of voltage levels by cascading proposed inverter units. © 2017 IEEE.","Fault tolerant systems; Multi level-inverters; PV applications; Sine-Triangle PWM","Computer circuits; Fault tolerance; MATLAB; Outages; Switching; Fault conditions; Fault tolerant systems; Four quadrant switch; Harmonic profile; Multilevel inverter; Power electronic switching; Pv applications; Switching devices; Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049660,,,"English","Proc.

The generation electrical power from fossil fuel releases several impurities into atmosphere and this become excrescent if the generating unit is fueled with Multiple Fuel Sources (MFS). Inclusion of this issue in the operational task is a welcome perspective. Nevertheless numerous published reports deal only the cost effective operation, this work proposes a more accurate and practical operational model considering valve-point effects, CO2 emission and MFS. This power system operational problem is constructed as a multi-objective non-linear optimization problem which considers conflicting objectives. To address this problem, the modern nature inspired algorithm called Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) has been chosen as the primal optimizer. The fuzzy decision making mechanism is adopted to determine the best compromised solution in multi-objective framework. Further, the ALO is applied to solve the operational problem taking into consideration the MFS and tie line capacity between different areas of the power system. To validate the effectiveness of ALO, it is implemented on the standard test system comprises of 10 generating units and various kinds of power system operations are performed. Moreover, the comparison and performance analysis confirm that the current proposal is found enhanced in terms of solution quality. © 2017 IEEE.","Ant lion optimizer; Economic/Emission dispatch; Multi-area dispatch; Multiple fuel sources; Valve-point effects","Computer circuits; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Fuel systems; Fuels; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Problem solving; Economic/environmental dispatches; Multi areas; Multiple fuels; Nature inspired algorithms; Non-linear optimization problems; Optimizers; Power system operations; Valve point effects; Electric load dispatching",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049660,,,"English","Proc.

Harmonics and switching losses can be reduced by this topology. And reduction of switches also reduces the cost. Multilevel inverters are used in industry for medium and high voltage application.

Therefore, in the efficiency of the global PV system, MPPTs take the foremost place. A DC-DC boost converter boosts the DC voltage generated by the photovoltaic system. Various MPPT algorithms pilot these trackers out of which Perturb and Observe (P&O) technique is emphasised upon as it is highly simple to implement within electronic programmable circuits. This paper incorporates into the model various environmental factors to study the behaviour of the PV panel output of which is controlled by MPPT trackers.

The management and processing of huge data sets are time-consuming, costly, and hindrance to research. So, the process to store, manage, analyze and extract meaningful value from the vast volume of data is a big challenge to researchers. Data warehouse is a Decision Support System (DSS) technology that allows extracting, grouping and analyzing historical data from different sources in order to discover information relevant to decision making. Climate data is collected and stored in the national climatic data center (NCDC), the format of dataset support a rich set of meteorological elements. The data warehouse has the ability to manage data having a huge size in Terabytes range or higher, data is collected from different meteorological stations and stored in records to analyze it later in future. The process of big data analysis has become increasingly important for climate analysis field, which requires rapid and transparent data access. Recently, a new distributed computing paradigm, called MapReduce and it is implemented in an open source Hadoop, which has been widely adopted due to its impressive scalability and flexibility to handle structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual data model and the implementation of hybrid data warehouse model to store NCDC's weather variables.

Cyber-Attacks are deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises, and networks. Deception, i.e., the act of making someone believe in something that is not true, could be a way of countering cyber-Attacks. In this paper, we propose a real-Time simulation environment ('Deception Game'), which we used to evaluate and model the decision making of hackers in the presence of deception. In an experiment, using a repeated Deception Game (N = 100 participants), we analyzed the effect of two factors on participants' decisions to attack a computer network: Amount of deception used and the timing of deception. Across 10-Attack trials, the amount of deception used was manipulated at 2-levels: low and high. The timing of deception was manipulated at 2-levels: early and late. Results revealed that using late and high deception caused a reduction in attacks on regular webserver compared to early and low deception. Furthermore, we developed a cognitive model of hacker's decision-making using Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory, a theory of decisions from experience. The parameters obtained from the model helped explain the reasons for our experimental results. © 2017 IEEE.","Amount of deception; Computational Modeling; Cyber-Attacks; Deception; Hackers; Honeypots; IBL; Timing of deception; Zero day attacks","Computation theory; Computer games; Computer networks; Crime; Decision making; Decision theory; Network security; Personal computing; Timing circuits; Amount of deception; Computational model; Cyber-attacks; Deception; Hackers; Honeypots; Timing of deception; Zero day attack; Computer crime",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509050604,,,"English","Int.

The Tata Indica converted PHEV is considered with designed specification of the electric drivetrain. The energy management system decides the preferred operating points for the different powertrain subsystems (i.e. set points for the engine and motor as per the state of battery) so that the overall cost of operating the vehicle (fuel consumption) and or emissions is minimized. However, fuel economy and emissions minimization are conflicting objectives, hence smart control strategies need to be developed to minimize either fuel consumption or emissions and or both for particular selected vehicle with a trade-off between them. In this work due to the requirement of simplicity, practically implementable and other advantages like robustness and reliability of a fuzzy logic, a fuzzy logic control based strategy is used for deciding operating points of engine and motor. This is then used to simulate a complete vehicle. Simulation of selected conventional vehicle and converted PHEV has done in MATLAB.

Texture is an important spatial feature, useful for identifying facial objects of interest in an image. The most popular statistical methods used to measure the textural information of images are the grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and the texture spectrum (TS) Approach. The major problem of these two approaches is the dimensionality. This paper derives significant local information by deriving a new integrated matrix using fuzzy based texture unit and GLCM for efficient face recognition. The features derived from this integrated matrix provide detailed and complete texture information of about the human faces. Local binary pattern (LBP) operator is a powerful operator to extract the discriminative facial features and this method may fail to detect the illumination variation and facial expressions accurately. Noise is the crucial problem related to methods based on LBP also. To address these issues, the present paper derives a fuzzy logic on texture unit to discriminate the local information precisely than LBP and to reduce the dimensionality. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated using complex facial datasets, namely Yale and american telephone and telegraph company (AT&T). The present method is compared with methods based on LBP and the results indicate the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Dimensionality; GLCM; LBP; Texture spectrum; Texture unit","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computation theory; Fuzzy logic; Image texture; Matrix algebra; Dimensionality; GLCM; Grey level co-occurrence matrixes; Illumination variation; Local binary pattern operators; Textural information; Texture information; Texture spectrum; Face recognition",,"Niranjan Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063994,,,"English","Proc.

Supervised classification approaches are dependent on kernels or distance metrics to handle complex manifolds as they warp feature space for effective classification with less complex boundaries between classes. Proposed approach identifies control points (Voronoi diagram) by exploring the structures of class specific manifolds which constructs complex boundaries with piecewise linear nature. Such a framework has less number of hyperparameters to tweak resulting easy control and understanding of the system. The learning characteristics of the proposed algorithm has been depicted on toy and optical coherence tomography data set. It has illustrated effective performance in identification of retinal pathologies and compared against off-the-shelf classifiers with various parameters.

In WSN, effective use of energy resource is one of the challenging research issues as the battery limits the lifetime of sensor node. The Rumor Routing has advantages in energy saving by making full use of two features: clustering structure and next-hop scheme. This rumor routing algorithm in WSN allows query source to distribute query to identify source which helps to get timely query message but the energy efficiency is made better using hierarchical method by clustering formation, where the appropriate selection of cluster head reduces energy conservation. So we have fuzzy logic as the proposed method which is based on three features : Centrality, Energy, Distance. The mobile co-ordinator is used in this method to increase the network efficiency. Thus fuzzy logic can effectively avoid the problems that occur in RR and can provide more energy-efficient routing paths. The performance between fuzzy logic using mobile co-ordinator and RR are evaluated by simulations. This simulation results indicate that compared with RR, the fuzzy logic can save energy consumption, provide better path, and increases delivery rate. © 2017 IEEE.","fuzzy logic; Mobile coordinator; RR; WSN","Computer circuits; Data communication systems; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Energy efficient routing; Hierarchical method; Mobile coordinator; Network efficiency; Query message; Real-time application; Research issues; Energy efficiency",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

Only a small fraction of the available solar energy is used in practice. Solar powered electrical generation relies on photovoltaic system and heat engines. To harvest the solar energy, the most common way is to use photovoltaic panels which will receive photon energy from sun and convert to electrical energy. The efficiency of PV module is very low and power output depends on solar insulation level and ambient temperature, so maximization of power output with greater efficiency is of special interest. In this paper, an interleaved soft switching boost converter (ISSBC) for a photovoltaic (PV) power-generation system is proposed. The topology used raises the efficiency for the dc/dc converter of the PV power conditioning system (PVPCS), and it minimizes switching losses by adopting a resonant soft-switching method. This project proposes a novel soft-switching interleaved boost converter composed of two shunted elementary boost conversion units and an auxiliary inductor. The proposed controller scheme utilizes PWM techniques to regulate the output power of interleaved boost converter at its maximum possible value and simultaneously controls the charging process of battery. This converter is able to turn on both the active power switches at zero voltage to reduce their switching losses and evidently raise the conversion efficiency. Since the two parallel-operated elementary boost units are identical, operation analysis and design for the converter module becomes quite simple. The resulting system has high-efficiency, lower-cost, very fast tracking speed. The circuit will be simulated using MATLAB Simulink. © 2017 IEEE.","Boost converter; Cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter; interleaved; maximum power pointTracking (MPPT); photovoltaic (PV) power-generation systems; resonant converter; soft-switching; Total Harmonic Distortion(THD)","Bridge circuits; Data communication systems; Electric inverters; Embedded systems; Heat engines; Photovoltaic cells; Power converters; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Switching; BOOST converter; Cascaded h-bridge multilevel inverters; interleaved; Point-tracking; Power generation systems; Resonant converters; Total harmonic distortion (THD); DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

Each components of the power train should be properly designed so as to achieve the maximum efficiency and the desired driving performances. Since the battery's energy density is low, an ultracapacitor (UC) has been proposed to be used along with the battery to assist it during transient states and thereby increasing battery's capacity and lifespan. The voltage level and dynamic characteristic of the energy storage components are normally different from each other and therefore, a DC-DC converter has been incorporated into the vehicle drive train. The sizing of electrical storage components and controlling energy flow determines the overall efficiency and also its cycle life. Hence the frequency splitting based energy management algorithm has been used for the control of power flow across battery, ultracapacitor and the DC-link. © 2017 IEEE.","bidirectional DC-DC converter; drive train; hybrid electric vehicle(HEV); PMDC motor; ultracapacitor","Automobile drivers; DC motors; Electric batteries; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric motors; Hybrid vehicles; Land vehicle propulsion; Secondary batteries; Smart city; Supercapacitor; Traction motors; Vehicles; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Drive train; Driving performance; Dynamic characteristics; Energy management algorithms; Energy storage components; Frequency splittings; PMDC motor; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062553,,,"English","TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

If the battery state of charge (SOC) is between the maximum and minimum limits, the bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC) connected to the battery is controlled to maintain DC bus voltage and power balance. Thus, the DC bus voltage is kept under stringent limits by adaptive droop control of BDC. The DC bus voltage set point is varied within the limits to account for SOC based battery management. If the battery SOC is unfit for charging/discharging, load management is deployed to serve the purpose. The boost converter connected to the solar panel (PV converter) is either used for optimal power point tracking (OPPT) or for voltage control in the absence of battery. The methods are investigated on the basis of bus voltage profile and utilization of solar PV source for different ranges of generation and loads using simulation and hardware. © 2017 IEEE.","Droop DC Microgrid; Energy management; Solar PV; Voltage control","Charging (batteries); DC-DC converters; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Energy management; Secondary batteries; Smart city; Solar energy; Voltage control; Battery state of charge; Bidirectional dc dc converters (BDC); Charging/discharging; Dc micro-grid; Management techniques; Optimal power points; Real-time energy management; Solar PVs; Battery management systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062553,,,"English","TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

This paper focuses on a new topology of 7-level multilevel inverter (MLI) named as improved H-bridge MLI (IHB MLI) with less number of switches than conventional type with 12 switches, which results in reduction of switching losses, switching stress and converter cost. This paper also presents the most relevant control technique, i.e. selective harmonic elimination technique. Harmonic mitigation in MLIs is a complex optimization problem that involves non-linear equations. Particle swarm optimization is used to solve these non-linear transcendental equations and thus switching angles are calculated. Switching angles corresponding to best objective value are used for designing the 7-level IHB MLI in MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, it is compared with the 5-level IHB MLI topology.

Decision making queries posed against a large data warehouse, are typically analytic, intricate and recurring in nature. Such queries contain a lot of join operations over large volumes of records. Answering these queries efficiently is a critical concern in the data warehouse environment. One way to address this problem is by materializing views in the data warehouse. All views cannot be materialized due to storage space constraint. Materializing an optimal subset of views is shown to be an NP-Hard problem. Alternatively views can be selected either empirically or based on some heuristic like greedy, randomized, evolutionary, swarm based etc. In this paper, a discrete genetic operator based particle swarm optimization (DGPSO) has been used to select Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice. Further, experiments based comparison of the DGPSO based view selection algorithm with the fundamental view selection algorithm HRUA shows that the former is able to select better quality views for materialization. © 2017 IEEE.","Data Warehouse; Materialized View Selection; Particle Swarm Optimizatio; Swarm Intelligence","Computational complexity; Decision making; Digital storage; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Genetic operators; Join operation; Large volumes; Materialized view selection; Optimal subsets; Particle swarm; Storage spaces; View selection; Data warehouses",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

These approaches help the doctors and radiologists in their decision making during decease identification and decision making. Image classification is usually done by checking image visual content or semantic content similarity. Image content may be represented by its visual features referring to mathematical attributes or high level description based semantic attributes. Content similarity is done by using similarity and dissimilarity measures or distance metrics. As image attributes are wide in range, the similarity measure worked well for one feature set may not show the similar performance for other. For this reason in this paper we explored geometrical and statistical dissimilarity measures viz. Manhattan, Cosine, Chi-square and Cramer distances and their effect with respect to image intensity feature set and wavelet based texture feature set. Through experimentation, we have drawn certain conclusions on the performance of these distance metrics in classification and retrieval of IRMA CLEFmed 2007 and 2008 image sets.

Typically, a timetable problem has many possible solutions in the initial search space, each with a distinct fitness level. In this paper we propose a multi-stage hybrid solution based on an evolutionary algorithm where the initial population is first generated that satisfies all the hard constraints. A user configurable fitness function is used to test the soft constraints. Solutions with fitness value above a certain threshold are then mutated to improve the fitness level of the next population and an acceptable optimal solution can then be selected interactively by the user. This unique interactive approach with configurable fitness functions allows more control to the user over the selection of an optimal solution and helps in multi-objective decision making. © 2017 IEEE.","Evolutionary Algorithms; Interactive Selection; Multi-Objective Optimization; Mutation; Timetabling","Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Health; Optimal systems; Optimization; Scheduling; Automatic Generation; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Initial population; Interactive approach; Interactive Selection; Multi objective decision making; Mutation; Timetabling; Multiobjective optimization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043811,,,"English","Int.

These problems are mainly due to the hysteresis controllers. Appreciable reduction of torque and flux ripple can be achieved by increasing the inverter switching frequency. Most of the torque ripples reduction methods in literature are centered on this concept. The hysteresis based approach also results in variable switching frequency that depends on operating conditions at particular speed. Hence a method for increasing the switching frequency and at the same time maintaining constant switching frequency is needed. Most researches have chosen the space vector pulse width modulation based DTC (SVM-DTC) scheme. In this paper, first the torque and flux ripple in the conventional DTC method are shown and the improvement achieved by using proposed DTC method based on slip angle is presented. A new method such as slip angle control of induction motor drive based on DTC are proposed, analyzed, simulated, and tested. It is shown that this method progressively reduces torque and flux ripple. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Control of electrical drive; direct flux control; direct torque control; induction motor drive; speed PI controller design; torque PI controller design; two-level voltage source inverter","Damage detection; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Electric motors; Hysteresis; Induction motors; Switching; Switching frequency; Torque; Torque control; Vector spaces; Voltage control; Direct torque control; Electrical drives; Flux control; Induction motor drive; P-i controller designs; Voltage source inverter; Controllers","Vinay Kumar, T.; Electrical Engineering Department, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: vinaykumar@nitw.ac.in",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",02286203,,IMSIE,,"English","Int J Modell Simul",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019656698

The proposed control structure integrates a direct adaptive backstepping control approach with a single functional layer Hermite neural network (HNN). Buck converter is a variable structure model with a highly uncertain loading pattern. Hence an estimator based on HNN is employed to estimate the load perturbations influencing the converter. The accurate and timely information about the unanticipated load resistance strengthens the control law in order to attain the desired objective. The online adaptive laws are derived based on Lyapunov stability criterion ensuring the overall stability of the buck converter equipped with the proposed control. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by subjecting the buck converter to a wide range variations in load resistance, input voltage and reference output voltage. Further, the merits of proposed control are highlighted by comparing the performance with the standard adaptive backstepping control technique under identical conditions of simulation study. Performance indices such as peak overshoot, peak undershoot and settling time have been evaluated, which clearly indicate the outperformance of proposed control. © 2016 IEEE.","backstepping control; buck converter; DC-DC converter; neural network","Adaptive control systems; Artificial intelligence; Backstepping; Electric inverters; Network layers; Neural networks; Soft computing; Stability criteria; Adaptive backstepping control; Back-stepping controls; Buck converters; DC-DC buck converter; Direct adaptive control; Lyapunov stability criterion; Novel control scheme; Variable structure model; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036967,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

A grid current feedback based modified $dq$-current control technique for interfacing inverter is developed in order to achieve constant loading on the grid, transient-free operation, and power factor improvement close to unity power factor (UPF) of the utility grid during sudden load variations. This technique does not require separate calculation of reference reactive component and harmonics component of currents hence reduces control circuit complexity. In addition, it requires only three voltage and three current sensors. Three phase AANF is developed and is used for online extraction of utility voltage phase angle to generate synchronized reference current signals for interfacing inverter. AANF is used because of its adjustable accuracy and amplitude adaptability even under unbalanced voltage sag and swell, frequency variation, and distorted grid conditions. Fast and accurate behavior of three phase AANF improves the dynamic response of entire DG system control performance for sudden load variations. The dynamic behavior of the proposed grid interfaced DG system is experimentally evaluated in maintaining constant loading on grid, transient-free operation, and power factor improvement close to UPF operation of the utility grid, by compensating total reactive power and harmonic current demanded by variable linear as well as nonlinear load. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Amplitude adaptive notch filter (AANF); grid synchronization; grid-connected inverters; power quality improvement","Adaptive control systems; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Distributed power generation; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Electric power factor; Electric power transmission networks; Notch filters; Power quality; Real time control; Synchronization; Adaptive notch filters; Adaptive synchronizations; Current control techniques; Distributed generation system; Grid connected inverters; Grid synchronizations; Power quality improvement; Real-time implementations; Electric power system control","Suryawanshi, H.M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Visvesvaraya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: hmsuryawanshi@eee.vnit.ac.in",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Assessment and management of such wound is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Currently, precise wound bed estimation depends on the clinical judgment and remains a difficult task. The paper introduces a novel method for ulcer boundary demarcation and estimation, using optical images captured by a hand-held digital camera. The proposed approach involves gray based fuzzy similarity measure using spatial knowledge of an image. The fuzzy measure is used to construct similarity matrix. The best color channel was chosen by calculating the mean contrast for 26 different color channels of 14 color spaces. It was found that Db color channel has highest mean contrast which provide best segmentation result in comparison with other color channels. The fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) method was applied on Db color channel for effective delineation of wound region. The segmented wound regions were effectively post-processed using various morphological operations. The performance of proposed segmentation technique was validated by ground-truth images labeled by two experienced dermatologists and a surgeon. The FSC approach was tested on 70 images. FSC effectively segmented targeted ulcer boundary yielding 91.5% segmentation accuracy, 86.7%, Dice index and 79.0%. Jaccard score. The sensitivity and specificity was found to be 87.3% and 95.7% respectively. The performance evaluation shows the robustness of the proposed method of wound area segmentation and its potential to be used for designing patient comfort centric wound care system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chronic wound; Color constancy; Digital image processing; Fuzzy similarity measure; Segmentation; Spectral clustering","Clustering algorithms; Color; Dermatology; Diseases; Fuzzy logic; Geometrical optics; Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Optical data processing; Physiological models; Chronic wounds; Color constancy; Fuzzy similarity measure; Morphological operations; Performance evaluations; Segmentation techniques; Sensitivity and specificity; Spectral clustering; Image segmentation; adult; aged; Article; chronic wound; clinical evaluation; color; contrast; controlled study; decision making; evaluation study; female; fuzzy system; health care system; human; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; major clinical study; male; noise reduction; patient comfort; priority journal; ulcer; wound care; clinical trial; decubitus; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; image processing; injury; multicenter study; procedures; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Pressure Ulcer; Wounds and Injuries","Chakraborty, C.; School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: chandanc@smst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28479109","English","Comput.

Assortative, relational, and proximity mechanisms are the recognized social processes that are responsible for the formation of these dyadic ties. In this paper, we develop an agent-based model that derives its essence from social processes, fuzzy game theory, and social network analysis. The process of dyadic friendship formation depends on the agent's (participant's) spatial configuration, attributes affecting friendship, and interaction with other agents. To model these interactions, we use fuzzy iterated prisoner's dilemma (Fuzzy-IPD) utilizing the decision factors contributing to similar social processes. These strategies have been independently discussed in previously published studies. We, however, use them in combination to design a descriptive model with different experimental settings in an ad-hoc simulation framework. Using an integrationist approach, we blend multiple individual components of friendship formation to construct a comprehensive model. The analysis of the model thus developed reveals a possible interaction pattern responsible for the evolution of the layered associations. This paper further validates various levels of friendship ties (strong ties, medium ties, and weak ties) in social networks as reported in the published sociological studies. © 2013 IEEE.","Agent based modelling; dyadic friendship formation; fuzzy logic; game theory; simulation of social networks; social dynamics; social evolution","Analytical models; Association reactions; Autonomous agents; Computation theory; Computational methods; Game theory; Heuristic algorithms; Mathematical models; Agent-based modelling; Computational model; Dyadic Friendship Formation; Social dynamics; Social evolution; Social network services; Fuzzy logic","Goyal, R.; University School of Information, Communication and Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha UniversityIndia; email: rinkajgoyal@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030778171

Among the discovered miRNAs, not all are important for cancer detection. In this regard a fuzzy mutual information (FMI) based grouping and miRNA selection method (FMIGS) is developed to identify the miRNAs responsible for a particular cancer. First, the miRNAs are ranked and divided into several groups. Then the most important group is selected among the generated groups. Both the steps viz., ranking of miRNAs and selection of the most relevant group of miRNAs, are performed using FMI. Here the number of groups is automatically determined by the grouping method. After the selection process, redundant miRNAs are removed from the selected set of miRNAs as per user's necessity. In a part of the investigation we proposed a FMI based particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for selecting relevant miRNAs, where FMI is used as a fitness function to determine the fitness of the particles. The effectiveness of FMIGS and FMI based PSO is tested on five data sets and their efficiency in selecting relevant miRNAs are demonstrated. The superior performance of FMIGS to some existing methods are established and the biological significance of the selected miRNAs is observed by the findings of the biological investigation and publicly available pathway analysis tools.

In this study, main attention is paid to improve power quality and tracking performance of a distributed generation (DG) interfacing system under various perturbations. The inherent delay in convergence of conventional repetitive controller (RC) is reduced by introducing a low pass filter in delay line and this configuration is named as modified RC (MRC). By adding an observer with MRC, system states can be reconstructed, which improve the system dynamic response. Robust stability and convergence criterion are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality using combined Lyapunov function and singular value decomposition technique, which determine the suitable parameters of feedback control and state observer gains. By utilizing these gains, the switching signals are generated to operate the DG interfacing inverter effectively. The performance of proposed controller is compared with traditional proportional integral, proportional resonant, and MRC under both normal and fault conditions.

In a real-life decision-making situation, decision makers express their opinions often linguistically. Such linguistic expressions are then captured by fuzzy set theory and represented in the present study by heptagonal fuzzy numbers for analytic purpose. Firstly, the concept, the arithmetic operations and a centroid-based ranking method of symmetric heptagonal fuzzy numbers (symHFN) are introduced, and then, some operators are proposed for aggregating the linguistic information. Secondly, the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method used for group decision making is extended within the context of the proposed symHFNs to develop an algorithm for fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (FMCGDM) method. The proposed method incorporates an efficient computational technique which handles the degree of satisfaction of the decision maker in their judgement. SymHFNs are used to handle the linguistic evaluation and assessment of alternatives by the decision makers. As it records the primary and secondary degree of satisfaction of decision makers’ opinion, symHFN is more suitable and realistic in decision-making problems.

In many scenarios, the nodes attempt at local decision making based on greedy approaches, which can result in getting trapped at local optimum. Moreover, for efficient routing, the nodes often collect and exchange a lot of information about others. To alleviate such issues, we present SeeR, a simulated annealing-based routing protocol for OMNs. In SeeR, each message is associated with a cost function, which is evaluated by considering its current hop-count and the average aggregated inter-contact time of the node. A node replicates a message to another node, when the latter offers a lower cost. Otherwise, the message is replicated with decreasing probability. Moreover, SeeR works based solely upon local observations. In particular, a node does not track information about other nodes, and, therefore, reduces the risk of privacy leaks unlike many other protocols. We evaluated the performance of SeeR by considering several real-life traces under plausible conditions. Experimental results show that, in the best case, SeeR can reduce the average message delivery latency by about 58 percent, when compared to other popular routing protocols. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Opportunistic mobile networks; privacy; routing; simulated annealing","Cost functions; Data privacy; Decision making; Mobile telecommunication systems; Routing protocols; Simulated annealing; Wireless networks; Efficient routing; Greedy approaches; Intermittent connectivity; Local decision-making; Local observations; Local optima; Message delivery; routing; Network routing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361233,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Delhi area has the highest teledensity in India. The present study uses a fuzzy ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) approach to compare the performance of cellular mobile telephone service providers. The data for the analysis have been taken from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), April–June 2015. Most of the data vary from one month to another. Therefore, these small ranges of variation in the data are incorporated in this study using the fuzzy number. Total six major telecom service providers are considered in this analysis. The findings of the study suggest that the performances of Airtel and Reliance communications are in the first rank; Vodafone and Idea are in the second rank; Aircel is in the third rank, and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) is outranked by all the other service providers. The performance is analyzed on the basis of three major parameters consisting six criteria, i.e. network availability (Base Transceiver Station accumulated downtime), connection accessibility (call setup success rate, channel congestion, and traffic channel congestion), and connection retainability (call drop rate and connection with good voice quality). It has been observed that MTNL is outranked due to the highest traffic channel congestion and highest call drop rate. Using this framework, a decision maker can develop a strategy to improve the performance by benchmarking operational parameters. The research analysis is limited to only GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) service providers in the Delhi working area, including Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, and Gurgaon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular mobile telephone service provider; ELECTRE; Fuzzy logic; Outranking; Performance measurement","Benchmarking; Cellular telephones; Decision making; Drops; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio transceivers; Telephone sets; Base transceiver station; Cellular mobile; Electre; Operational parameters; Operational performance; Outranking; Performance measurements; Telecom service providers; Cellular telephone systems","Kumar, P.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Delhi Technological UniversityIndia; email: pravin.dce@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

In this context, the problem of decision making in the presence of possibly negative attributes is studied. This solution introduces the following two innovations: First, a fuzzy complement enables the information to be uniform when there are attributes that the decision maker regards as negative. Such a possibility defines the new notion of sensitivity of decision making procedures for fuzzy soft sets to the choice of a fuzzy complement. Our sensitivity concept introduces a new criterion to discriminate among decision making procedures for fuzzy soft sets. Secondly, an aggregation process by parameter classes produce a resultant fuzzy soft set. The mechanism that decides among the alternatives in this resultant fuzzy soft set rests on scores computed from a relative comparison matrix. In this way, we obtain an adjustable solution to the problem of decision making for separable fuzzy soft sets. This flexible novel procedure achieves a high power of discrimination and produces a well-determined optimal alternative.

As a result, a signature model composed of a set of interval values (corresponding to the number of features) is obtained for each individual's handwritten signature class. A novel fuzzy similarity measure is further proposed to compute the similarity between a test sample signature and the corresponding interval-valued symbolic model for the verification of the test sample.

VoIP applications depend upon various speech codecs which vary in speech quality, bandwidth and computational requirements. The key challenges for improving the VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) is to use best codec by considering network traffic and selecting the optimal hardware. Hardware Calibration is a mechanism to aid service providers by selecting a suitable hardware for Call Manager to transmit different real-time based applications. The paper focuses on proposing a computational model which suggests the most suitable hardware for a specific load handling requirement. The selection of processor is done by taking into consideration the effect of different codecs when it takes calls per second as input and gives output as whichever hardware is recommended for Call Manager to handle different types of applications like Peer-To-Peer (P2P) application, Back-To-Back (BTB) application, enabling voice logging, etc. The emulations demonstrate that the proposed model is suitable for selection of hardware which provides better QoS and QoE for the transmission VoIP based real-time applications. Further, a multi-criteria decision-making method based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is also proposed to decide which hardware can be chosen as Call Manager. The results obtained from AHP are used to validate the outcome of the proposed computational model. The computational model is applicable only when the tests are run on particular systems and it suggests the best hardware among them for the particular offered load. However, to suggest the best configuration corresponding to the input load from the possible configurations available in the market, benchmarking is performed.

Even though variety of modulation strategies are available only a handful of them are both, simple to be easily implemented by programmable computers and capable to provide satisfactory performance. A novel concept, which is comparatively simple and effective, has been presented here to extend most of the two level inverter modulation strategies to control any levels of series connected inverters. This is achieved by utilizing the concept of de-multiplexing based on threshold detection of the modulating signal. In order to demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method, delta modulation strategy has been used to generate switching signals. The switching signals are then used to control a five-level and seven-level series connected inverter by employing the proposed method. Performance of these inverters has been analyzed through simulation. The results obtained indicate a significant reduction of total harmonic distortion in output voltage and current.

Multimodal medical image fusion combines the images obtained from different modalities like Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and others. CT scan provides detailed information on bony structures whereas MRI scan provides details on soft tissues. Fusion of these images is useful for doctors to diagnose and plan treatment for patients. Various methods have been proposed during recent years for medical image fusion but these methods suffer from the issue of fusion performance due to different sensor modalities. In this paper, we validate that for such images, fusion performance can be improved using a learning based fusion scheme which uses training and testing phase by considering pixel wise processing of image. In order to improve image fusion performance, here we implement fuzzy logic type-2 based approaches for medical image fusion for CT and MRI images. Final fused image is achieved by applying rule based method which includes fuzzification inference, type reduction, and defuzzification of the input image. Experiments are conducted by applying fuzzy logic type-1, neural network, Neuro-fuzzy approach and fuzzy logic type-2 based fusion scheme. Performance of image fusion based on Fuzzy Logic Type-2 is compared with other state-of-art techniques using various performance metrics such as Mutual information, standard deviation and edge based similarity.

Initially, a non-linear homogeneous sliding manifold is designed to achieve finite-time convergence, better robustness, and good transient characteristics. Afterwards, conventional STC is modified with the new sliding surface that eliminates the limitation of STC application only on relative degree 1 systems. Moreover, two adaptive fuzzy systems are designed to replace the STC signals for handling the chattering problem and overestimating the controller gains. These fuzzy systems are continuously adjusted by two adaptation laws that are deduced from the Lyapunov stability theory. These adaptive laws need only a sliding surface variable as an input and generate the optimal controller gains as an output. The finite-time convergence and stability of the proposed controller is analyzed by the homogeneous Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, to show the efficacy of the proposed method, the controller is simulated on a 2-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulator to obtain the accurate trajectory tracking.

Hybrid energy-efficient distributed (HEED) protocol is one of the prominent clustering protocol in WSNs. However, it has few shortcomings, i.e., cluster heads (CHs) variation in consecutive rounds, more work load on CHs, uneven energy dissipation by sensor nodes, and formation of hot spots in network. By resolving these issues, one can enhance HEED capabilities to a greater extent. We have designed variants of Optimized HEED (OHEED) protocols named as HEED-1 Tier chaining (HEED1TC), HEED-2 Tier chaining (HEED2TC), ICHB-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICOH1TC), ICHB-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICOH2TC), ICHB-FL-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICFLOH1TC), and ICHB-FL-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICFLOH2TC) protocols. In HEED1TC and HEED2TC protocols, we have used chain-based intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication in HEED, respectively, for even load balancing among sensor nodes and to avoid more work load on CHs. Furthermore, for appropriate cluster formation, minimizing CHs variation in consecutive rounds and reducing complex uncertainties, we have used bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA)-inspired proposed intelligent CH selection based on BFOA (ICHB) algorithm for CH selection in ICOH1TC and ICOH2TC protocols. Likewise, in ICFLOH1TC and ICFLOH2TC protocols, we have used novel fuzzy set of rules additionally for CH selection to resolve the hot spots problem, proper CH selection covering whole network, and maximizing the network lifetime to a great extent. The simulation results showed that proposed OHEED protocols are able to handle above-discussed issues and provided far better results in comparison to HEED. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany","Bacterial foraging optimization algorithm; Clustering; Fuzzy logic system; HEED; Load balancing; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks","Computer circuits; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Fuzzy logic; High energy electron diffraction; Optimization; Resource allocation; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Bacterial foraging optimization; Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA); Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Clustering; Fuzzy logic system; Intercluster communication; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Clustering algorithms","Gupta, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: cseprateek@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029597015

In clustered WSNs, network is partitioned into set of clusters, each having a coordinator called cluster head (CH), which collects data from its cluster members and forwards it to the base station (BS) via other CHs. Clustered WSNs often suffer from the hot spot problem where CHs closer to the BS die much early because of high energy consumption contributed by the data forwarding load. Such death of nodes results coverage holes in the network very early. In most applications of WSNs, coverage preservation of the target area is a primary measure of quality of service. Considering the energy limitation of sensors, most of the clustering algorithms designed for WSNs focus on energy efficiency while ignoring the coverage requirement. In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm that uses fuzzy logic to establish a trade-off between the energy efficiency and coverage requirement. This algorithm considers both energy and coverage parameters during cluster formation to maximize the coverage preservation of target area. Further, to deal with hot spot problem, it forms unequal sized clusters such that more CHs are available closer to BS to share the high data forwarding load.

The nodes in the network are resource constrained in nature and faces several challenges for producing the data from the unfriendly environment. Large amount of data is generated from WSN and suffers from data fault, inaccuracy and inconsistency. To increase the reliability of application, several data trust management schemes are introduced to ensure the trustworthiness of data in decision making process. Apart from these schemes, in the absence of ground truth, sensor data models are used to find the trustiness of the sensor data. The data generated from the simulation of data model is used as a metric to evaluate the degree of trustiness of sensor data. The existing sensor data models suffer from high energy consumption for data trustiness detection and it becomes inaccurate when the data fault rate is high. In this paper, we are proposing an energy efficient sensor data model for evaluating the sensor data trustworthiness and reconstruct the sensor data in case of any data loss and data fault. The proposed data model is hybrid in nature and it works at low level sensor nodes and also at sink node. Results show that the proposed data model is able to detect the untrustworthy data and gives remedy to untrustworthy and missing data with the help of data reconstruction in an energy efficient way and it is able to identify the events in reliable fashion. © 2017 IEEE.","Data Models; Data Reconstruction; Data Trustworthiness; Wireless sensor networks","Big data; Data privacy; Data structures; Decision making; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network security; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Data reconstruction; Data Trustworthiness; Decision making process; Environmental parameter; High energy consumption; Sensor data modeling; Sensor data models; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Data communication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049059,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The multi-feature fuzzy aggregation used in that approach uses real fuzzy similarity values, and is robust for low and medium-scale dynamic background conditions such as swaying vegetation, sprinkling water, etc. The technique, however, exhibited some limitations under heavily dynamic background conditions, as features have high uncertainty under such noisy conditions and these uncertainties were not captured by real fuzzy similarity values. Our proposed algorithm is particularly focused toward improving the detection under heavy dynamic background conditions by modeling uncertainties in the data by interval-valued fuzzy set. In this paper, real-valued fuzzy aggregation has been extended to interval-valued fuzzy aggregation by considering uncertainties over real similarity values. We build up a procedure to calculate the uncertainty that varies for each feature, at each pixel, and at each time instant. We adaptively determine membership values at each pixel by the Gaussian of uncertainty value instead of fixed membership values used in recent fuzzy approaches, thereby, giving importance to a feature based on its uncertainty. Interval-valued Choquet integral is evaluated using interval similarity values and the membership values in order to calculate interval-valued fuzzy similarity between model and current. Adequate qualitative and quantitative studies are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating heavily dynamic background situations as compared to state-of-the-art. © 2013 IEEE.","Fuzzy statistical texture (FST) features; interval-valued Choquet fuzzy integral; interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS); interval-valued fuzzy similarity; moving object detection; uncertainty","Fuzzy logic; Integral equations; Pixels; Background subtraction; Dynamic background; Fuzzy aggregation; Interval-valued fuzzy sets; Membership values; Model uncertainties; Noisy conditions; Quantitative study; Uncertainty analysis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21682267,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Each individual QE term selection method has its weaknesses and strengths. To overcome the weaknesses and to utilize the strengths of the individual method, we used multiple terms selection methods together. In this paper, we present a new method for QE based on fuzzy logic considering the top-retrieved document as relevance feedback documents for mining additional QE terms. Different QE terms selection methods calculate the degrees of importance of all unique terms of top-retrieved documents collection for mining additional expansion terms. These methods give different relevance scores for each term. The proposed method combines different weights of each term by using fuzzy rules to infer the weights of the additional query terms. Then, the weights of the additional query terms and the weights of the original query terms are used to form the new query vector, and we use this new query vector to retrieve documents. All the experiments are performed on TREC and FIRE benchmark datasets. The proposed QE method increases the precision rates and the recall rates of information retrieval systems for dealing with document retrieval.

At the starting condition, the current is too high due to the absence of back EMF and therefore the motor will start with high torque ripples.

The major source of information is databases. Databases and its technology are having major impact on the highly developing use of computers. To retrieve information from a database, we need to formulate a query in such a way that the computer can understand and produce the necessary output that users required. The SQL norms are been pursued in almost all languages for RDBMS systems. Everybody can not able to write SQL queries that they may not be aware of the structure of database. So there may be a need for users whom were non-expert to query relational databases in their natural language not working with the values of the attributes. This idea of using natural language instead of SQL, has promoted the development for Natural Language Interface to the Database systems. The need of Natural Language Interface to the Database systems is increasing day by day as many more people access information through web browsers, Personal Digital Assistance and cell phones. This paper introduces an intelligent interface for the database. This theory proves that our Natural Language Interface to the Database systems are guaranteed to map a natural language query to corresponding SQL query. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Soil classification aids farmers in deciding the type of crop to be sown for a particular type of soil. Similarly, wheat variety classification assists in selecting the right type of wheat for a particular product. Current methods used for classifying agricultural data are mostly manual. These methods involve agriculture field visits and surveys and are labor-intensive, expensive, and prone to human error. Recently, data mining techniques such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) have been used in classification of agricultural data such as soil, crops, and land cover. The resulting classification aid the decision making process of government organizations and agro-industries in the field of agriculture. SVM is a popular approach for data classification. A recent study on SVM highlighted the fact that using multiple kernels instead of a single kernel would lead to better performance because of the greater learning and generalization power. In this work, a hybrid kernel based support vector machine (H-SVM) is proposed for classifying multi-class agricultural datasets having continuous attributes. Genetic algorithm (GA) or gradient descent (GD) methods are utilized to select the SVM parameters C and γ. The proposed kernel is called the quadratic-radial-basis-function kernel (QRK) and it combines both quadratic and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The proposed classifier has the ability to classify all kinds of multi-class agricultural datasets with continuous features. Rigorous experiments using the proposed method are performed on standard benchmark and real world agriculture datasets. The results reveal a significant performance improvement over state of the art methods such as NB, k-NN, and SVM in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Classification; Hybrid; Kernels; SVM","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Crops; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Radial basis function networks; Soils; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Continuous attribute; Decision making process; Government organizations; Hybrid; Kernels; Radial basis function kernels; Radial Basis Function(RBF); State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information)","Shastry, K.A.email: adityashastry.k@nmit.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

In MANET, application security can be provided using trust management, key management, firewalls and intrusion detection. Moreover, it is often necessary to communicate secret information in military applications where urgent and reliable communication is more important. However, most of the existing routing algorithms do not focus on the energy and security aspects while routing. Since energy and security are important criteria for reliable communication in MANET, it is essential to consider the energy and security aspects in routing algorithms. The prevention of security attacks on routing protocols and cluster based routing automatically reduces the energy consumption. Hence, we propose a new secured routing protocol called Cluster based Energy Efficient Secure Routing Algorithm (CEESRA) in this paper which is energy efficient and uses cluster based routing in which the trust scores on nodes are used to detect the intruders effectively. This routing algorithm reduces the Denial of Service attacks more efficiently by using intelligent agents for effective decision making in routing. From the experiments conducted with this trust based secured routing algorithm, it has been observed that this proposed routing algorithm not only enhances the security but also reduces the energy consumption and routing delay. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficiency; Intrusion detection; Malicious nodes; Mobile Ad Hoc networks; Secure routing; Trust score","Clustering algorithms; Computer viruses; Decision making; Denial-of-service attack; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent agents; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Military applications; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Application security; Cluster-based routing; Energy efficient routing; Malicious nodes; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Reliable communication; Secure routing; Trust scores; Mobile security","Muthurajkumar, S.; Department of Information Science and Technology, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna UniversityIndia; email: muthurajkumarss@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018255074

This paper presents a novel, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-trained Quantile Regression Neural Network namely PSOQRNN, to forecast volatility from financial time series. We compared the effectiveness of PSOQRNN with that of the traditional volatility forecasting models, i.e., Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and three Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Random Forest (RF) and two Quantile Regression (QR)-based hybrids including Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) and Quantile Regression Random Forest (QRRF). The results indicate that the proposed PSOQRNN outperformed these models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), on a majority of the eight financial time series including exchange rates of USD versus JPY, GBP, EUR and INR, Gold Price, Crude Oil Price, Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) Stock Index and NSE India Stock Index considered here. It was corroborated by the Diebold–Mariano test of statistical significance. It also performed well in terms of other important measures such as Directional Change Statistic (Dstat) and Theil's Inequality Coefficient. The superior performance of PSOQRNN can be attributed to the role played by PSO in obtaining the better solutions.

Underground coal mining industry uses different machinery such as shearers, crushers, continuous miners, Armoured Face Conveyor (AFC) etc. which are sensitive to voltage fluctuations. Machines used are induction motors which are rated high because high torque is required for cutting of coal. These motors are sensitive to voltage fluctuations as torque is proportional to square of the voltage. Generally, mining industries are located in remote areas and in underground mines, transformers are not allowed inside the mines for safety purposes and hence cables are used in underground mines for transmission of power. The value of voltages goes on reducing with increasing depth of the mines, and it becomes critical. Voltage sag is one of the common and serious issue to the mining industry. In order to maintain constant voltage, there should be some compensating devices to compensate voltage sag. In order to solve voltage sag problem, one of the underground mine is considered for case studies. This paper focused on improvement of power quality by using Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM), with three controllers such as Proportional Integral (PI) controller, Hysteresis Voltage Controller and Fuzzy Logic Controller. These controllers are implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK software and a comparative analysis is presented based on the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) with and without controllers. © 2017 AMSE Press.

This essentially leads to increase in profit to a manufacturing unit. Re-production of products usually depends on the various facts including consumption in the market, reviewer’s comments, ratings, etc. However, knowing consumer preference for decision making and behavior prediction for effective utilization of a product using unconscious processes is called “Neuromarketing”. This field is emerging fast due to its inherent potential. Therefore, research work in this direction is highly demanded, yet not reached a satisfactory level. In this paper, we propose a predictive modeling framework to understand consumer choice towards E-commerce products in terms of “likes” and “dislikes” by analyzing EEG signals. The EEG signals of volunteers with varying age and gender were recorded while they browsed through various consumer products. The experiments were performed on the dataset comprised of various consumer products.

Quality of video streaming primarily depends on factors including: device’s features, available bandwidth, and video codec. Existing video streaming techniques do not provide smooth streaming since the streaming quality depends only on estimating the available bandwidth ignoring the device’s static and dynamic features. This research work concentrates on hybrid features of device, i.e. static and dynamic features and also the network features for enhancing video streaming quality. This is achieved by using the following three components (Tristate): Static grade point calculator, energy manager and hybrid bandwidth estimator for estimating quality states respectively. Using the statistical features extracted from the three components, the state machine decision maker with novel ensemble-based adaptive learning algorithm decides on the quality of the video to be streamed. Main objective of this work is to provide scalable, robust video streaming with the services of Tristate components and the development of a novel ensemble-based adaptive learning algorithm to achieve quality of service. This proposed technique is tested with cloud open stack platform under various network conditions like motion, driving and train. The experimental results are compared with those of the existing techniques and the results indicate that the proposed work outperforms other schemes in terms of metrics like PSNR, Bandwidth Estimation, and Smoothness in streaming, Power Consumption Rate, Freeze time and computational time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bandwidth estimator; Cloud computing; Energy manager; Quality of service; State decision maker; Video streaming","Bandwidth; Cloud computing; Decision making; Estimation; Machine components; Managers; Quality of service; Video streaming; Adaptive learning algorithm; Available bandwidth; Bandwidth estimation; Bandwidth estimators; Decision makers; Energy managers; Power consumption rates; Statistical features; Learning algorithms","Kesavaraja, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr. Sivanthi Aditanar College of EngineeringIndia; email: dkesavraj@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019577432

In this paper, we utilize the conception of Jensen–Shannon divergence to propose new measures called Jensen-exponential divergence for measuring the discrimination between intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and demonstrate some very elegant properties, which show its strength for applications point of view. Next, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem for IFSs that describes information about options with respect to criteria is studied. A technique that employs the relative comparisons for IFSs (that uses all the constraints, viz. membership, non-membership and hesitancy degrees) based on the advantage and disadvantage scores of the options with respect to criterion, where criterion weights are completely unknown, is used. In addition, the score functions are applied to evaluate the strength and worst scores leading to the satisfaction degree of the options. A multi-objective optimization model for optimal weights of the criterion that maximizes the satisfaction degree of each option is constructed. Energy resources play an important role in the social and economic development of the countries. Due to the industrialization, population growth and urbanization, the demand of energy is increasing gradually and this requires the selection of most suitable energy resource for economic development of the countries. The proposed MCDM method is presented to choose the most appropriate energy alternative among set of renewable energy alternatives. In this real case study, the decision makers provide their opinions in terms of linguistic variables because it is tricky to portray exact numerical values during the evaluation of energy alternatives. Finally, a comprehensive comparison is prepared to express the effectiveness of the technique over the existing techniques for the IF MCDM problems. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Divergence measure; Entropy; Fuzzy set; Intuitionistic fuzzy set; Jensen–Shannon divergence; MCDM","Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Energy resources; Entropy; Fuzzy sets; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Population statistics; Divergence measures; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; MCDM; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Multi-objective optimization models; Shannon; Social and economic development; Decision making","Mishra, A.R.; Department of Mathematics, ITM UniversityIndia; email: arunodayaraj.math@itmuniversity.ac.in",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

Due to the human involvement, web usage data usually contain noisy, incomplete and vague information. Neural networks have the capability to extract embedded knowledge in the form of user session clusters from the huge web usage data. Moreover, they provide tolerance against imperfect and noisy data. Fuzzy sets are another popular tool utilized for handling uncertainty and vagueness hidden in the data. In this paper a fuzzy neural clustering network (FNCN) based framework is proposed that makes use of the fuzzy membership concept of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and the learning rate of a modified self-organizing map (MSOM) neural network model and tries to minimize the weighted sum of the squared error. FNCN is applied to cluster the users’ web access data extracted from the web logs of an educational institution’s proxy web server. The performance of FNCN is compared with FCM and MSOM based clustering methods using various validity indexes. Our results show that FNCN produces better quality of clusters than FCM and MSOM. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fuzzy cluster validity; Fuzzy neural clustering; Self organizing map; Web usage analysis","Conformal mapping; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Self organizing maps; Cluster validity; Educational institutions; Fuzzy C means clustering; Fuzzy membership; Fuzzy-neural; Neural network model; User access patterns; Web usage analysis; Fuzzy logic","Ansari, Z.A.; P.A.

Engineering design is often carried out under competition from other designers or firms, where each competitor invests effort with the hope of getting a contract, attracting customers, or winning a prize. One such scenario of design under competition is crowdsourcing where designers compete for monetary prizes. Within existing literature, such competitive scenarios have been studied using models from contest theory, which are based on assumptions of rationality and equilibrium. Although these models are general enough for different types of contests, they do not address the unique characteristics of design decision-making, e.g., strategies related to the design process, the sequential nature of design decisions, the evolution of strategies, and heterogeneity among designers. In this paper, we address these gaps by developing an analytical model for design under competition, and using it in conjunction with a behavioral experiment to gain insights about how individuals actually make decisions in such scenarios. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, a game-theoretic model is presented for sequential design decisions considering the decisions made by other players. Second, an approach for synergistic integration of analytical models with data from behavioral experiments is presented. The proposed approach provides insights such as shift in participants' strategies from exploration to exploitation as they acquire more information, and how they develop beliefs about the quality of their opponents' solutions. © 2017 by ASME.","Behavioral experiments; Competition; Crowdsourcing; Decision-making; Game theory; Information acquisition","Analytical models; Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Competition; Crowdsourcing; Decision making; Decision theory; Game theory; Behavioral experiment; Decision making in design; Design decision-making; Engineering design; Game-theoretic model; Information acquisitions; Sequential design; Synergistic integration; Design","Panchal, J.H.; School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue UniversityIndia; email: panchal@purdue.edu",,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)",10500472,,JMDEE,,"English","J Mech Des, Trans ASME",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026288604

Most of these state-of-art algorithms have been developed from the concept of multi-layered artificial neural networks. Large amount of numerical and linguistic rule data has been created in recent years. Fuzzy sets are useful in modeling uncertainty due to vagueness, ambiguity and imprecision. Fuzzy inference systems incorporate linguistic rules intelligible to human beings. Many attempts have been made to combine assets of fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems and artificial neural networks. Use of a single fuzzy inference system limits the performance. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture of multi-layered network developed from Takagi Sugeno fuzzy inference systems as basic units. This generic architecture is called 'Takagi Sugeno Deep Fuzzy Network'. Multiple distinct fuzzy inference structures can be identified using proposed architecture. A general three layered TS deep fuzzy network is explained in detail in this paper. The generic algorithm for identification of all network parameters of three layered deep fuzzy network using error backpropagation is presented in the paper. The proposed architecture as well as its identification procedure are validated using two experimental case studies. The performance of proposed architecture is evaluated in normal, imprecise and vague situations and it is compared with performance of artificial neural network with same architecture. The results illustrate that the proposed architecture eclipses over three layered feedforward artificial neural network in all situations. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Backpropagation algorithms; Computer programming; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Linguistics; Network layers; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Uncertainty analysis; Error back-propagation; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; Fuzzy inference systems; Generic architecture; Identification procedure; Model uncertainties; Proposed architectures; Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference systems; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10987584,9781509060344,PIFSF,,"English","IEEE Int Conf Fuzzy Syst",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030179087

We utilize the Karnik-Mendel (KM) algorithm to estimate the centroid boundary of a multi-dimensional footprint of uncertainty (FOU). We deal with two-dimensional (2-D) fuzzy sets as we can visualize the FOU using 3-D plots, thus making the illustration of the methods simple. However, the basic idea can be extended to multiple dimensions. We give a formal definition of the centroid boundary of a 2-D IT2 fuzzy membership function (FMF) and propose two methods for its estimation. The first method computes embedded type-1 (T1) FSs whose centroids constitute the centroid boundary. We obtain the embedded sets by producing slices of the domain using different sets of parallel planes and then apply the KM algorithm over each slice, to obtain 'embedded-curves.' For the second method, we approximate our first method by restricting embedded-curves to be 'embedded-lines' thus enhancing computational speed. These type reduction techniques can be applied to applications involving multi-dimensional centroid estimation such as, clustering, support vector estimation for dimensionality reduction, fuzzy logic controllers, to mention a few. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computation theory; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Membership functions; Uncertainty analysis; Computational speed; Dimensionality reduction; Footprint of uncertainties; Fuzzy logic controllers; Fuzzy membership function; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Multiple dimensions; Two Dimensional (2 D); Fuzzy logic",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10987584,9781509060344,PIFSF,,"English","IEEE Int Conf Fuzzy Syst",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030160406

The placement prediction is more complex when the complexity of educational entities increase. Educational institutes look for more efficient technology that assist better management and support decision making procedures or assist them to set new strategies. One of the effective ways to address the challenges for improving the quality is to provide new knowledge related to the educational processes and entities to the managerial system. With the machine learning techniques the knowledge can be extracted from operational and historical data that resides within the educational organization's databases using. The dataset for system implementation contains information about past data of students. These data are used for training the model for rule identification and for testing the model for classification. This paper presents a recommendation system that predicts the students to have one of the five placement statuses, viz., Dream Company, Core Company, Mass Recruiters, Not Eligible and Not Interested in Placements. This model helps the placement cell within an organization to identify the prospective students and pay attention to and improve their technical as well as interpersonal skills. Furthermore, the students in pre-final and final years of their B. Tech course can also use this system to know their individual placement status that they are most likely to achieve.

The proposed method removal of rician noise in MRI images using bilateral filter by fuzzy trapezoidal membership function improves the denoising efficiency at various noise variances, preserves the fine structures and edges. The fuzzy weights were obtained with the statistical features such as local mean (μi) and global mean (μg) by constructing trapezoidal membership function. Bilateral filter is used to preserve the edges by smoothening the noises in MRI image and preserves the structural information. Local filter preserves the edges. MRI images are restored by multiplying its corresponding fuzzy weight with the restored image of local order filter and bilateral filter. Experiments on simulated and real MRI data were done at different noise levels by the proposed method and the existing methods. The result shows that the proposed method restores the image in better visual quality and can be well utilized for diagnostic purpose at both low and high densities of rician noise. © 2017 IEEE.","bilateral filter; denoising; fuzzy logic; magnetic resonance imaging; membership function; rician noise","Bandpass filters; Computation theory; Diagnosis; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy logic; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Membership functions; Neurology; Nonlinear filtering; Restoration; Bilateral filters; Computed-aided diagnosis; De-noising; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Non-local mean filters; rician noise; Structural information; Trapezoidal membership functions; Image denoising",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

However, there are some underlying challenges with implementing the offloading method which hinders its practical applications. The framework of POMAC (Properly Offloading Mobile Applications to Clouds) has been previously utilized for offering transparent and active mobile application by means of cloud offloading. The POMAC framework enables the identification of the decision making features of the pivotal offloading method. This has been done by comparing the performance of various decision making features for subsequent minimization of the energy consumption. In the source code of the application, the clear offloading approach can be designed using the interception method for avoiding the special assembly. However, there is insufficient de-allocation of the allocated resources for applications based on offloading thus retaining the wireless access efficiency problem. This paper deals with the framework of modified POMAC (M-POMAC) for efficient deallocation of the resources for benefiting various other users. The Accelerated Bat (ABAT) algorithm inspired by Tabu search is employed in this M-POMAC method to offer the design of decentralized mechanism for self-organizing the decisions related to offloading applications. The proposed self-organizing scheme enables to give the autonomous status for the system of mobile cloud computing thus helping for easing the complexity of the cloud management method. © 2017 IEEE.","Accelerated bat; Decentralized Offloading; Mobile cloud computing; POMAC; Tabusearch","Cloud computing; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network function virtualization; Tabu search; Accelerated bat; Cloud managements; Decentralized Offloading; Mobile applications; POMAC; Self-organizing scheme; Telecommunication architecture; Wireless access; Mobile cloud computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

Four types of MG-BVF-PRSs are established, by the four different conditional probabilities of BVF event. For different constraints on parameters, we obtain four kinds of each type MG-BVF-PRSs over two universes. To find a suitable way of explaining and determining these parameters in each kind of each type MG-BVF-PRS, three-way decisions (3WDs) are studied based on Bayesian minimum-risk procedure, i.e., the multi-granulation BVF decision-theoretic rough set (MG-BVF-DTRS) approach. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. One is to extend the fuzzy probabilistic rough set (FPRS) to MG-BVF-PRS model over two universes.

In the particular case of a finite distributive lattice, considering the t-norm given by the meet and the t-conorm given by the join, this qualitative measure agrees with the value that some discrete Sugeno integral takes on the vector consisting of all the members of the lattice.

Added to high capacity solar generating units, distribution level solar generation has gained importance and popularity. To effectively implement intelligent systems that feed household generated surplus power to distribution feeder network, modeling and simulation of the grid tied solar system is of high importance. The paper models a 5kW domestic roof top solar grid tie system connected to 230-240 V single phase grid. The work proposes a two level boost topology with an efficient output voltage control system that synchronizes the phase, frequency and voltage of the inverter with the grid. The MPPT DC-DC converter controlled by Incremental Conductance (INCCOND) extracts maximum power while the second level DC-DC converter controls the DC link voltage according to the Grid voltage changes to effectively regulate the inverter output voltage. The developed model has been implemented and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Dynamic grid voltage changes have been imposed to evaluate the performance of the voltage controller and the two level boost converters.

Distributed WSN is used for ambient intelligence, where tiny senor nodes sense, process and communicate signals to the base station (BS) for smart decision making. Nodes are deployed randomly in any unattended area for monitoring any physical attribute of the same; hence faults are quite trivial to take place. Therefore to maintain health of WSN, in-built self evaluation and in-built self recovery, is necessary. In this article various fault recovery techniques are studied and analyzed, which can enlighten us for proposing a novel energy aware fault recovery scheme for homogeneous WSN in future; which further can be integrated with an existent fault tolerant framework already proposed by us. This study also enables to get a clearer picture on the current state of technology for fault recovery in WSN. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed wireless sensor network; Fault; Fault recovery technique; Fault tolerance","Ambient intelligence; Computer system recovery; Decision making; Fault tolerance; Faulting; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Communication technologies; Comparative studies; Distributed wireless sensor networks; Fault recovery; Fault recovery technique; Fault-tolerant; Self evaluation; Self recovery; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037452,,,"English","WIECON-ECE - IEEE Int.

We propose to use fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL) approach for efficient and reliable solution to the unit commitment problem. In particular, we cast UCP as a multiagent fuzzy reinforcement learning task wherein individual generators act as players for optimizing the cost to meet a given load over a twenty-four-hour period. Unit commitment task has been fuzzified, and the most optimal unit commitment solution is generated by employing RL on this fuzzy multigenerator setup. Our proposed multiagent RL framework does not assume any a priori task or system knowledge, and the generators gradually learn to produce most optimal output solely based on their collective generation. We look at the UCP as a sequential decision-making task with reward/penalty to reduce the collective generation cost of generators. To the best of our knowledge, ours is a first attempt at solving UCP by employing fuzzy reinforcement learning. We test our approach on a ten-generating-unit system with several equality and inequality constraints. Simulation results and comparisons against several recent UCP solution methods prove superiority and viability of our proposed multiagent fuzzy reinforcement learning technique. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Economic load dispatch; Fuzzy Q learning; Multiagent fuzzy RL; Unit commitment problem","Constraint theory; Costs; Decision making; Electric load dispatching; Multi agent systems; Economic load dispatch; Fuzzy reinforcement learning; Fuzzy-Q-learning; Multiagent fuzzy RL; Sequential decision making; Thermal unit commitments; Unit commitment problem; Unit commitment problem (UCP); Reinforcement learning","Navin, N.K.; Division of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: nandanknavin@nsit.ac.in",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

The preference relations with triangular fuzzy numbers are in consistent in nature, so we turned to neutrosophic in this paper. It is very important to take into account consistency of expert opinion and consensus degree in GDM. In order to distinguish the typical consistency, the concept of additive approximation consistency is proposed for triangular neutrosophic additive reciprocal matrices. The properties of triangular neutrosophic additive reciprocal matrices with additive approximation consistency are studied in detail. Second, by using (Formula presented.) restricted preference values, a triangular neutrosophic additive reciprocal preference relation with additive approximation consistency is constructed. The differences among expert’s opinions are measured using consensus degree. For generating a collective triangular neutrosophic additive reciprocal matrix with additive approximation consistency, the neutrosophic triangular weighted aggregation operator is used.

In CRN, the cognitive devices sense the spectrum, and transmits, on detecting an available channel. Thus CRN resourcefully utilize the idle spectrum bands. In CRN, the users are classified into two types - Primary users and Secondary users. Secondary users are further classified into two tiers- Real Time users (RT) and Non-Real Time users (NRT). Users from both the tiers share a single channel for transmission, resulting in efficient spectrum usage. However, with ever growing number of secondary mobile users having diverse QoS requirements, the cognitive interactions among them need to be optimized. This paper uses game theory to study the conflict and cooperation among the two tiers of secondary users. An auction game model is proposed that analyzes the complex decision making process and efficiently allocates an idle channel to a pair of RT and NRT secondary users from a pool of users. The game model is further extensively analyzed mathematically, using Markov chain, showing a reduction in user Blocking probability, user Dropping probability, Channel Saturation probability and increase in user Acceptance probability, compared to the Basic One-Tier CRN and Non-Optimized Two-Tier CRN. The optimized network model is then simulated using Qualnet 7.1.

The major advantages of the improved converter as compared with the basic topology are its capability to perform the buck, boost, and buck-boost modes of operation using the same structure and the ability to deliver power to the load even with the failure of any one of the input energy sources. Hence, the detailed software simulation of the improved converter has been performed using MATLAB/Simulink platform. Different analyses have been conducted by considering the parameters, such as the equivalent series resistance of the passive elements in the converter and efficiency of the converter, for better validation of the converter performance.

As energy becomes a quite challenging issue in these networks, clustering protocols are employed to deal with this problem. One of the main research areas in cluster-based routing protocols is fair distribution and balancing the overall energy consumption in the WSN, by selecting the most suitable cluster heads (CHs). In order to reduce the energy consumption and enhancing the CHs selection process a new routing protocol based on fuzzy logic has been proposed. There exist several algorithms based of fuzzy logic to select the most proper CHs for the network. But these algorithms do not consider all the important parameters and information of the sensor nodes in order to guarantee the optimal selection of the CHs. In The proposed algorithm, a two-step fuzzy logic system is used to select the appropriate CHs. The selection of CHs is based on six descriptors; residual energy, density, distance to base station, vulnerability index, centrality and distance between CHs. The result of the simulation indicates that, the proposed algorithm performs better comparing with some other similar approaches in case of fair distribution and balancing of the overall energy consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cluster heads selection; Clustering protocols; Energy; Fuzzy logic; WSNs","Algorithms; Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Reconfigurable hardware; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster head; Clustering protocol; Energy; Resource restrictions; Vulnerability index; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Fuzzy logic","Tamandani, Y.K.; Department of Computer Science, Aligarh Muslim UniversityIndia; email: Yahya.kord@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964008632

In WSNs, geographic adaptive fidelity (GAF) is one of the most energy efficient location based protocol which extends the network lifetime by identifying equivalence between sensors using geographic location information and then keeping unnecessary sensors in sleep state, while maintaining application fidelity. Still traditional GAF cannot reach to the optimum energy usage since it needs more hop count to transmit data packets to the base station called sink. As a result, it leads to higher energy usage and packet delay due to participation of more sensors. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based topology management protocol named FTGAF-HEX, which bases on GAF is proposed to achieve minimum packet delay with higher energy conservation. Furthermore, we propose to use a generalized version of GAF based on honeycomb virtual grid architecture called Hexagonal GAF (GAF-HEX) to replace the square grid with hexagonal one. Analysis and simulation results show significant improvement of the proposed work compared to traditional GAF in the aspect of various performance metrics i.e., total hop count, energy consumption and distance covered by the data packet before reaching the sink. As a result, compared to traditional GAF-HEX, it needs 37–44% less hop count and consumes 17–24% less energy to prolong the network lifetime. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Internet protocols; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Geographic adaptive fidelities; Geographic location; Geographic routing protocols; Location-based protocols; Performance metrics; Topology management; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Power management (telecommunication)","Soni, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology MesraIndia; email: vaibsoni@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",09467076,,,,"English","Microsyst Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010723247

Cloud computing has made great impact on the information technology industries but still it faces lots of challenges like mobility in devices, load balancing, energy consumption, security and performance of cloud etc. Future prospect of cloud computing convinced and motivated us to do research on cloud computing framework which uses cloudlet as a service provider. So in the existing framework for mobile cloudlet center, we find three main problems. First problem is that the existing framework does not have concrete mechanism to consider the feedback given to the cloudlet for the task they performed for various other mobile devices. Second problem is that there is no method or framework available which can fetch dynamic parameter of mobile devices and manipulate the information for evaluation of the performance of cloudlets and potential mobile devices which applies to work as cloudlet. Third and the last problem says that there is no measure by which root server can decide whether to scale up or scale down the cloud–cloudlet system. In the proposed model, we have considered the feedback sent by the mobile device and stored it in a directory maintained by the root server at cloud. The root server refers this directory while allocating the task to cloudlets. For the second problem we have used the Gabriel architecture and crowd sensing framework collectively. The combination of these two quite efficiently processes the sensed information at the local level and passes the processed information to root server for decision making. For the last problem we have proposed metrics of yield factor for various parameters which will be calculated by the root server and based on those yield factor values root server can decide whether to scale up the cloud–cloudlet system or not. The proposed scalable key-parameter yield of resources model executed all three solutions on Cloudsim simulator and the results for various parameters are compared with the existing framework of mobile cloudlet center system. These comparisons clearly depict the better performance of our proposed scalable key-parameter yield of resources model over existing framework. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud architecture; Cloud–cloudlet system; Framework of mobile cloudlet center; Gabriel architecture; Local computation; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile crowd sensing system; Scalable key parameter yield of resources model; Sensor based data collection","Architecture; Cloud computing; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Feedback; Mobile devices; Parameter estimation; Ubiquitous computing; Cloud architectures; Framework of mobile cloudlet center; Local computation; Sensing systems; Sensor based data; Mobile cloud computing","Kumar, R.; Department of CSE, NITTTRIndia; email: raakeshdhiman@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011706174

Hence, the early detection of cardiac diseases based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is important for delivering appropriate and timely treatment to the heart patients and it is increasing the heart patient’s survival. Recent trends in clinical decision making systems appeal automation in ECG signal processing and beat classification. Automatic beat classification is a significant method to support clinical specialists to categorize arrhythmia signals in ECG recording. The main objective of this paper is to construct novel automatic classification system for analysis of ECG signal and decision making purposes. The proposed method involves three main parts: De-noising, feature extraction and classification. Initially, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied before classification for signal De-noising and feature extraction. In this work, neighborhood rough set is applied to classify the ECG signals into normal and four abnormal heart beats. The presence of neighborhood rough set classification algorithm (NRSC) produces very exciting recognition and classification abilities through a wide range of biomedical signal processing. The experimental analysis of the proposed NRSC algorithm is compared with the multi-layered perceptron, decision table, Naïve Bayes and J48 classification algorithms. Here, the performance of classification algorithms has been evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false predictive value, Matthews’s correlation coefficients, F-measure, Folke–Mallows Index and Kulcznski Index. The acquired results showed that the proposed algorithm attained 99.32 % of the classification accuracy using NRSC and DWT. Results indicated that the performance of this proposed NRSC classification method was remarkably superior to that of other classification techniques. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cardiac Diseases; Discrete wavelet transform; ECG signal classification; Neighborhood rough set; Rough set","Algorithms; Audio systems; Automatic indexing; Bioinformatics; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Decision making; Decision tables; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Heart; Patient treatment; Rough set theory; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Automatic classification systems; Cardiac disease; Classification algorithm; ECG signals; Feature extraction and classification; Negative predictive value; Neighborhood rough sets; Positive predictive values; Biomedical signal processing","Kumar, S.U.; Department of computer science, Periyar UniversityIndia; email: uk2804@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959134002

In every stage of supply chain, the cost and delivery time are involved. These criteria are uncertain in nature. We express these criteria in either the triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. While optimizing the time and cost simultaneously, the problem becomes bi-objective. Such problems can be solved by using Multiple Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). We get the different Pareto front at different α-cuts which is called as the Pareto decision space. According to the uncertainty in the market, decision maker has a choice to take decision among the set of alternatives. Here, the proposed solution methodology is fusion of fuzzy set theory and MOGA.

Image denoising as a preprocessing step is needed for extracting features and accurate object recognition. Adaptive filters are preferred because traditional techniques often result in excess smoothing and fail to preserve edges while removing noise. A fuzzy-based image denoising algorithm is proposed to retain edge information and as well remove noise for restoration of underwater images. The adaptive nature of the proposed algorithm was tested using varying degrees of Gaussian noise.

The designed control law works on basis of indirect T–S fuzzy control and utilizes two online approximations which allowed instantaneous insertion of finding gains of delayed state uncertainties. The benefit of employing a T–S fuzzy system is utilize of analytical results which are linear instead of approximating functions of nonlinear system with online update laws. The T–S fuzzy tracking control utilizes variable structure control method to resolve the system uncertainties, time-delayed uncertainty, and the external disturbances such that H∞ tracking performance is achieved. The control rules are derived based on a Lyapunov criterion and the Riccati inequality such that all states of the system are uniformly ultimately limited.

Drawback of AODV is, it does not support larger networks. DYMO supports both medium and larger networks. To enhance the performance of DYMO, this paper proposes FBNTT DYMO by applying dynamic Node Traversal Time (NTT) in place of defacto NTT using fuzzy logic and Matlab. Fuzzy concept is used by taking network size and mobility is inputs and NTT as output. NTT plays a vital role in improving QoS in MANETs. For the Existing DYMO the default NTT value is 90 ms in QualNet simulator, however in a lively and dynamic environment we should not depend on the static values during protocol configuration.

The availability of the milling system is influenced by poor controls and faults occurring inside the mills.

In this paper, a model-based residual evaluation approach, which is capable of online fault detection and diagnosis of major faults occurring in the milling system, is proposed. A dynamic mathematical model of mill, which can authentically replicate the mill behavior under different conditions, is selected for residual generation. Fuzzy logic is employed for residual evaluation to determine the type and magnitude of the fault, while Bayesian network is used for troubleshooting the root cause. The proposed technique is validated using historical data of coal mills obtained from an actual coal-fired power plant in India. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach has potential to provide useful information regarding the condition of the mills and can help operators to take appropriate control action timely.

In this paper, we used the idea of Jensen–Shannon divergence to define a new divergence measure called ‘fuzzy Jensen-exponential divergence (FJSD)’ for measuring the discrimination/difference between two fuzzy sets. The measure is demonstrated to satisfy some very elegant properties, which shows its strength for applications in multi-criteria decision-making problems. Further, we develop a method to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems under fuzzy phenomenon by utilizing the proposed measure and demonstrate by a numerical example. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Entropy; Fuzzy divergence; Fuzzy sets; Jensen–Shannon divergence; Multi-criteria decision making","Entropy; Fuzzy sets; Numerical methods; Probability distributions; Divergence measures; Exponential entropy; Fuzzy divergence; Fuzzy environments; ITS applications; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Shannon; Decision making","Verma, R.; Department of Applied Sciences, HMR Institute of Technology and Management, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha UniversityIndia; email: rkver83@gmail.com",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

One of such data analysis task in dynamic environment is to design an incremental classifier for decision making and consequently updating the knowledge base of the overall system. Classifier construction depicts extraction of interesting patterns from the large repository of data and predicts the future trends based on the existing patterns. The time complexity of the classification system increases gradually and the system becomes inefficient while it is learned repeatedly for adding new group of data with the existing one in a certain interval of time. Without learning the same classifier for the whole data, if the knowledge of old data extracted by the classifier is used together with the new group of data to design the updated classifier, called incremental classifier, then time complexity reduces drastically. In the paper, the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization technique and Association Rule Mining are used to design an incremental rule based classification system. The incremental classifier is suitable to apply on rice disease dataset for disease prediction as the characteristics of rice diseases change in time due to change of climate, biological, and geographical factors. The proposed method has been applied on both simulated rice disease dataset and benchmark datasets and the classification accuracy is measured and compared with various state of the art classification algorithms. The method is also evaluated based on some statistical measures and statistical test is done to establish its significance and effectiveness. © 2017","Data mining; Dynamic classifier; Incremental data; Particle Swarm Optimization; Rice disease","Climate change; Data handling; Data mining; Education; Evolutionary algorithms; Information analysis; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification system; Dynamic classifiers; Incremental data; Particle swarm optimization technique; Rule-based classification system; Statistical measures; Classification (of information); complexity; data mining; data set; decision making; design; disease; equipment; optimization; prediction; rice","Sengupta, S.; Department of Information Technology, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, India; email: shampa2512@yahoo.co.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681699,,CEAGE,,"English","Comput.

In order to overcome these issues, in this paper we propose a game theory and fuzzy based back off algorithm for MAC Protocol for multi traffic flows in wireless ad hoc networks. When a node wants to transmit a data packet, it estimates back-off interval based on the traffic priority, queue length, waiting time and remaining energy using the fuzzy logic. Then the data transmission involving various traffic classes is performed. At the receiver end, a utility function in terms of saturation throughput, delay and packet drop is derived. Then a game theory model is applied in which each player (node) suitably adjusts the back off interval again such that their utility function is maximized.

A fuzzy logic controller achieves the variation of the voltage transfer ratio from 0.866 to 5 by modifying the shoot through duty ratio of the quasi z source network. Modification in the shoot through duty ratio of the rectifier results in the improvement of the voltage boost factor of the quasi network which in turn varies the voltage transfer ratio. The fuzzy controller varies the shoot through duty ratio with input voltage error and set speed error. The proposed fuzzy-based QZSIMC can attain variable boost as well as buck function with variable shoot through duty ratio. Thus, this proposed method overcomes the limitation of constant boost. The proposed fuzzy-based QZSIMC widens the operating range of the induction motor during all the input voltage sag conditions and reduces the stress on the switches.

Specifically, we hypothesized that information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure (representing the Technology context), governance (representing the Organization context), and human capital (representing the Environment context) has both direct and indirect relationships with e-government maturity through the mediating roles of government's willingness to implement e-participation. Based on archival data from 183 countries, results showed that while ICT infrastructure and human capital were positively associated with government's willingness to implement e-participation and e-government maturity, governance was not significantly associated with them. Also, government's willingness to implement e-participation had significant associations with its e-government maturity. Specifically, of three dimensions of e-participation, government's willingness to implement e-information sharing and e-decision-making were positively associated with e-government maturity, and its willingness to implement e-consultation was negatively associated. Further, government's willingness to implement e-information sharing, e-consultation, and e-decision-making partially mediated the influences of ICT infrastructure and human capital on e-government maturity.

The application of soft set theory in the domain of product design and development is still not being efficiently utilised by previous works. Therefore, the benefit of soft set theory to define the attributes of an object through any type of approximations is used to deal with qualitative description of design criteria, by designers, and the linguistic requirements of customers. Bijective soft sets help the designers to effectively map individual customer requirements to the generated design concepts. With the help of Shannon entropy, customers’ preferences among the identified needs are captured in the new product development process, thus, improving the overall effectiveness of the concept evaluation process. This work considers concept evaluation process as a group multiple criteria decision making problem where, design specifications and customer requirements in qualitative form are first captured by using soft set theory and Shannon entropy and then, this information is incorporated in the framework of TOPSIS to identify the best concept in the evaluation process.

Typical applications of biometric recognition in AmI environments are identification techniques designed to recognize individuals in small datasets. Biometric recognition methods are frequently deployed on embedded hardware and therefore need to be optimized in terms of computational time as well as used memory. This paper presents a text-independent speaker recognition method particularly suitable for identification in AmI environments.

Load balancing between deterrent dependent tasks on virtual machines (VMs) in cloud datacenters is a significant feature of task arrangement procedure in the cloud environment. In this paper, the new task scheduling model has been proposed, which utilizes the honey bee inspired algorithm for the load balancing which maximize the throughput of virtual machines in the cloud and optimize the execution time of assigned dependent tasks for the proper utilization of resources in the least possible cost. The proposed model balances the load between the jobs on VM's in a way that the overall waiting time of tasks in the queue is minimized. The proposed model is designed to calculate the CPU time in terms of earliest finish time (EFT). The load is calculated on the basis of resource usage percentage whereas the communication cost is evaluated by using process memory allocation, memory requirement, and data size, which is further used for final decision making by comparing the communication cost with the process cost. The experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed model in comparison with the existing models. © 2016 IEEE.","Cost evaluation; Execution time; Honey bee Algorithm; Load balancing; Response time","Cloud computing; Costs; Decision making; Food products; Network security; Optimization; Resource allocation; Response time (computer systems); Virtual machine; Wireless networks; Cloud environments; Communication cost; Cost evaluations; Dependent tasks; Execution time; Honey bee; Memory requirements; Utilization of resources; Embedded systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509008933,,,"English","Int.

Farmers usually select crop for cultivation according to their traditional knowledge and past experience in farming, but a farmer’s predictions may go wrong due to natural disaster. Thus, decision-making tool need to be developed to help farmers to take decision on crop cultivation. In this paper, decision-making tool was developed for selecting the suitable crop that can be cultivated in a given agricultural land. In the present study, 26 input variables were identified and categorized into six broad heads of main variables such as soil, water, season, input, support and infrastructure. Each main variable has several sub-variables. The priority weights for the variables were determined using the dominance-based rough set approach. In order to convert sub-variable sequences to main variable sequences, evaluation scores of each main variable were calculated by applying the weights of sub-variables and by using simple additive method. Finally, the evaluation scores were applied to Johnson’s reduct algorithm and classification rules were generated. The developed tool predicts each site in the datasets into one of the three crops such as paddy, groundnut and sugarcane. In order to validate the performance of the tool, the same datasets were predicted again by agriculture experts. The results obtained from the tool showed 92% agreement with the results obtained from the experts. Thus, the tool is a feasible tool for cultivating the suitable crops in the agricultural sites. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Agriculture; Classification; Crop selection; Dominance-based rough set approach; Johnson’s reduct","Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Disasters; Rough set theory; Agricultural sites; Agriculture development; Classification rules; Competitive environment; Crop selections; Decision making tool; Dominance-based rough set approach; Traditional knowledge; Agriculture","Deepa, N.; School of Information Technology & Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: deepa.rajesh@vit.ac.in",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

Sensor platforms offer several advantages in comparison to the traditional monitoring approaches based on discrete sampling methods as they offer the capability of providing high resolution data. Access to high-frequency spatial and temporal information facilitates real-time event detection or then understanding the impact of pollution to the water quality in natural water resources. In this paper, we report a multi-sensor process that we developed for in-situ monitoring of water pollution in rivers/lakes in which we acquire real-time water quality data using (a) a multiparametric sensor probe for quantitative data, (b) a crowd sensor via a mobile app for qualitative data and integrate these data onto a cloud platform i.e Bluemix which enables interactive visualization of data as Heatmap combined with geographical mapping. This type of visualization technique not only facilitates effective handling of high-resolution data but also allows large-scale data-driven inspection to identify affected/polluted zones and detection of pollution violations, thereby making it an important tool for enabling decision-making. Data analysis based on clustering techniques is also presented. We compare our techniques to traditional data collection methods. Furthermore, to support our efforts in water quality monitoring, we have also developed several web-based applications that are aimed at incorporating sensing data as well as data from various other sources onto a common online platform.

In many cases it seems that the product hardly attains its principal objectives due to improper prioritization. Increased emphasis on requirement prioritization and highly dynamic requirements makes management of composite services time consuming and difficult task. When software project has rigid timelines, limited resources, but high client expectations, an instantaneous deployment of most vital and critical features becomes mandatory. The problem can be solved by prioritizing the requirements. Over the past years, various techniques for requirement prioritization are presented by a variety of researchers in software engineering domain.

Moreover, the best and the last performers observed as a result of benchmarking through these techniques were uniquely the same. A little discrepancy in the ranks of two departments is observed. However, this slight variation in results is due to the basic differences in methodology involved in the techniques used. © 2017 IEEE.","Benchmarking-Academi; etc; MAUT; MOOSRA; multi-criteria decision making; SDV MOORA","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Decision making; Decision theory; Academic department; Communication engineering; Engineering colleges; MAUT; MOOSRA; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-attribute utility theory; SDV MOORA; Benchmarking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062188,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In order to overcome this situation the usage of non conventional energy sources have become research hotspot during the past decade. In his context autonomous PV and wind integrated hybrid systems have been found economically viable alternative to supply energy continuously to the numerous deficit customers. Individual configuration of solar or wind power leads to fluctuations in system. When combined together will provide a reliable and sustainable source with constant flow energy. PV and Wind energy systems are combined at the DC bus and its voltage is magnified to required level by using DC-DC Step-Up converter. This paper deals with common grid perturbations like balanced voltage dips, unbalances voltages and harmonic distortions. The generated output power from the PV/wind system is fed to all connected loads. Under surplus power condition excess power is fed to the utility grid.

The simulation is done in SIMULINK/ MATLAB Software. The RMS inverter output voltage at transformer's secondary side is kept slightly higher than the RMS grid voltage and the power transfer to the grid is controlled by controlling the phase lag angle of grid with respect to the inverter. It is shown that when the phase lag angle of the grid is changed, the THD in grid current, RMS grid current, active power and reactive power changes while RMS voltage at transformer primary & secondary and output voltage THD remains approximately the same. The simulation is done for battery as well as Solar PV and found that the results are approximately same. This paper shows that if the phases lag angle increases, the grid current THD reduces and RMS grid current increases. The simulation results with the variation of phase angle are tabulated and the variations of THD, P and Q with phase angle are shown graphically.

Many innovations are discovered in the field of OCR, but still many challengers are waiting for the solutions such as the recognition of document-backside-layered characters along with front side layer characters. The recognition of paper-backside-layered handwritten cum printed text is very difficult than the recognition of paper-frontside-layered characters. The fuzzy logic system process the data with help of bunch set of primary-based knowledge and delivers it into high successive recognition rate by using fuzzy classification functions, inference rules with decision-making procedures. Neural networks are compatible and best area to solve the pattern cum text recognition tasks, the learning based process start to implement from the basic imprecise data and algorithmic steps are formed with help of neuron-based learning process cum observations, but it is not effective to accomplish the user expected requirements for making the decisions. The successful combinational platform of neural fuzzy based closed loop system is proposing many technical ideas with effective solutions to solve the significant problems in OCR. This research methodology has proposed the mirror image reflection approach for recognition of document backside layer characters by using neural fuzzy hybrid system: it categorize the single page into the two sub layers, the first sub layer contains the paper front side text and the second sub layer contains paper back side text with corresponding pictures, characters, numerals and figures. Here the front sub layer text is completely bypassed with backside layer. The document-backside-layer input characters converted into neural-inputs, transformed it into fuzzy-sets, then fuzzy-rules applied based on the knowledge in fuzzification, related output responses are generated and the pre-cum-post-processing technique has applied to backside layer characters.

As it's an important task to reach consumer's demand for good quality mango, automation in grading of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) is required. This paper is addressing the grading issue of agricultural produce based on its maturity and size. The Fuzzy inference system is used for decision-making process. Prediction of mango's maturity is done through its skin's color but for some exceptional tribe of mango like 'Langdo', skin color will remain the same for its lifetime. In such cases, normal imaging (reflective imaging) will not work for predicting its maturity. One can use infrared, x-ray or thermal imaging for maturity prediction. Here mango grading is performed based on maturity and size feature. For that, with mean intensity algorithm in L∗a∗b∗ color space and FLIR ONE thermal camera is used to predict the maturity of mango. Size of mangois predicted by three parameters namely weight, eccentricity and area. Fuzzy classifier is used for predicting size feature. To grade mango decision making theory is used and mango is graded in two different classes. Time needed to grade a mango is 2.3 seconds and accuracy received is 89%. © 2017 IEEE.","Feature extraction; Fuzzy classifier; Mango grading; Thermal imaging","Classification (of information); Color; Decision making; Decision theory; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Grading; Infrared imaging; Decision making process; Decision-making theories; Different class; Fuzzy classifiers; Fuzzy inference systems; Mangifera indica; Non destructive; Three parameters; Fruits",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034048,,,"English","Int.

In GORE, goals are the need of the stakeholders. These goals are refined and decomposed into sub-goals until the responsibility of the last goals are assigned to some agent or some software system. In literature different methods have been developed based on GORE concepts for the identification of software goals or software requirements like fuzzy attributed goal oriented software requirements analysis (FAGOSRA) method, knowledge acquisition for automated specifications (KAOS), iframework, attributed goal oriented requirements analysis (AGORA) method, etc. In AGORA, decision makers use subjective values during the selection and the prioritization of software requirements. AGORA method can be extended by computing the objective values. These objective values can be obtained by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In AGORA, there is no support to check whether the values provided by the decision makers are consistent or not. Therefore, in order to address this issue we proposed a method for the prioritization of software requirements by applying the AHP in goal oriented requirements elicitation method. Finally, we consider an example to explain the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","analytic hierarchy process; FAGOSRA; Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering; requirements prioritization; software requirements","Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Software agents; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); FAGOSRA; Goal oriented requirements analysis; Goal-oriented requirements engineering; Requirements elicitation; Requirements prioritization; Software requirements; Software requirements analysis; Requirements engineering",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062188,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Hence one has to be cautious and at the same time be able to avert any danger if any of such situation prevails But humans can make some errors based on their decision which may lead to loss of life. Hence there is a need to introduce an decision support system (DSS), which would take correct decisions based on the inputs. This paper presents the design and implementation of fuzzy logic based decision support system. Fuzzy logic mimics the human decisions as per the inputs. So the chances of propofol being infused wrongly are minimized. Also various parameters like heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure is continuously monitored. Based upon these inputs to the fuzzy decision support system and Lab-view Graphical user interface (GUI) will give appropriate decision as the depth of anesthesia. Hence the risk to life is attenuated to great extent. This type of decision support system can be used in hospitals and health-care facilities and will prove useful not only to professionals but also to the newcomers in the field of anesthesia. Another advantage of this system is cost effective and viable for human society. Experts based decision support system is designed and implemented using Lab-view. Developed GUI is validated from experts for 270 different conditions.

So far it is difficult to test all the user inputs invoked, therefore, test case prioritization is essentially required for giving more priority to test cases which reveal higher faults comparatively. We have proposed test case prioritization for EDS: as the Event Type, Interaction of Event, and Coverage of Event. Priority assigned in the proposed model uses these factors in Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) MATLAB Toolbox based on Neuro-Fuzzy logic model. Evaluation and validation will be done using Average Percentage of Fault Detection (APFD). APFD rate for prioritized sequence using the proposed Neuro-Fuzzy logic model exhibited 81% rate, whereas, non-prioritized test sequences showed70% suggesting, thereby, that after prioritization; rate of fault detection has improved considerably. Data shows that proposed Neuro-Fuzzy logic model is apt for Test Case Prioritization of EDS Testing. © 2016 IEEE.","Average Percentage of Fault Detection (APFD); Event Coverage; Event Driven Software (EDS); Neuro-Fuzzy Mode; Test Case Prioritization","Computer circuits; Fault detection; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; MATLAB; Testing; Average Percentage of Fault Detection (APFD); Event Coverage; Event-driven softwares; Neuro-Fuzzy; Test case prioritization; Software testing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467369848,,,"English","India Int.

The forgery detection method proposed here makes use of fine inconsistencies in the colour of the lighting of images. Our approach is machine-learning based which makes use of a behaviour knowledge space. This technique can be used in photographs having two or more people. To achieve forgery detection, complementary illuminant estimators are incorporated on image regions of similar material. Colour-, texture- and edge-based features are extracted from these illuminant estimates which are then provided to a machine-learning approach for automatic decision-making. © 2017 IEEE.","Image forensics; Machine learning; Spliced image detection; Texture and edge descriptors","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision making; Forensic engineering; Automatic decision; Descriptors; Forgery detections; Image detection; Image forensics; Image forgery detections; Image manipulation; Machine learning approaches; Learning systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052974,,,"English","Proc.

Ontologies are a formal way of representing conceptual knowledge and can be related to text data to assist in this task. There is always a need for accurate interpretation of medical records of cancer patients in deciding intervention plans for proper treatment. However due to the ever changing demand in healthcare services such information sources can be highly variable and may not be suitable for all patients. In this situation the most challenging problem is personalizing healthcare treatment adapted to the patient's medical, social and economic conditions. To manage this problem efficiently the work suggests an ontology alignment model using context aware properties of the system and the patient to facilitate decision making. A patient ontology is mapped to the disease ontology to dynamically transform general treatment options into individual intervention plans most suitable for the patient. The proposed method can be used by medical professionals in recognizing incorrect diagnosis, preventive actions or in identifying co-occurring diseases in the patient. © 2016 IEEE.","Cancer treatment; Context awareness; Ontology alignment; Personalization","Data mining; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Oncology; Ontology; Conceptual knowledge; Context- awareness; Healthcare services; Information exchanges; Information sources; Medical professionals; Ontology alignment; Personalizations; Patient treatment",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467369848,,,"English","India Int.

HFSS is considered as a powerful tool to represent uncertain information in group decision-making process. In this study, we introduce the concept of correlation coefficient for HFSS and some of its properties. Using correlation coefficient of HFSS, we develop correlation efficiency which shows the significance of the HFSS. We also propose an algorithm to apply correlation coefficient in decision-making problem, where information is presented in hesitant fuzzy environment. In order to extend the application of HFSS, we propose correlation coefficient in the framework of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy soft set (IVHFSS). We also introduce correlation efficiency in the context of IVHFSS. Then the proposed algorithm is extended using IVHFSS for solving decision-making problems.

The selection of control strategy for this type of inverter plays a significant role in deciding the inverter output voltage and current profile. In this regard, this paper presents the performance analysis of 5-level CMLI with multicarrier modulation technique with two different types of modulating waves namely, sine and elliptical wave. The performance analysis has carried out with and without load. The output voltage and current profiles are analyzed with respect to rms value and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) at different modulation indices. The harmonic spectrum of each control strategy has been discussed in detail with help of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) block of MATLAB/S IMULINK tool. The elliptical modulating wave produces root mean square (RMS) value of the output voltage equal to 184.2V when compared to sine wave equal to 164.2V, at modulation index set to 1; this shows the improved DC bus utilization in elliptical modulating wave. © 2017 IEEE.","Elliptical Wave; Modified MultiCarrier (MMC) PWM; Modulation Index; Root Mean Square; Total Harmoic Distortion","Fast Fourier transforms; Modulation; Pulse width modulation; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Cascaded multi-level inverters; Elliptical waves; Multi carrier; Multicarrier modulation technique; Performance analysis; Root Mean Square; Root mean square values; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

User behaviour analysis in different domains based on web logs has its utility for enterprises to have strategic decision making. Business growth of enterprises depends on customer-centric approaches that need to know the knowledge of customer behaviour to succeed. The rationale behind this is that customers have alternatives and there is intense competition. Therefore business community needs business intelligence to have expert decisions besides focusing customer relationship management. Many researchers contributed towards this end. However, the need for a comprehensive framework that caters to the needs of businesses to ascertain real needs of web users. This paper presents a framework named eXtensible Web Usage Mining Framework (XWUMF) for discovering actionable knowledge from web log data. The framework employs a hybrid approach that exploits fuzzy clustering methods and methods for user behaviour analysis. Moreover the framework is extensible as it can accommodate new algorithms for fuzzy clustering and user behaviour analysis. We proposed an algorithm known as Sequential Web Usage Miner (SWUM) for efficient mining of web usage patterns from different datasets. We built a prototype application to validate our framework.

Agricultural meteorology is the science that applies knowledge in weather data relating to atmospheric environment observed by instruments on the ground and by remote sensing. Most of the data need to be processed for generating various decisions such as cropping and scheduling of irrigation. This paper describes a data mining study of agricultural meteorological patterns collected from meteorological centre of Bengaluru district. We use K Means and Hierarchical clustering techniques to extract patterns like minimum (15 to 17°C) and maximum (28 to 29°C) air temperature, relative humidity (79 to 96%) in the interim of morning hours and (42 to 50%) in the interim of noon hours, rainfall (0 mm) and pan evaporation (5.22 to 7.2 mm) which gives great significance to predict probable result. The obtained results play a crucial role in the decision making for sustainable agriculture. Along with this we also compared these algorithms by applying Connectivity, Silhouette width and Dunn index formula which measures internal validation of clustering techniques. The results indicate that Hierarchical technique performs better than K Means in terms of Connectivity (10.1671), Silhouette width (0.4084) and Dunn index (0.4619). © 2017 IEEE.","Data Mining; Hierarchical Clustering; K Means Clustering; Meteorological Data","Agriculture; Atmospheric humidity; Data mining; Decision making; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Atmospheric environment; Clustering techniques; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical techniques; K-means clustering; Meteorological data; Meteorological patterns; Sustainable agriculture; Cluster analysis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Good power quality is defined in terms of voltage, current and frequency. The problems manifested in these electrical quantities may lead to disturbances in power quality. The effect of poor power quality can cause equipment for failure and breakdown, as the most of power electronic devices fail to sustain voltage variations and may stops working. Power quality disturbances must be detected and localized in order to avoid such incidents which will cause huge economic loss in industrial as well as in commercial areas. The power quality events are classified according to disturbance duration specifically, short and long duration events. Short duration voltage events namely, voltage interruption, sag and swell occur from 0.5 cycle to 1 min with respective decrease or increase in the rms voltage. This paper gives detection and characterization of these voltage events by extracting the features using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). These features are again utilized for the classification of these events using rule based fuzzy logic. This combination of DWT and fuzzy logic gives classification of power quality disturbances. Several simulations on detection and characterization by DWT are performed. Classification in case of these short duration voltage event is important. Hence this novel classification of all these voltage disturbance using fuzzy logic is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Discrete wavelet transform; Fuzzy expert system; Power quality; Short duration voltage events","Characterization; Computer circuits; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Losses; Voltage distribution measurement; Wavelet transforms; Electrical power supply; Electrical quantities; Equipment manufacture; Fuzzy expert systems; Power electronic devices; Power quality disturbances; Voltage event; Voltage interruptions; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The proposed converter is composed of coupled-inductor and switched-capacitor techniques to achieve high step-up conversion ratio without adopting extremely high duty ratio or high turns ratio. The capacitors are charged in parallel and discharged in series by the coupled inductor to achieve high step-up voltage gain with an appropriate duty ratio. Besides, the voltage stress on the main switch is reduced with a passive clamp circuit, and the conduction losses are reduced. In addition, the reverse-recovery problem of the diode is alleviated by a coupled inductor. Thus, the efficiency can be further improved. The operating principle, steady state analysis and design of the proposed single switch converter with high step-up gain is carried out. A 24 V input voltage, 400 V output, and 300W maximum output power integrated converter is designed and analysed using MATLAB simulink.

Critical issues like increasing domestic energy usage, if addressed via machine learning techniques in current IOT devices will tremendously help humans in unimaginable ways. The concern of price hikes in energy and the adverse effects on the environment due to inefficient energy usage is a subject that concerns a larger segment of the population. Human behavior plays an important role in energy expenditure. Markets shall never cease to flood with electronic gadgets and humans shall never cease to fancy the upcoming ones that majorly contributes to increasing energy consumption. So we propose a framework with load optimization strategy that shall be responsive to realtime pricing which will exclude frequent human intervention. The load will be optimized during the times of high pricing or when the total power consumption of the household exceeds the maximum constraint. However, Optimal Load Management strategy requires price prediction that can be generated using real-Time price algorithm and human activity prediction to ensure discrete decision making. This paper proposes an idea to mitigate energy consumption by modeling human behavior via a combination of Hidden Markov Model and Naive Bayes classifier. Also, we try to minimize the errors generated due to motion/occupancy sensors while detecting a human or an animal(pet). Sometimes activation of motion sensors can result in the wrong detection which can further lead to incorrect activity recognition which then can generate errors in optimizing loads. Therefore, we integrate classification algorithms in our framework which can further aid in correct detection and subsequent strategy generation. © 2016 IEEE.","Demand side management; hidden Markov model (HMM); human behavior; Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC); Optimum Load Management strategy; Real time pricing; Smart home energy management systems","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Behavioral research; Chemical detection; Classifiers; Costs; Decision making; Demand side management; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy utilization; Hidden Markov models; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Optimization; Process control; Real time systems; Social sciences; Human behaviors; Naive Bayes classifiers; Optimum loads; Real time pricing; Smart home energy management systems; Energy management systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041084,,,"English","Int.

It is being recorded every year that the loss due to these fraudulent acts is billions of dollars. These activities are carried out so elegantly so it is similar to genuine transactions. Hence simple pattern related techniques and other less complex methods are really not going to work.

Lamentably, the mute people are dispossessed of this boon. 'Artificial Voice synthesizer' helps them to overcome this difficulty and communicate with the world in an efficient way. The principle objective of the artificial voice synthesizer is to make dumb people to communicate easily with other people even who cannot understand the sign language. Communication can be made easier by giving artificial voice to the dumb people so that they do not face any kind of difficulty in communicating with the world. This device makes use of neural sensors which is fixed over the head and behind the user's ear lobe. The users can make their usual signs for conveying their ideas. The sensors senses the brain impulses as each hand movement have a specific set of brain impulses and then some specific calculations are made using Discrete Fourier Transform. The fuzzy logics in Artificial intelligence is used to match the obtained solutions of the converted signals with the stored solutions so that it converts the impulses into voice and gives that voice(the translated, artificially synthesized voice of the dumb people) as output which makes others to understand their comments easily. Thus the 'Artificial voice synthesizer' comfort the dumb person in overcoming their disability by communicating like a normal person. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Conversion of signals into voice messages; Fuzzy logics; Neural impulses; Processing of signals","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Discrete Fourier transforms; Speech communication; Artificial voice; Hand movement; Neural impulses; Neural sensors; Sign language; Voice messages; Fuzzy logic",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062201,,,"English","Proc.

The input DC supply to the lower semi stage converter is given by means of the input DC supply and the input to the higher semi stage is given by means of DC supply and the output voltage of the lower semi stage converter.

For load balancing and efficient data collection in the network, clustering is used. Sensors in each cluster send the data to their corresponding cluster heads. The cluster head performs data aggregation and transmission of the aggregated data to the base station. Farther sensor nodes data are aggregated by cluster heads and send to the base station. This leads to a heavy traffic and faster depletion of energy to the nodes that are nearer to the sink. To enhance the energy conservation, for suppressing hot spot problem and for load balance achievement, we propose an algorithm namely as ECUCF (Energy Conserved Unequal Clusters with Fuzzy logic). Based on the distances of the nodes from the base station, the network is divided into three different sectors. For designing unequal clusters in each sector, a fuzzy logic approach is followed. The cluster heads that are nearer to the base station are designed to be of smaller sizes whereas the cluster heads that are situated farther away from the sink to have higher cluster sizes. The proposed algorithm ECUCF is simulated using MATLAB environment. The performances obtained are compared with the performances of other clustering schemes like LEACH (equal clustering algorithm) and FBUC (unequal clustering algorithm).

Investors employ different means of analysis for expert decision making including periodical trade indicators, industry growth indicators, and economic forecasts. An automated approach for stock trading analysis is inevitable as there is huge amount of temporal data is involved. Several techniques came into existence as revealed in the literature. Data mining techniques are, of late, widely used for discovering trends of stock market. High-confidence rules extracted using such techniques are found instrumental to make well-informed decisions. In this paper we propose a framework with an underlying approach to have casual data mining which explores inter-transaction relationships that are latent in the stock datasets.

Firstly, the proposed algorithm employs band pass filter (BPF) and low pass filter (LPF) for the determination of the peak magnitude of fundamental component of load current, Im1. Secondly, BPF and LPF are utilized to process the supply voltage for unit vector template generation (UVT), thereby ensuring effective operation even under nonsinusoidal supply voltage. Lastly, based on Im1 and UVT, the proposed LPF-BPF fundamental current extractor provides instantaneous value of fundamental active component of load current which when drawn from the supply ensures that the source current is sinusoidal and unity power factor (UPF) is maintained at the supply end. The extracted current is further processed to take into account the regulation and balancing of the dc-link voltages. The operation of the 1-phase FL-CHBI based D-STATCOM with the LPF-BPF fundamental current extractor scheme is analyzed for steady state and dynamic operation under non-distorted and distorted supply voltages.

There are two issues being addressed in this paper. The first is the selection of the most convenient transportation mode. We present a method for solving multi-criteria decision-making problem to deal with evaluating and ranking alternatives from the best to the worst with respect to decision maker(s) preferences. This is applied to find the most preferred transportation mode among available modes concerning some evaluation criteria for a transportation problem. A possibility degree is used for comparisons between the overall values of alternatives to raise a possibility degree matrix. Based on that matrix, the alternatives are ranked according to the ranking vector derived from the matrix, and the best one is selected. The second is to construct a multi-item transportation problem using that preferred mode of transportation. To get the crisp model, a defuzzification approach is adopted. To convert multi-objective transportation problem into a single-objective problem, two different techniques (i) fuzzy goal programming method and (ii) convex combination method are used. Then the reduced single-objective problem is solved by generalized reduced gradient method (LINGO-14.0) and a set of optimal solutions are obtained and presented graphically. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Convex combination method; Fuzzy goal programming method; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Multi-criteria decision-making problem; Possibility degree; Transportation problem","Computer programming; Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Gradient methods; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Convex combination method; Fuzzy goal programming; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Possibility degree; Transportation problem; Transportation","Jana, D.K.; Department of Applied Sciences, Haldia Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: dipakjana@hithaldia.ac.in",,"Springer London",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

However, it is a challenging task involving several issues. Sometimes, the available domain knowledge may help in dealing with certain issues in this regard. This work proposes a multivariate prediction approach based on a variant of semantic Bayesian network, termed as semBnet. The key objective of semBnet is to incorporate the spatial semantics as a form of domain knowledge, in standard/classical Bayesian network (SBN), and thereby improving the accuracy of meteorological prediction. It has been shown that compared to SBN, the proposed semBnet is less prone to parameter value uncertainty. Empirical studies on multivariate prediction of Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall and Soil moisture demonstrate the superiority of proposed approach over linear statistical models (e.g. ARIMA, spatio-temporal ordinary kriging (ST-OK)), and non-linear prediction techniques based on ANN, SBN, hierarchical Bayesian autoregressive model (HBAR) etc. Most significantly, compared to SBN, the proposed semBnet shows average 24% improvement in mean absolute percentage error of prediction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian network; Domain knowledge; Meteorology; Semantic similarity; Spatial semantics; Time series prediction","Bayesian networks; Decision making; Forecasting; Meteorology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Soil moisture; Time series; Domain knowledge; Mean absolute percentage error; Meteorological prediction; Meteorological time series predictions; Non-linear predictions; Semantic similarity; Spatial semantics; Time series prediction; Weather forecasting","Das, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur 721302, India; email: monidipadas@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678655,,,,"English","Pattern Recogn.

In this protocol, whenever a network event occurs, the kind of event occurring is recognized in order to handle it accordingly.

People uses wireless technology along with sensor for monitoring home held devices, security alerts, natural disasters alert, building supervision, industrial quality management, etc. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of thousands of economical and feasible disposable sensors, deployed in the environment to sense parameters related to the surroundings such as temperature, moisture level, pressure etc., Number of sensor nodes are connected in these networks for communication. Each nodes are self-organized, having the capacity of sense, process, and aggregate data. Energy utilization in WSN is major issue in networks for improving network lifetime. Conventional clustering schemes are created with static cluster heads that die past than the normal nodes that degrade the network performance in routing. It is very vital area to develop an energy aware clustering protocol in WSN to reduce energy consumption for increasing network life time. In this paper, a Energy Aware Clustering using Neuro-fuzzy approach (EACNF) is proposed to form finest and energy aware clusters. The proposed scheme consists of fuzzy subsystem and neural network system that achieved energy efficiency in forming clusters and cluster heads in WSN. EACNF used neural network that provide effective training set related to energy and density of all nodes to estimate the expected energy for Uncertain cluster heads. Sensor nodes with higher energy are trained with various location of base station to select energy aware cluster heads. Fuzzy if–then mapping rule is used in fuzzy logic part that inputs to form clusters and cluster heads. EACNF is designed for WSN that handling Trust factor for security to the network. EACNF used three metric such as transmission range, residual energy and Trust factor for improving network life time. The proposed scheme EACNF is compared with related clustering schemes namely Cluster-Head Election Mechanism using Fuzzy Logic and Energy-Aware Fuzzy Unequal Clustering. The experiment results show that EACNF performs better than the other related schemes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Neural network; Wireless sensor network","Computer circuits; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Neural networks; Power management; Quality management; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster-head elections; Clustering; Conventional clustering; Industrial quality management; Neural network systems; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless technologies; Power management (telecommunication)","Golden Julie, E.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: goldenjuliephd@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994449416

This paper addresses an adaptive fuzzy PI sliding mode control (AFPISMC) for trajectory tracking control of AUV to achieve high precise maneuvering in undersea environment. An AFPISMC is basically comprised of an equivalent control based on approximately known inverse dynamic model output and continuous adaptive PI term is designed to eliminate chattering effect. Furthermore, it does not require a priori knowledge of upper bounds on uncertainties in the dynamic parameters of an AUV. In this approach, decoupled single input fuzzy PI control strategy is employed along with a reduced rule base and self-tuning control law is derived to modify hitting gain in order to enhance tracking response. The overall control scheme guarantees the global asymptotic stability based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptive control; Autonomous underwater vehicle; Fuzzy logic system; Lyapunov theory; Tracking control","Adaptive control systems; Asymptotic stability; Control theory; Fuzzy logic; Lyapunov methods; Maneuverability; Navigation; Sailing vessels; Sliding mode control; Vehicles; Water craft; Water waves; Adaptive Control; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); Fuzzy logic system; Global asymptotic stability; Lyapunov theories; Of autonomous underwater vehicles; Tracking controls; Trajectory tracking control; Autonomous underwater vehicles","Lakhekar, G.V.; Department of Electrical Engineering, G.

Accuracy of segmentation approach dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process itself i.e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step. Methods To address the above issues, in this paper a fourth order partial differential equation (FPDE) based nonlinear filter adapted to Poisson noise with fuzzy c-means segmentation method is proposed. This approach is capable of effectively handling the segmentation problem of blocky artifacts while achieving good tradeoff between Poisson noise removals and edge preservation of the microscopic biopsy images during segmentation process for cancer detection from cells. Results The proposed approach is tested on breast cancer microscopic biopsy data set with region of interest (ROI) segmented ground truth images. The microscopic biopsy data set contains 31 benign and 27 malignant images of size 896 × 768. The region of interest selected ground truth of all 58 images are also available for this data set. Finally, the result obtained from proposed approach is compared with the results of popular segmentation algorithms; fuzzy c-means, color k-means, texture based segmentation, and total variation fuzzy c-means approaches. Conclusions The experimental results shows that proposed approach is providing better results in terms of various performance measures such as Jaccard coefficient, dice index, Tanimoto coefficient, area under curve, accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, random index, global consistency error, and variance of information as compared to other segmentation approaches used for cancer detection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cell and nuclei segmentation; Fourt order PDE based nonlinear filter; Fuzzy c-means segmentation; Medical image segmentation; Microscopic biopsy images; Segmentation in presence of Poisson noise","Biopsy; Diseases; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy systems; Image processing; Medical imaging; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear filtering; Poisson equation; Biopsy images; Fourth order partial differential equations; Fuzzy C mean; Nuclei segmentation; Poisson noise; Segmentation algorithms; Segmentation process; Texture-based segmentations; Image segmentation; Article; artifact; benign breast tumor; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; color k means segmentation; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; false negative result; false positive result; fourth order partial differential equation; fuzzy c means segmentation; fuzzy system; image analysis; image segmentation; measurement accuracy; measurement error; noise reduction; nonlinear system; Poisson distribution; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; texture based segmentation; total variation fuzzy c means segmentation; tumor biopsy; algorithm; biopsy; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; human; image processing; neoplasm; Algorithms; Biopsy; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neoplasms","Srivastava, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu UniversityIndia; email: rajeev.cse@iitbhu.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28688490","English","Comput.

Numerous tangible and intangible benefits of SaaS adoption enable organizations to reduce costs, increase efficiency, leverage latest technology without additional investment, enhance concentration on core business processes and enhance innovation. This inspires more users especially the Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) to adopt SaaS for their business operations. Service providers have come up with wide array of SaaS products to meet the customer demands. However, a plethora of factors involved in pre-SaaS evaluation process and availability of several products for a single business operation makes it difficult for customers to choose the best reliable product for their business requirements. A tool to perform customer perspective based reliability evaluation of single product or comparative reliability based ranking of multiple products is currently not available. This issue has been addressed in the present research work and a Customer Oriented Reliability Evaluation (CORE) framework is proposed. AHP, one of the MCDM methods is used in the framework which accepts the comparative attribute preferences and assigns their weights, based on which the reliability values are calculated. The CORE framework facilitates customers to perform efficient SaaS product decision making process based on business requirement and their attribute preferences.

Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources.

Due to these characteristics uncertainty is an integral part of MANET behavior. Uncertainty quantification is important for performance evaluation and better decision making in MANET. Packet dropping is a serious issue in MANET which degrades the performance of the network to a great extent. The packet dropping attack increases uncertainty in the network communication and eventually of the MANET. Trust based routing mechanisms are useful for neutralizing packet dropping attack. There are many existing trust based routing protocols which uses uncertainty for precise trust calculations. Thus, trust and uncertainty are closely related to each other. The paper proposes Uncertainty Analysis Framework (UAF) for MANET, it calculates the network Belief, Disbelief, and Uncertainty (BDU) values. The UAF framework integrated into different trust variants of AODV protocol which use direct trust, indirect trust, and global trust. The research work discovers impact of different trust models on MANET BDU using various mobility models.

Therefore, monitoring the respiratory rate by detecting the different breath phases is crucial. Objectives This study aimed to segment the breath cycles from pulmonary acoustic signals using the newly developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on breath phase detection and to subsequently evaluate the performance of the system. Methods The normalised averaged power spectral density for each segment was fuzzified, and a set of fuzzy rules was formulated. The ANFIS was developed to detect the breath phases and subsequently perform breath cycle segmentation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient values were calculated and analysed, and the proposed method was then validated using data collected at KIMS Hospital and the RALE standard dataset. Results The analysis of the correlation coefficient of the neuro-fuzzy model, which was performed to evaluate its performance, revealed a correlation strength of r = 0.9925, and the RMSE for the neuro-fuzzy model was found to equal 0.0069.

In-app publishers go through ad-space aggregators known as Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs), who, in turn, act as intermediaries for ad-agency aggregators known as demand-side platforms. The SSPs face the twin issue of making ad placement decisions within an order of milliseconds, even though their revenue streams can be optimized only by a careful selection of ads that elicit appropriate user responses regarding impressions, clicks, and conversions. This article considers the SSP's perspective and presents an online algorithm that balances these two issues. Our experimental results indicate that the decision-making time generally ranges between 20 ms and 50 ms and accuracy from 1% to 10%. Further, we conduct statistical analysis comparing the theoretical complexity of the online algorithm with its empirical performance.

This concept which arises from IFSSs, is generalized by including a moderator’s opinion regarding the validity of the information at hand, thus making it highly suitable for use in decision-making problems that involve uncertain, vague and/or unreliable data. In this paper, we introduce the tools that measure the distance, similarity and the degree of fuzziness of GIFSSs. The axiomatic definitions of the distance measure is introduced and subsequently used to define the similarity measure and intuitionistic entropy induced by this distance measure. Some of the algebraic properties of these measures are also verified. The well-known Hamming, normalized Hamming, Euclidean and normalized Euclidean distances are generalized to make them compatible with the concept of GIFSSs.

This type of problem is complex and is comprised of a number of practicalities: (i) a large number of decision variables, (ii) at least two inter-dependent levels of optimization between policy makers and policy followers, and (iii) uncertainty in decision variables and problem parameters. Given agricultural and economic data from the Raccoon watershed in central Iowa, we formulate a bilevel multi-objective optimization problem that accommodates objectives of both policy makers and farmers. The solution procedure then explicitly accounts for the nested nature offarm-level management decisions in response to agri-environmental policy incentives constructed by policy makers. We specifically examine the spatial targeting of a fertilizer-reduction incentive policy while seeking to maximize farm-level productivity while generating mandated water quality improvements using this framework. We test three different evolutionary optimization algorithms - m-BLEAQ, NSGA-II, and SPEA2 - and show that m-BLEAQ is well suited for handling the bilevel optimization problems and the considered practicalities. © 2017 ACM.","Bilevel optimization; Decision-making; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization","Agriculture; Decision making; Environmental protection; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Water quality; Watersheds; Agri-environmental policies; Agricultural policies; Bi-level optimization; Bilevel optimization problems; Evolutionary optimization algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Solution procedure; Water quality improvements; Optimization",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450349208,,,"English","GECCO - Proc.

Conversely, the curbs of these networks such as unreliable wireless medium, unpredictable topology, no central administration, fuel the compulsion of a key based cryptographic algorithm to defend data traffic. In this perspective, substantial research work has been done in the last decade or so and ascertained that the trust based frameworks for group key management deliver superior performance than others. Since the nodes in ad hoc networks have limited computing resources, the overall performance of the system depends on how effectively and securely designed the system. This encourages us to work on a framework which consumes less computing power and also invulnerable to internal as well as external attacks. We propose a framework which reduces the network resource consumption for the trust request and collection using game theory concept. The energy of the wireless nodes are significantly saved by choosing the novel strategy called as finding optimal set of remote nodes to send the response for trust request using game theory. Choosing local optimal at each stage eventually leads to global optimal. Later, synthesize the collected trust and handle the attacks using fuzzy concept in order to get the degree of trustworthiness instead of binary classification. We prove with our simulation results that our proposed scheme reduces overhead of the network significantly while without compromising security aspects.","Attacks; Dishonest nodes; Fuzzy logic; Game theory; Group key management; Mobile ad hoc network; Trust management framework",,"Gundluru, N.; School of Information Technology and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: nagaraja.g@vit.ac.in",,"Intelligent Network and Systems Society",2185310X,,,,"English","Int.

The key idea behind SDN is separation of control plane from data plane, as a result devices in the data plane becomes the forwarding device and transfer all the decision making activities in a centralized system called a controller. In SDN architecture, it is a great challenge to find a solution to the controller placement problem (CPP). The CPP decides where to place the K number of controllers with a limited amount of resources within the SDN network. Among many proposed solutions to this problem, we apply clustering algorithms such as K-median, K-center on the topology which are obtained from a topology-zoo. A spectral clustering technique has been proposed for partitioning the network and place the controller within the sub-domain.

As our system contains strong non-linearity, fuzzy logic control has the potential to resolve the non-linearity issue. The control objective is by controlling pitch angle and generator torque, generator power regulation is optimized and torsional torque fluctuation of drive train is minimized.

Financial inclusion that aims at extending financial and related services to all citizens is considered an important contributor to development. It is argued that financial inclusion, as a strategy, would encourage citizens to enhance their activity portfolios and would encourage savings, empower women, facilitate remittance, boost production and consumption. E-Governance services are aimed at interventions with the primary purpose of enhancing citizen engagements on line, creating enabling conditions for interactions. Focus of E-Governance services is also on empowering citizens with the scope to reduce information asymmetry, transact on line; establish networks to augment their activities in production, consumption, income, expenditure, access to government services and participation in decision making etc. Therefore, it is important to explore the scope for E-Governance strategies to support financial inclusion services and provide synergy.

SAR images are widely accepted and used by many application scientists. However, the SAR images are corrupted with speckle noise. Speckle noises are caused by random interference of electromagnetic signals scattered by the object surface within one resolution element. The amount of noise and distribution of noise corrupting the image is unpredictable. Conventional noise filters are quantitative in nature; they are not well suited for uncertainty problems. Fuzzy logic is capable of handling uncertainty. In this work, noisy pixels in the images are identified by using fuzzy rules and filtered using fuzzy weighted mean, keeping the healthy pixels unchanged. The optimum value of parameters used in defining fuzzy membership function is determined by using genetic algorithm (GA). Reducing noise and simultaneously preserving image details are the two most desirable characteristics of noise filters. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and edge preserving factor (EPF) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy filter. SAR images affected by varying amounts of speckle noise are used to evaluate the performance.

A better approach to reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) in all the three L-L voltages of three-phase multi-level inverters is presented in this paper. It is a fundamental frequency switching strategy where the switching angles can be so selected such that THD in output L-L voltages is minimized to a great extent. In order to obtain most favorable switching angles, an optimisation algorithm using GA is applied to L-L output voltages of three phase multi-level inverters. From three-phase load view point, THD in L-L output voltage of three phase multi-level inverters is a major apprehension when compared to phase voltage. Keeping this in view, optimisation algorithm using GA is applied to L-L voltages (RY, YB, BR) of all the three phases of cascaded multi-level inverters for minimisation of THD. The number of levels in the output will be dynamic and is based on the switching angles chosen and accordingly variations in THD levels too. To support simulation results, hardware for producing triggering pulses of the switches are realized, with the switching times determined by the genetic algorithm and generated using STM32F04 DSP passing through a driver (IR2110) cabinet. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Embedded systems; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Signal processing; Switching; Cascaded multi-level inverters; Fundamental frequency switching; Multilevel inverter; Output voltages; Switching angles; Switching time; Three-phase loads; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

Outputs of the two Flyback sub-parts are connected in series along with the normal Sepic converter output to result in a high positive overall output voltage. The Sepic converter portion acts as a passive clamp to both the Flyback converters. During the switch turn-off instant, the leakage inductor current of the Flyback transformers doesn't get interrupted. Hence, no spike can appear in the drain to source voltage of the switch. Due to the presence of the two transformers as the energy storing elements, the converter can be used for applications requiring higher power handling compared to the conventional Flyback converters.

Generally, due to magnetic limitation, a single Flyback transformer cannot handle high power. Hence, for relatively higher power applications, people prefer the use of interleaved Flyback converter structures. But the interleaved Flyback converter requires the use of two switches. The interesting feature of the proposed converter is that power handling of both the Flyback transformers can be done by a single switch of same voltage rating as that of the conventional interleaved Flyback converter. Hence the solution requires less number of components resulting in a compact and low-cost structure. The voltage rating of the power electronic devices used is much less than the total output voltage in the ideal condition. This results in low conduction loss and high efficiency of voltage step-up conversion. As the output of the two Flyback sub-converters is connected in series to boost the voltage level, the requirement of the turn's ratio of each transformer is less if we compare the turn's ratio requirement of the interleaved Flyback converter used presently. This result in tighter coupling between the windings of the transformer, which reduces the value of the leakage inductance, which causes high losses and unwanted voltage spikes along with radiated noises affecting various part of the circuit and the surrounding. Detailed Explanation of the working of the circuit is given through the modes of operation and a detailed steady-state analysis has been done. The analytical results are verified through the simulations were done using Matlab-Simulink software. © 2016 IEEE.","Active clamp; Converter efficiency; Flyback converter; Leakage energy; Sepic converter","Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Embedded systems; MATLAB; Power converters; Signal processing; Transformer windings; Active clamp; Converter efficiency; Flyback converters; Leakage energies; SEPIC converter; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

Power Transformers are most important and critical component in electrical power transmission and distribution. To have a reliable electricity supply it is necessary to give considerable attention to maintenance of the transformer. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of transformer oil is one of the most effective power transformer condition assessment techniques to diagnose incipient faults. There are many interpretation methods for DGA diagnosis however all these methods rely on personnel expertise more than analytical calculation. As a result, various interpretation techniques do not necessarily indicate to the same result for the same oil sample. Furthermore, substantial number of DGA results fall outside the proposed codes of the existing ratio interpretation methods Furthermore, ratio methods fail to diagnose multiple fault conditions due to the mixing up of produced gases. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a new fuzzy logic approach to reduce reliance on expert personnel and to aid in standardizing DGA interpretation methods. The approach relies on incorporating all existing DGA interpretation methods into one proficient model. DGA results of 100 oil samples that were collected from different transformers of different rating and different life period are used to create the model. Conventional DGA interpretation methods are used to analyse the Together DGA results to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of each interpretation methods. Results of this analysis were then used to develop the proposed fuzzy logic model. © 2016 IEEE.","CIGRE ratio method; CO2 / CO method; Dissolved gas analysis; Dornenburg ratio method; Fuzzy Logic; IEC gas ratio method; Rogers gas ratio method","Computer circuits; Condition monitoring; Dissolution; Embedded systems; Gas chromatography; Gases; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Signal processing; Analytical calculation; Asset Management strategy; CO2 / CO method; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Dissolved gas analysis; Gas ratio; Interpretation methods; Ratio method; Fuzzy logic",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

In transmission system, there is limit for controlling the reactive power in large size power network. In order to manage heavy loading on transmission, load management is necessary to avoid voltage collapse. This paper presents a methodology for load management considering voltage security assessment using probabilistic fuzzy decision tree (PFDT) technique. By using probabilistic fuzzy decision tree method, the load management is calculated in optimal manner in real time and insecure operating conditions are observed. With the help of this method, a real time load management plan could be provided for insecure states significantly assisting the operator to run the system in a secure manner. Probabilistic fuzzy decision tree examines the voltage security of power system whether it is secure or insecure, and classifies it correctly. After classification, voltages of insecure operating conditions are to be made secure by load management on minimal number of buses. The results of proposed method are analyzed on the IEEE-30 bus system and are presented. © 2016 IEEE.","Load shedding; Loadability Margin; PFDT; Voltage Security Margin (VSM)","Decision making; Decision trees; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission; Interoperability; Power control; Sustainable development; Load-shedding; Loadability margins; Monitoring and controlling; PFDT; Real-time load managements; Transmission systems; Voltage security assessment; Voltage security margin; Electric load shedding",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061327,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A 3-axis gantry robot with rodless pneumatic cylinders for actuation and proportional flow control valves was modified to enable experiments on the polishing of steel sheet. An air motor with a buffing wheel was mounted on the Z-axis to provide the polishing action, with the Z-axis cylinder controlling the applied buffing force. Based upon past experience, the FLC for X and Y-axis trajectory control. was supplemented by both system time lag and friction compensators with velocity feedback. In this application, performance is measured by the controller's ability to track a two dimensional shape as well as its ability to minimize the absolute tracking error. Details of the FLC controller including the nature of the membership functions and the rule base are given. Experimental results show that: a) FLC tracks better than a traditional proportional-velocity-differential pressure (PVdP) controller, b) lag and friction compensators are effective and c) the zig-zag trajectory needed for polishing is possible. Future work includes confirming that FLC is more robust than PVdP, in that it should be able to maintain tracking performance as the polishing wheel is applied to the sheet steel, which will generate a variable load. © 2017 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; Pneumatics; Polishing; Tracking","Buffing; Computer circuits; Cylinders (shapes); Friction; Fuzzy logic; Membership functions; Pneumatics; Polishing; Robots; Stiction; Surface discharges; Wheels; Differential pressures; Friction compensator; Fuzzy logic controllers; Pneumatic Cylinders; Proportional flow control valves; Tracking performance; Trajectory control; Velocity feedback; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08407789,9781509055388,CCCEF,,"English","Can Conf Electr Comput Eng",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021807598

It will help industries to develop strategies for managing the SC effectively and ensuring improvement in performance continuously. To achieve this, this work proposes to use a two-phase research methodology. First, 36 SC performance improvement indicators are recognised from a literature survey and from field and industrial expert’s inputs. Secondly, a structural model is proposed using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to prioritise the indicators strategically to improve the SC performance. The fuzzy AHP method helps determine the priority of concerns of the identified indicators under fuzzy surroundings. Inputs in this research are taken from four ancillary Indian plastic manufacturing firms. Research findings indicate that collaborations and information exchange dimension indicators obtained the highest priority in improving SC performance. The model proposed is considered very useful for the SC managers/practitioners/decision-makers to understand better and distinguish the essential SC performance improvement indicators and to take systematic decisions specifically to improve the performance of business in a SC context.

Two properties of online freight exchange makes the decision making challenging for a transporter - highly competitive nature of the market and, uncertainty in availability of consignments. Additionally the driver's return to the home location within a predefined duration is yet another challenge in the decision making process. In order to secure a contract to carry a consignment, a transporter needs to take part in an online auction process. So a transporter needs to take the decision whether to bid for a consignment from the set of available consignments or to wait for some time in order to get a better consignment. We develop an algorithm which recommends the best decision prior to taking part in such an auction. The evaluation results of the proposed algorithm achieves maximized profits and within a pre-decided duration of time - from home location to destination(s) and again back to home - as set by the driver. It also performs better in terms of our objective function when compared with a naive greedy decision making algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer networks; Information systems; Best decision; Decision making process; Decision-making algorithms; Evaluation results; Objective functions; Online auctions; Decision making",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

Photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most focused RES due to plenty than other sources. Before serving to the load, the generated power by solar array is treated electronically and this process is called 'power conditioning'. In power conditioning, two major functions are frequently discussed i.e. DC-AC conversion and maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In order to supply the maximum power to the load, it is desired to operate the solar array at its maximum power point (MPP). Maximum Power Point Tracker automatically and electronically matches the load with the array. There are various techniques to determine the maximum power point. In this paper, one soft computing technique is discussed for this purpose i.e. Fuzzy Logic. With the fuzzy logic based control technique, the duty cycle of the boost converter is controlled in order to obtain the maximum power from PV array.

Cognitive radio designed with single purpose may not be suitable for the next generation of heterogeneous network, where there are multiple QoS requirements on application/user side, experiences a different kind of channel condition and must support different frequency band of transmission. So, there is a need for cognitive radio that will meet the multi-scenario requirements or context aware cognitive radio communication system for the heterogeneous network.

(2) Low data rate FBMC based subcarrier level interleave CR waveform. (3) Emergency communication support underlay spatial coder waveform. (4) Hardware impairment handling waveform using prewhitened precoding. (5) Imperfect channel state handling adaptive training sequence design based interleave CR waveform.

The energy consumption of a head node is higher for it’s maximize utilization. Therefore, the dying process of such nodes is very fast as compared to the other nodes. This problem is called the hot spot problem. To address the hot spot problem, this paper propose a energy efficient cluster based routing protocol using fuzzy logic by employing multi-hop routing technique, where the cluster size is dynamic in nature. To make the dynamic formation of cluster-size, fuzzy logic approach is used and implemented in the protocol.

To perform the experimentation, four input parameters: (i) pulse-on time, (ii) current, (iii) powder concentration, and (iv) powder grain size are considered to investigate the MPCs such as material removal rate, tool wear rate, surface roughness, and micro-hardness. The proposed framework uses response surface methodology (RSM) with gray, gray-fuzzy, and gray-ANFIS approaches to obtain optimal solution and also to handle the element of uncertainty or fuzziness associated with the uncertain, multi-input, and discrete data. This method helps to generate the values of gray relational grade (GRG), gray-fuzzy reasoning grade (GFRG), and gray adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system grade (G-ANFISG) for all the 30 experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on GRG, GFRG, and G-ANFISG to identify the major contributing input parameters which may affect the MPCs. Finally, the theoretical prediction is done to verify the improvement in the performance characteristics obtained through the proposed approaches.

The gestures are captured by Microsoft's Kinect sensor. The work is segmented into four main parts. The first stage describes a “relax” posture through four centroids depicting four portions of the skeletal structure. In the second stage, when the subject is showing symptoms of any one of the 16 physical disorders, then the skeletal structure distorts; the bilateral structure is lost, and concept of “centroid” computation does not seem relevant. Hence, in the second stage, “motion points” depicting shifted centroids for the distorted posture are computed by distance maximization with respect to the four corresponding centroids obtained for the relax posture. This process is carried out by adapting the weights assigned to each joint by differential evolution. In the third stage, eight features are figured out on the basis of Euclidean distances and angles among the motion points of the distorted gesture. In the final stage, gestures are recognized using an interval type-2 fuzzy set-based classifier with 91.37% accuracy. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","differential evolution; gesture recognition; health care applications; hybrid system; interval type-2 fuzzy set; Kinect sensor","Computation theory; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Differential Evolution; Distance maximizations; Euclidean distance; Health care application; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Kinect sensors; Microsoft's kinect; Skeletal structures; Gesture recognition","Saha, S.; Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineering Department, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: sahasriparna@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02664720,,EXSYE,,"English","Expert Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019587348

Such developments are enabling the automation of more and more industrial practices, and are driving the need to replace conventional planning techniques with schemes that can utilize the capabilities of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The future is a place where intelligence is endowed to every entity on the shop floor, and to realize this vision, it is necessary to develop new schemes that can unlock the potential of decentralized data observation and decision-making. Maintenance planning is one such decision-making activity that has evolved over the years to make production more efficient by reducing unplanned downtime and improving product quality. In this work, a distributed algorithm is developed that performs intelligent maintenance planning for identical parallel multi-component machines in a job-shop manufacturing scenario. The algorithm design fits intuitively into the CPS-IIoT paradigm without exacting any additional infrastructure, and is a demonstration of how the paradigm can be effectively deployed. Due to the decentralized nature of the algorithm, its runtime scales with complexity of the problem in terms of number of machines; and the runtime for complex cases is of only a few minutes.

This lack of consequence is a deterrent to cloud adoption for some customers. This paper presents an approach for customers to handle the integrated virtual machine workloads. The fuzzy decision making approach, integer linear programming and cost factors such as strategic decision, selection of cloud computing services and its types are considered in this paper. The fuzzy quantifiers are used for selecting the number of virtual machines in the environment and it optimizes the demand of the cloud resources in distributed environment.

The importance of service quality grading is apparent with increasing demand to meet the customer needs in highly competitive service-related industry. However, it is not always straightforward as the constraints in grading processes and customer perceptions towards services are intangible measures. This paper presents the grading for service quality of four vehicle insurance companies using intuitionistic fuzzy weighted information measure. The IFWIM is useful to represent the decision information in the process of decision-making since it was characterized by degrees of membership, non-membership and hesitation. The crisp survey results were collected via questionnaires from customers of the selected region and analysed using the IFWIM. These grading results would be useful for insurance companies in upgrading their service quality and eventually able to fulfil customers’ needs. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Exponential information; Information measure; Intuitionistic fuzzy set; Intuitionistic fuzzy weight averaging operator; Service quality","Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Insurance; Quality of service; Sales; Surveys; Exponential information; Information measures; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Service Quality; Grading","Jain, D.; Department of Mathematics, JUETIndia; email: divya.jain@juet.ac.in",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,,"English","Int.

Analyzing all these databases is one of the difficult tasks in the medical environment. In order to warehouse all these databases and to analyze the patient's condition, we need an efficient data mining technique. In this paper, an efficient data mining technique for warehousing clinical databases using Rough Set Theory (RST) and Fuzzy Logic is proposed. Our proposed methodology contains two phases - (i) Clustering and (ii) Classification. In the first phase, Rough Set Theory is used for clustering. Clustering is one of the data mining techniques for warehousing the heterogeneous data bases. Clustering technique is used to group data that have similar characteristics in the same cluster and also to group the data that have dissimilar characteristics with other clusters. After clustering the data, similar objects will be clustered in one cluster and the dissimilar objects will be clustered under another cluster. The RST can be reduced the complexity. Then in the second phase, these clusters are classified using Fuzzy Logic. Normally, Classification with Fuzzy Logic is generated more number of rules. Since the RST is utilized in our work, the classification using Fuzzy can be done with less amount of complexity. The proposed approach is evaluated using various clinical related databases from heart disease datasets - Cleveland, Switzerland and Hungarian. The performance analysis is based on Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy with different cluster numbers. The experimentation results show that our proposed methodology provides better accuracy result. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","classification; clustering; Data mining; fuzzy logic; rough set theory; warehousing","Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Data mining; Database systems; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Medical computing; Set theory; Warehouses; clustering; Clustering techniques; Heterogeneous data; Large amounts of data; Medical conditions; Performance analysis; Rough set theory (RST); warehousing; Rough set theory",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

The PSS is added to an excitation system to enhance the damping during low-frequency oscillations. In this paper, the system is analysed for fuzzy logic power system stabilizer (FPSS) with different membership functions (MFs). The speed deviation (Δ ω) and acceleration (Δ ω˙) of the rotor of a synchronous generator are taken as the input to the fuzzy logic controller to improve small signal stability by enhancing damping. The effect of these variables on damping at the generator shaft mechanical oscillation is very significant. The stabilizing signals were computed using the different fuzzy membership functions in the Mamdani inference system. The general membership functions under consideration are triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian, bell, sigmoid and polynomial types. The performance of the fuzzy logic PSS with different membership functions is compared to get best-suited MF to design an FPSS. The best-performing MF is found based on simulation study with both power systems and with varying no. of linguistic variables as well. It is found that, If the number of linguistic variables is 3 or 5, the preferred best-suited membership function appears as the Gaussian type, while with increased linguistic variables as 7 or above, then the triangular MF is preferable as the performance is better in comparison with Gaussian MF. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Membership function; Power system stabilizer; Single-machine infinite bus system; Small signal stability","Computer circuits; Damping; Electric generators; Energy transfer; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Gaussian distribution; Linguistics; System stability; Fuzzy logic power system stabilizer; Fuzzy membership function; Low frequency oscillations; Power System Stabilizer; Power system stabilizers; Single machine infinite bus; Single machine infinite bus system; Small signal stability; Membership functions","Sambariya, D.K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Rajasthan Technical UniversityIndia; email: dsambariya_2003@yahoo.com",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,,"English","Int.

Consumption of transmission energy of nodes that are deployed far away from base station (BS) increases with increase in distance. To prolong the network lifetime, the selection of cluster heads (CH) plays a crucial role. This paper proposes an enhanced zone stable election protocol based on fuzzy logic for cluster head election. The studies on ZSEP-E have assumed probabilistic election of cluster heads in the zones taking into consideration the maximum residual energy of the nodes lacking the studies on diverse parameters for cluster head election. In this paper, fuzzy logic is adapted to ZSEP-E to evaluate the cluster head selection probability taking into account the factors such as residual energy of the node, density, and distance to the base station.

In this paper a novel Fuzzy Document based Information Retrieval Model (FDIRM) is proposed for the purpose of Stock Market Index forecasting. The novelty of proposed approach is a modified tf-idf scoring scheme to predict the future trend of the stock market index. The contribution of this paper has two dimensions, 1) In the proposed system the simple time series is converted to an enriched fuzzy linguistic time series with a unique approach of incorporating market sentiment related information along with the price and 2) A unique approach is followed while modeling the information retrieval (IR) system which converts a simple IR system into a forecasting system. From the performance comparison of FDIRM with standard benchmark models it can be affirmed that the proposed model has a potential of becoming a good forecasting model.

First, we present a ranking method developed by relative preference index which we define using generalized credibility measure to rank interval type-2 fuzzy variables. Then, based on the proposed ranking method, we develop a new method to solve fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (FMCGDM) problems where linguistic ratings of the alternatives and the criteria weights are represented by interval type-2 fuzzy variables. The proposed FMCGDM method is applied to a transportation mode selection problem to find most preferable mode among available modes based on some selection criteria. The proposed method is simple in computation and important as it uses interval type-2 fuzzy variables which are more reasonable and sensible to represent linguistic terms rather than by type-1 fuzzy variables. A numerical experiment has been done to illustrate the proposed method. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making; Generalized credibility; Interval type-2 fuzzy variable; Ranking fuzzy variables; Transportation mode selection","Computational linguistics; Linguistics; Numerical methods; Transportation; Fuzzy variable; Generalized credibility; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Multi criteria group decision making; Transportation mode; Decision making","Kar, S.; Department of Mathematics, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kar_s_k@yahoo.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951979379

Due to the distinct characteristics, they are vulnerable to many attacks. To secure WSN, trust management plays a pertinent role. In trust based security model, decision is taken based on some specific behavior, and so it has uncertainty. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty and has tolerance of imprecise data with high power of precision. In this study, fuzzy logic based multi-attribute trust model is suggested. The proposed trust model has message success rate, elapsed time at node, correctness and fairness as trust metrics. Once the four trust values are calculated, fuzzy computational theory is applied to compute the final trust value of every node that can be anyone of low (l), medium (m) and high (h). Simulation results show that the fuzzy based multi-attribute trust evaluation outperforms weighted summation based multi-attribute trust evaluation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fuzzy logic; Multi-attribute trust model (MATM); Security; Trust model; Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Network security; Reconfigurable hardware; Security of data; Sensor nodes; Computational theories; Malicious node detections; Security; Trust management; Trust modeling; Trust-based security; Weighted summations; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Ram Prabha, V.; CSE Department, VV College of EngineeringIndia; email: prabhasuresh.v@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986322568

Analysis of the gene expression data reveals that not all but few important genes are responsible for the diseases. However, the DNA microarray data set usually contain multiple missing value and therefore, selection of important genes using the incomplete data set may be erroneous, resulting misclassification in disease prediction. In the paper we propose an integrated framework, which first imputes the missing value and then in order to achieve maximum accuracy in classifying the patients a classifier has been designed to select the genes using the complete microarray data set. Here functionally similar genes are employed to estimate the missing value unlike the existing gene expression value based distance similarity measure. However, the functionally similar genes may differ in their protein production capacity and so the degree of similarity between the genes varies from gene to gene. The problem has been dealt by proposing a novel method to impute the missing value using the concept of fuzzy similarity. After imputing the missing value, the continuous gene expression matrix is discretized using fuzzy sets to distinguish the activation levels of different genes. The proposed fuzzy importance factor (FIf) of each gene represents its activation level or protein production capacity both in the disease and normal class. The importance of each gene is evaluated while optimizing the number of rules in the fuzzy classifier depending on the FIf. The methodology we propose has been demonstrated using nine different cancer data sets and compared with the state of the art methods. Analysis of experimental results reveals that the proposed framework able to classify the diseased and normal patients with improved accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DNA microarray; Fuzzy rule base classifier; Fuzzy similarity; Gene selection; Impute missing value","Chemical activation; Classification (of information); DNA; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Genes; Proteins; DNA micro-array; Fuzzy rule base; Fuzzy similarity; Gene selection; Missing values; Gene expression","Paul, A.; Computer Science and Engineering of St. Thomas’ College of Engineering and Technology, Kidderpore, India; email: amitpaul83@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

At the beginning of each cycle a price discount is offered for a period to boost the demand. During this period, demand increases with time depending upon the amount of discount. Here, demand also depends on the unit selling price. After withdrawal of the price discount, demand depends only on the unit selling price. The governing differential equation for the model is obviously fuzzy in nature as the production rate and demand are fuzzy. For this reason, the model is formulated using a fuzzy differential equation and the α-cut of the total profit from the planning horizon is obtained using fuzzy Riemann integration. To optimize the interval objective function, using a fuzzy preference relation on intervals and a fuzzy possibility/necessity measure, a hybrid algorithm with varying population size is developed by combining the features of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a genetic algorithm (GA). This algorithm is named Interval Compared Hybrid Particle Swarm-Genetic Algorithm (ICHPSGA) and is used to find an optimal decision for the decision maker (DM) in different cases of the model. To test the efficiency of the algorithm, it is compared with two other established algorithms namely PSO and PSGA.

While developing and testing such converters, it is difficult to test them with actually installed PV panels owing to unavailability of practical onsite conditions for all the time. For such cases, PV simulators are preferred, which are required to exhibit PV system behavior under working conditions without the use of real outdoor installation. This reduces the time and cost of experimentation. In this paper, a real-Time PV simulator based on a DC-DC buck converter is investigated to obtain true PV characteristics. The practical difficulty with PV simulators is that they often get oscillations in the constant current region or constant voltage region of PV characteristics, particularly when the controller is designed using a low-cost digital controller. This paper introduces a novel hysteresis controller to ensure effective operation in both these regions. This dual control strategy ensures effective control in both regions and provides smooth trajectories as per mathematical model or lookup table to mimic any PV characteristics under various temperatures and insolations with the use of the low-cost digital controller. The hardware prototype is constructed with the digital signal controller to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed simulator. © 2003-2010 IEEE Canada.","DC-DC converter; digital signal controller; photovoltaic (PV); pulsewidth modulation; simulator","Controllers; Costs; Electric inverters; Photovoltaic cells; Pulse width modulation; Simulators; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Table lookup; DC-DC buck converter; Digital controllers; Digital signal controllers; Hysteresis controller; On-site conditions; Photovoltaic; Smooth trajectories; Solar photovoltaics; DC-DC converters","Shinde, U.K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Bhivarabai Sawant College of Engineering and ResearchIndia; email: ukshinde@yahoo.com",,"IEEE Canada",08408688,,CJEEE,,"English","Can J Electr Comput Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030725268

In order to enhance the privacy among group members, proper group key management schemes can be used to encrypt and decrypt the payload. This management is serious task in flexible network like MANET due to dynamic node movement and limited available resources. In order to get away from repeated group key refreshment for entire large network, rekeying done only for sub networks known as clusters. To cope up in this situation, the integrated approach of fuzzy trust based clustering (FTBC) and hierarchical distributed group key management is proposed in this paper. The FTBC isolate misbehaving node from legitimate data transmission and also categorize trusted and distrusted nodes by applying fuzzy logic rules.

A Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is adopted for the neural networks and the sampled-data fuzzy controller is designed for a T–S fuzzy system. To develop the guaranteed cost control, a new stability condition of the closed-loop system is guaranteed in the continuous-time Lyapunov sense, and its sufficient conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. By using a descriptor representation, the sampled-data fuzzy control system with time delay can be reduced to ease the stability analysis, which effectively leads to a smaller number of LMI-stability conditions. Information of the membership functions of both the fuzzy plant model and fuzzy controller are considered, which allows arbitrary matrices to be introduced, to ease the satisfaction of the stability conditions. By a newly proposed inequality bounding technique, the fuzzy sampled-data filtering performance analysis is carried out such that the resultant neural networks is asymptotically stable.

Data loss as a result of massive transmission over such degraded link significantly affects the network lifetime. Therefore, this work proposes link quality based adaptive data streaming as a solution for effective deployment of low power Zigbee. Initially to determine the quality using RSSI and LQI indicator, an enhanced link quality estimation technique (ELQET) is designed with an intuitive combination of the Kalman filter and fuzzy logic. The quality score returned by fuzzy utilizing four efficient link metrics PRR, ASNR, ALQI, and SA is further smoothened with exponential weighted moving average filter for stability. Consequently the estimated quality is categorized into good/poor quality to stream data at high/low transmission rate respectively between the LPC2148s via CC2550 transceiver. Here, two contrasting RSSI and LQI data sets are furnished as input to ELQET and categorized into good link with quality of about 61 % and poor link with a quality of about 50 %. The straight forward low computation technique is WSN propitious and exhibits high performance with RMSE of 0.0133.

To bring these paradigms to life, self-sustainable wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes capable of seamless and maintenance free operation at remote locations are desired. Recently, radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) circuits capable of harvesting RF power transmitted by base stations, TV towers and other ambient RF sources have been developed. Low power requirements and architectural compatibility between WSN nodes and RFEH circuits make RFEH a promising and feasible solution for WSN nodes. In this paper, a novel multi-stage decision-making policy (DMP) for RFEH enabled WSN nodes has been proposed. It offers an intelligence, via online learning algorithm, for characterization and selection of frequency bands based on their RF potential especially in the dynamic spectrum environment. Furthermore, proposed DMP supports multi-antenna multi-band harvesting capabilities of the RFEH circuits. The final contribution includes tunable RFEH duration that leads to significant improvement in the harvested energy and fewer number of frequency band switchings (FBS). Derived theoretical performance bounds and simulation results validate the superiority of proposed DMP in terms of the harvested RF energy and throughput of the WSN nodes. Furthermore, the fewer number of FBS makes the proposed DMP suitable for resource-constrained WSN nodes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor nodes","Decision making; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Low power electronics; Smart city; Wireless sensor networks; Architectural compatibility; Distributed decision making; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Online learning algorithms; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor node; Sensor nodes","Darak, S.J.; ECE DepartmentIndia; email: sumit@iiitd.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019889674

The statistical classifiers used in these data fusion approaches are also transformed by integrating the contextual information from neighboring pixels, to improve the accuracy of a fuzzy-logic-based fusion scheme. A decision level fusion approach was developed by Gokaraju et. al, 2012, which combines statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Here, each data sample is integrated through separate classifiers such as empirical methods and support vector machines (SVMs) and then used a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to fuse the decisions for a unified consensus decision. The data fusion approach consists of either pixel-level or feature-level data fusion in combination with machine learning techniques for classification. The intermediate results of the disaster management studies, such as levee land-slide and tornado debris assessment using data fusion techniques, are presented in this paper. For levee landslide studies, we used the multi-temporal datasets of air-borne synthetic aperture radar sensor (UAVSAR).

Multicasting is a mechanism to send a data packet from one node to a group of receivers node at a time. There are various challenges in a MANET due to dynamic network topology and limited resources. Since the network performance metrics such as delay, bandwidth and energy changes very frequently due to node mobility i.e. these network metrics have the uncertainty issues in a wireless mobile ad-hoc network. The impact of these uncertainty issues creates a problem in the selection of optimal path from source node to a group of receiver nodes. So, in this paper, we have tried to control these uncertainties issues in order to conserve the network resources using fuzzy logic tool. In this mechanism all the available network metrics of the routes is converted into a single metric i.e. fuzzy cost or communication cost. The routes having minimum fuzzy cost will be considered as optimal path and the data is to be transmitted over this path from source node to a set of receivers.

In management science, a closely related class of problems, popularly known as group decision making, is often addressed. Unfortunately, majority of the algorithms developed for this purpose work for binary or multiple opinions without taking care of the semantic meaning of the options. Moreover, group decision considers a feedback set comprising range of continuous values unlike the judgment analysis problem.

This paper discusses about safety practice index calculation using multi grade fuzzy approach. A conceptual model has been developed for calculation of safety index. Usage of Fuzzy logic gives a unique advantage of being compatible and having a clear quantitative computation avoiding bias. Factors which affect the safety level of an organization is identified. Major impacting factors include organizational commitment and information integration. Usage of computational techniques in manufacturing organization makes information available to every employee in organization transparently. Research scope is limited to current manufacturing standards which are on practice and addition of variables can be done accordingly to change in practice standards. A case study test is computed to a manufacturing organization to ensure the effectiveness of the formulation. It revealed most important factor in driving safety level of organization is their auditing procedures. Improvement actions for the organization under study are also proposed. Although there is adequate facilities available to enhance safety practice in manufacturing organization, implementation of safety practices is most important and difficult process. © 2016 IEEE.","continuous improvement; industrial safety; multigrade fuzzy; safety practice index","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Fuzzy logic; Manufacture; Risk management; Safety factor; Computational technique; Continuous improvements; Information integration; Manufacturing organizations; Multigrade; Organizational Commitment; Safety practices; Traditional manufacturing; Industrial research",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A simulation (using MATLAB/Simulink) study has been made on input single line to ground fault and inverter base drive open fault. The speed and accuracy of the fault diagnosis requires signal analysis using Digital Signal Processors. The signal analysis algorithms such as Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transforms are studied and compared. Current research is exploring on Expert Systems for fault diagnosis due to the dominant usage of power electronics drives in traction, ships, aerospace, elevators, conveyers and military applications. In the above systems, the advanced diagnosing techniques are essential to avoid inadvertent shutdown and to sustain fault tolerant mode of operation. Also, the VFDs are used as energy efficient devices in many industrial applications such as industrial grade air compressors, etc., and techniques for neutralizing the pulsating torque under faulty single phase mode of three phase induction motor are discussed. The simulation study using FFT and Wavelets for detecting faults has been done along with analysis, for knowledge on fault detection is most important to protect with upgraded system and to improve the reliability of solid state drives.

With the burgeoning advancement and application of Association Rule Mining in diverse fields ranging from the web usage mining to medical diagnosis and business intelligence to geographical information systems, the decision-making in ARM involves a multi-objective perspective to obtain an interesting and accurate rule set. By considering the Pareto optimality, an optimal trade-off is established between the conflicting and incommensurate performance parameters-comprehensibility, interestingness and confidence of the mined rules. Both, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), being population-based stochastic search method, have found their strong base in mining association rules. We propose an association rule mining scheme using our proposed multi-objective hybridisation of GA-PSO algorithm. The primary advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the hybridisation of multiple objective-GA with multi objective-PSO balances the exploration and exploitation tasks, resulting in valuable extraction of accurate and interpretable mined rules. Evaluating this hybrid model on Bakery dataset shows that with generation of comprehensible, interesting and reliable association rules, the model also converges four times faster than mono-objective hybridisation. © 2016 IEEE.","Association Rule Mining; Genetic Algorithm; Hybrid NSGA-II-MOPSO; Hybridisation; Multi-Objective Optimization; Pareto optimality; Particle Swarm Optimisation","Artificial intelligence; Association rules; Decision making; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Medical information systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stochastic systems; Association rule minings (ARM); Exploration and exploitation; Hybridisation; NSGA-II; Pareto-optimality; Particle swarm optimisation; Performance parameters; Stochastic search methods; Data mining",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This paper is useful in robust decision-making for the system operator. The main disadvantage of meta-heuristic-based MOO approach is computationally burdensome. The motivation of this paper is to overcome this drawback. By using the proposed efficient MOO approach, the number of load flows to be performed is reduced substantially, resulting to the solution speed up. Here, three objective functions, i.e., generator fuel cost minimization, loss minimization, and L index minimization are considered. The proposed approach can effectively handle the complex non-linearities, discontinuities, discrete variables, and multiple objectives. The potential and suitability of the proposed efficient MOO approach is tested on the IEEE 30 bus system. The results obtained with the proposed efficient MOO approach are also compared with the meta-heuristic-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-2 (NSGA-II) technique.

Basically the use of PV cells in solar energy generation are widely used because they directly convert the sun's light into electrical energy. The main drawback is that the solar radiation changes with time to time. So there are many maximum power point tracking algorithms to track maximum power point. One of the most widely used algorithm is perturb and observe algorithm. It has advantage of less complexity and less maintenance. But the problem is that this algorithm cannot perform due to sudden change in temperature and solar irradiance. Therefore there is an algorithm which is called improved perturb and observe or variable step size algorithm which overcomes the drawbacks of conventional perturb and observe algorithm.

The Abdominal signal consist of fetal ECG, non-linear transformed version of M-ECG and random noises associated with the signal. The proposed method uses Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (AN-FIS) from soft computing field for finding the non-linearity between the two maternal signals recorded from abdomen and thorax area of mother skin.

It has been exhibited that the omega ratio optimization is equivalent to a linear program under a mild condition and thus easily tractable. But the omega ratio optimization fails to hedge against many other risks involved in portfolio return that may adversely affect the interests of a risk-averse investor. On the other hand, there are widely accepted mean-risk models for portfolio selection that seek to maximize mean return and minimize the associated risk but in general fail to maximize the relative performance ratio around the threshold return. In this paper, we aim to propose a model called ‘extended omega ratio optimization’ that combines the features of the omega ratio optimization model and mean-risk models. The proposed model introduces constraint on a general risk function in the omega ratio optimization model in such a way that the resultant model remains linear and thus tractable. Our empirical experience with real data from S&P BSE sensex index shows that the optimal portfolios from the extended omega ratio optimization model(s) improved over the optimal portfolios from the omega ratio optimization in having less associated risk and over the optimal portfolios from the corresponding mean-risk model(s) in having a high value omega ratio. © 2015 The Authors.

It achieves enhanced performance over On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP). The proposed protocol finds energy efficient multicast routes from source node to a group of receivers. Multicast mesh creation involves two phases: a Join Query (J-Q) phase and a Join Reply (J-R) phase. The J-Q phase initiates a route discovery process to find routes of the multicast group. In J-R phase, different routes of the multicast groups are set up. In the proposed protocol, we modify ODMRP and introduce fuzzy inference system to deal with imprecise and partial information during the route discovery phase. The decision maker uses two fuzzy variables such as energy and distance for evaluating reward as an output parameter of each multicast route. This output parameter helps to distinguish different multicast route and it also helps to reduce the effect of mutual interference between routes. The proposed protocol is simulated using the NS-2 simulator. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with existing multicast routing protocols, and results outperform existing protocols in terms of several network metrics. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ad-hoc networks; Energy efficient; Fuzzy logic; Multicast routing","Ad hoc networks; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Internet protocols; Multicasting; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Energy efficient; Fuzzy inference systems; Multicast routing; Multicast routing protocol; Mutual interference; On-demand multicast routing protocols; Partial information; Route discovery process; Network routing","Das, S.K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology (ISM)India; email: sunsantosh2007@rediffmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",19366442,,,,"English","Peer-to-Peer Netw.

Turbulence is important because it mixes and churns the atmosphere and causes the water vapour, smoke, and other substances. Turbulence near the Earth's surface differ from that at higher levels. Atmospheric turbulence can degrade the performance of free-space optical links, particularly over ranges of the order of 1 km or longer. In this paper, we address the problem of optimum signal detection for the channel-aided free-space optics.

The purpose of this paper will be Smart Grid interoperability and standards relevant to the Indian context, development of indigenous low-cost smart solutions. In advance metering infrastructure we will be aiming to monitor the real time consumption of electricity through IOT and provide necessary control over the consumption. In this we will also find solution for black-out management by providing some bug correction from the service centers to the domestic consumers. In peak load management system currently we are providing total power cut for all types of loads, instead of that we can have two separate connections for light loads and power loads. At the peak time we can cut the power only for power load and provide supply to light loads. By doing this we can avoid the use of inverters for domestic purposes. Inverters are having a major drawback as it consumes more power and will deliver only less power as output. Since most of the domestic consumers are having inverters, power cut is of no use. So by implementing peak load management (PMS) some solution can be provided for this problem. If in case there is an urgent requirement of power for some appliances and the consumer is willing to pay extra money at peak load time then they can get High power loads with additional cost.The consumer can login to the consumer page provided by the electricity board and agree for paying extra money at peak load time or otherwise with the additionally provided breaker in the circuit which can be manually turn on during the peak load time consumer can have this benefit but on additional charges. © 2016 IEEE.","Load management; Peak load; Theft","Advanced metering infrastructures; Crime; Electric inverters; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Integrated circuits; Domestic purpose; Light loads; Management systems; Peak load; Service center; Smart solutions; Theft; Theft detections; Outages",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

The videos of six different types of flow patterns namely, annular flow, bubble flow, churn flow, plug flow, slug flow and stratified flow are recorded for a period and converted to 2D images for processing. The textural and shape features extracted using image processing are applied as inputs to various classification schemes namely fuzzy logic, SVM and SVM with PCA in order to identify the type of flow pattern.

The incorporation of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC) with fractional controller of PID-type is investigated for time response measure due to both unit step response and unit load disturbance. The resulting IT2FO-FPID controller is examined on different delayed linear and nonlinear benchmark plants followed by robustness analysis. In order to design this controller, fractional order integrator-differentiator operators are considered as design variables including input-output scaling factors. A new hybridized algorithm named as artificial bee colony-genetic algorithm (ABC-GA) is used to optimize the parameters of the controller while minimizing weighted sum of integral of time absolute error (ITAE) and integral of square of control output (ISCO). To assess the comparative performance of the IT2FO-FPID, authors compared it against existing controllers, i.e., interval type-2 fuzzy PID (IT2-FPID), type-1 fractional order fuzzy PID (T1FO-FPID), type-1 fuzzy PID (T1-FPID), and conventional PID controllers. Furthermore, to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, the perturbed processes along with the larger dead time are tested. Moreover, the proposed controllers are also implemented on multi input multi output (MIMO), coupled, and highly complex nonlinear two-link robot manipulator system in presence of un-modeled dynamics. Finally, the simulation results explicitly indicate that the performance of the proposed IT2FO-FPID controller is superior to its conventional counterparts in most of the cases. © 2017 ISA","Fractional order controller; Hybridized ABC-GA algorithm; Interval type-2 fuzzy PID controller; Robustness testing; Type-1 fuzzy PID controller","Controllers; Electric control equipment; Feedback control; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Manipulators; MIMO systems; Optimization; Robot applications; Three term control systems; Fractional-order controllers; Fuzzy PID controller; GA algorithm; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Robustness testing; Proportional control systems","Kumar, A.; Indian Institute of Technology, Department of Electronics and communication EngineeringIndia; email: anuanu1616@gmail.com",,"ISA - Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society",00190578,,ISATA,,"English","ISA Trans",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016439401

Wireless sensor networks are mainly characterized by their limited amount of energy and memory. Constructing a network with this kind of sensor will lead to additional challenges with energy and memory constraints of wireless sensor network. The success of the wireless sensor network is mainly depends on maximum lifetime with high quality of services (QoS). Clustering is one of widely used technique to increase the lifetime of the network by utilizing energy in an efficient manner. In clustering each sensor node reported to it is Cluster Head (CH). Data fusion is an important QoS parameter when forming multi-model based wireless sensor networks. In this network, multi-model sensor nodes sensed different features and formed long message that are sent to CH. In this paper, it is proposed a fuzzy based data fusion method named Efficient Fuzzy Logic based Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks (EFLDF). The primary goal of this paper is to increase the QoS in terms of data accuracy, eliminating data redundancy and increase the networks lifetime. This proposed method has three level fuzzy inference System (FIS) to improve QoS.

Extracting this information to guide decision making in a national security perspective remains a challenging task. The major issue arises due to a large amount of irrelevant information or complexity of unstructured data which makes information extraction and classification a very tedious task while analyzing the textual content for finding various aspects of entities or groups. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards introducing a context-based information extraction using National Security Information Sources (NSIS) which employs different types of knowledge inspired by natural activities of living things. In order to improve classification performance by utilizing relevant information from the sources related to national security and to make better decision, we assume that entities and relationships from these sources can be used to contextualize information from the records. This paper presents a new method for nature-inspired classification after extracting various features from dataset created using social posts and records. Then, analysis of classes of information to concepts available on knowledge sources is carried out to ensure quality of information based on the user needs. The simulation results demonstrated the ability of the proposed method inspired by cultural algorithm to extract group-centric information and improve classification performance using proposed Social Info Finder (SIF).

In order to achieve this objective, a simulation-based framework is needed for evaluation of decision-making policies in procurement context. In this research we propose a Multi-Agent System framework, specifically considering the Indian scenario of paddy procurement operations. We formally define procurement, allocation, milling and scheduling agents under this context and explicitly state the interaction protocols and related algorithms. Procurement agents solve the problem of allocation and maximum coverage to strategically determine their locations. An Improvised Contract Net Protocol is implemented by allocation agents to either reorganize excess procurement quantities among procurement agents or tag to milling agents who implicitly engender disturbance in the system.

More than 45% of required energy in the world will be generated by photovoltaic arrays. Therefore it is imperative to have focus on reduction of costs as well as on enhancing the efficiency of PV array. In order to carry out the latter part, Maximum Power Point Tracking Technique (MPPT) is used to improve the power output from solar array. With a proper review of the reported techniques, this paper attempts to take out the bewilderment while selecting a MPPT by a comparative review on most of the widely adopted MPPT algorithms such as P&O, Incremental Conductance, Fuzzy Logic and PSO, as every technique has its own merits and demerits. Their performance is evaluated using MATLAB and the results are compared for different types of MPPT algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.","Maximum power point tracking techniques; Photovoltaic array; PSO and Fuzzy Logic; SEPIC Converter","Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Integrated circuits; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; Tracking (position); Incremental conductance; Maximum power point tracking techniques; Mppt algorithms; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaic systems; Power out put; Primary energy source; SEPIC converter; Maximum power point trackers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

Low resolution in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) coronary videos poses a threat to calcium detection causing over-estimation in volume measurement. We introduce a correction block that counter-balances the bias introduced during the calcium detection process. Method Nineteen patients image dataset (around 40,090 frames), IRB approved, were collected using 40 MHz IVUS catheter (Atlantis® SR Pro, Boston Scientific®, pullback speed of 0.5 mm/sec). A new set of 20 generalized and well-balanced systems each consisting of three stages: (i) calcium detection, (ii) calibration and (iii) measurement, while ensuring accuracy of four soft classifiers (Threshold, FCM, K-means and HMRF) and workflow speed using five multiresolution techniques (bilinear, bicubic, wavelet, Lanczos, Gaussian Pyramid) were designed. Results of the three calcium detection methods were benchmarked against the Threshold-based method. Results All 20 well-balanced systems with calibration block show superior performance. Using calibration block, FCM versus Threshold-based method shows the highest cross-correlation 0.99 (P<0.0001), Jaccard index 0.984±0.013 (P<0.0001), and Dice similarity 0.992±0.007 (P<0.0001). The corresponding area under the curve for four calcium detection techniques is: 1.0, 1.0, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. The mean overall performance improvement is 38.54% and when adapting calibration block. The mean workflow speed improvement is 62.14% when adapting multiresolution paradigm. Three clinical tests shows consistency, reliability, and stability of our well-balanced system. Conclusions A well-balanced system with a combination of Threshold embedded with Lanczos multiresolution was optimal and can be useable in clinical settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Calibration; Classification; Coronary calcium volume; Low-resolution IVUS; Multiresolution; Speed","Calcium; Classification (of information); Heart; Image segmentation; Speed; Titration; Ultrasonic applications; Volume measurement; Coronary calcium; Intravascular ultrasound; Low resolution; Multi-resolution techniques; Multiresolution; Multiresolution paradigms; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Quantitative assessments; Calibration; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; coronary calcium detection; coronary calcium volume; female; human; intravascular ultrasound; intravascular ultrasound catheter; kernel method; male; priority journal; workflow; algorithm; blood vessel calcification; calibration; computer assisted diagnosis; computer interface; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; fuzzy logic; interventional ultrasonography; middle aged; procedures; videorecording; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Calibration; Coronary Vessels; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Ultrasonography, Interventional; User-Computer Interface; Vascular Calcification; Video Recording","Suri, J.S.; Monitoring and Diagnostic Division, AtheroPoint™United States; email: Jasjit.Suri@atheropoint.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00104825,,CBMDA,"28390284","English","Comput.

Execution of computation intensive or resource intensive task to be done locally on CPU and remotely on cloud, which provide a highly versatile execution platform for mobile or android applications. We conduct a real world application for finding road roughness, in order to measure the performance of CODMF. When the task demands maximum energy consumption and time, task will be shifted to the cloud.

As a result, the urban population has to invest more time in traveling. Increased road traffic results in an increased number of road accidents and more consumption of fuel, thus wasting energy. Hence for solving this issue, this paper proposes a traffic signal synchronization system which takes real time traffic signal data as input and with the implementation of multi-agent fuzzy logic, it introduces the design of an intelligent system which would smoothen the overall road traffic of the city. Fuzzy system is capable of handling the various levels of uncertainties found in the input data taken from the traffic signals.

Users express their opinion through the reviews. These reviews are used by the individuals and organizations for decision making purpose. It is impossible to read and extract user opinions from such huge number of reviews manually. To solve such problem an automated opinion mining approach is required. It is difficult for a user to read and understand all the reviews. Relevant and important information about these establishments should be fetched from reviews and presented to user in a summarized manner. Current approaches for opinion mining, attempts to detect the polarity of a sentence, paragraph or text regardless of the aspects mentioned in it.

It learns patterns in terms of n-dimensional hyper line segment (HLS). Modified fuzzy hyperline segment neural network (MFHLSNN) is a modified version of FHLSNN that improves the quality of reasoning and recall time per pattern using modified fuzzy membership function. However, for the large training patterns MFHLSNN creates a large number of HLS, which increases training and recall time and thus, is limited only to smaller dataset on sequential machines/implementations. In this paper, we proposed a new fuzzy membership function for MFHLSNN. Using new membership function architecture is called Updated FHLSNN (UFHLSNN). We also proposed GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel implementation of UFHLSNN, for larger pattern datasets, using NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The updated membership function is found superior than the original one, in terms of number of arithmetic operations. The maximum speed-up achieved in training and recognition phases are 12× and 29×, respectively for the used datasets.

The degree of compensation is dependent on the tranquility and anxiety level experienced by the decision-maker while taking the decision. Higher tranquility leads to the higher realisation of the compensation whereas the increased level of anxiety reduces the amount of compensation in the decision process. This work determines the level of tranquility (or anxiety) using the concept of fuzzy sets and its various level sets. The concepts of indexing of fuzzy numbers, the risk barriers and the tranquility level of the decision-maker are used to derive his/her risk prone or risk averse attitude of decision-maker in each criterion. The aggregation of the risk levels in each criterion gives us the amount of compensation in the entire MCDM problem. Inclusion of the compensation leads us to model the MCDM problem as binary integer programming problem (BIP). The solution to BIP gives us the compensatory decision to MCDM.

Apart from greater fault tolerance compared to three phase, a six phase machine enables the use of low voltage devices for the inverter. Also the inverter used here is a three phase nine level stacked inverter which itself uses low voltage devices. Thus MOSFETs can be used for the inverter. The nine level inverter is formed by stacking 2 five level inverters each of which is developed by cascading an FC and a capacitor fed H-bridge. The inverter can be stacked further to obtain still higher number of voltage levels. This enables the use of batteries at the front end and still lower voltage devices which will significanly improve the efficiency. Hence this will find applications in electric vehicles because of the direct battery drive. Experiment is conducted on a 15 KW six phase IM by reconfiguring it as a three phase machine and driven by the three phase nine level stacked inverter using V/f control scheme.

The advantages of multilevel inverters include low electromagnetic interference (EMI) outputs, low power dissipation, low harmonic etc. The most common multilevel inverter topology is cascaded H-bridge topology constituted by IGBT semiconductors. The most common switching technology used is SPWM to obtain staircase voltage waveform. This staircase waveform contains harmonics and fundamental component. The requirement of satisfying the fundamental component is that all harmonics should be removed. The higher order harmonics can be easily removed by using filters. But lower order harmonics cannot be easily eliminated. For removing lower order harmonics non-linear transcendental equations derived from fourier series expansion should be solved. Solution to these equations can be found out by using computing methods. This paper presents a different approach, which is a advanced computing method i.e. Ant Colony Optimization method. By using ACO elimination of lower order harmonics is possible. The results shows 3rd, 5th, 7th harmonics are eliminated whereas THD is also reduced.

In this article, we study an interactive genetic algorithm based multiobjective fuzzy clustering technique for satellite im-age clustering problem. The algorithm simultaneously finds the clustering solution as well as evolves the set of validity measures that are to be optimized simultaneously.

The use of a 4-phase SRM drive minimizes the torque ripple and increases the number of strokes without incrementing the number of rotor poles. The low number of switches in a mid-point converter used to energize SRM phases further enhances the performance of the system. The speed control of the motor using the pulse width modulation (PWM) switching of split-capacitor converter eliminates the requirement of additional sensors on the motor to control its speed.

It has, therefore, become relevant to study the dynamics of their integration with the available technologies. Of all renewable resources, Photovoltaic generation is the most prevalent resource in India. Keeping this in mind, a multistage cascaded converter system is developed in this paper. The proposed technique comprises of a PV (Photo voltaic) fed MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) controlled boost converter in cascade with a sliding mode controlled inverter. The paper aims at extracting maximum power from a PV source and converting it to a good quality ac power. The effect of variable output of PV generation due to varying solar irradiation has also been taken into consideration to establish the effectiveness of MPPT controlled boost converter.

This technique is based on mapping methods where initially space vector is expressed as sum of a contender vector and an error vector. The contender vector is the one which is nearest to the reference space vector. An error vector is arrived by calculating vector difference of a contender vector from reference vector. The error vector is translated to origin of space vector diagram by using translation methods. For an n-level inverter, there will be (n-1) steps in space vector diagram. Since the amplitude of the error vector will be less than one step of the space vector diagram, two level space vector technique can be applied to it. The switching states thus obtained can be added to contender vector to get a vector which is very close to the reference vector and follows it in time.

The probability of its occurrence is usually dominated by the photovoltaic penetration however, as a direct consequence of this, load-inverter dynamic interactions alongside grid-side disturbances can also lead to anomalous instances that can become responsible for accidental island creation and one such anomaly has been described in this work. Given such dynamic behaviours occurring on photovoltaic inverter-integrated distribution feeders, threshold based classical islanding detection can not suffice and hence machine learning based techniques have began to be researched and adopted. However the orientation can be directed towards predictive approaches leveraging knowledge extraction from huge event data available in smart grids.

VANET still has immense potential unknown areas and challenges makes it important research topic. One of the key challenges is finding a short and stable route in a short period under uncertain conditions; this is due to the high mobility of vehicle and rapid topology change. As an answer to this challenge, we propose Fuzzy Bacterial Foraging Optimization Zone Based Routing (FBFOZBR) protocol. This protocol uses three techniques. To increase stability, we used Zone Based Routing (ZBR). To find the short route in short period, we used Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO). To handle uncertain conditions of VANET, we used fuzzy logic. Simulation carried on FBFOZBR protocol and route performance results compared with state-of-Art routing protocol PFQAODV. In the first case, we fixed the node velocity and route performance studied at the different transmission rate. In the second case, we fixed the transmission rate and route performance studied at different node velocity. Simulation showed that under uncertain conditions, the discovered route by FBFOZBR is short and stable, compared to route discovered by PFQAODV.

Conventional WPS used three-phase full-bridge converter for the AC/DC conversion and need separate DC–DC boost converter to increase the DC voltage. Compared to the conventional method, the proposed WPS uses three-phase/three-switch Vienna rectifier for AC/DC conversion and boosts the DC voltage. The boosted DC voltage is again boosted by ZSI to reduce the voltage sag and increase the quality of power of the off-grid system. The ZSI uses the shoot-through states to improve the DC link voltage and decrease the electromagnetic interference noise. The combination of Vienna rectifier and ZSI provides best quality performance which improves the efficiency and reduces cost and total harmonic distortion.

Here, at first, the relevant features are selected from the dataset using locality preserving projection (LPP) algorithm which helps the diagnosis system to develop a classification model using the fuzzy logic system. After that, the rules for the fuzzy system are created from the sample data. Among the entire rules, the important and relevant group of rules are selected using OFBAT algorithm. Here, the opposition based learning (OBL) is hybrid to the firefly with BAT algorithm to improve the performance of the FAT algorithm while optimizing the rules of the fuzzy logic system. Next, the fuzzy system is designed with the help of designed fuzzy rules and membership functions so that classification can be carried out within the fuzzy system designed.

It is however notable that, that none of the CSFs listing propagated by the researchers find a straightforward application in the selection procedure. The paper bridges the gap between the two thrust areas by proposing a framework for applying the prioritized CSFs listed for direct utilization in the selection process.

Clusters are evaluated in terms of quality and accuracy. Measuring quality is a unsupervised approach that completely depends on edges, whereas measuring accuracy is a supervised approach that measures similarity between the real clustering and the predicted clustering. Accuracy cannot be measured for most of the real-world networks since real clustering is unavailable. Thus, it will be advantageous from the viewpoint of expert systems to develop a quality metric that can assure certain level of accuracy along with the quality of clustering. In this paper we have proposed a set of three quality metrics for graph clustering that have the ability to ensure accuracy along with the quality. The effectiveness of the metrics has been evaluated on benchmark graphs as well as on real-world networks and compared with existing metrics. Results indicate competency of the suggested metrics while dealing with accuracy, which will definitely improve the decision-making in expert and intelligent systems. We have also shown that our metrics satisfy all of the six quality-related properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Community detection; Graph clustering; Quality and accuracy measures; Social network analysis","Decision making; Expert systems; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Accuracy measures; Community detection; Graph clustering; Measuring accuracy; Quality metrices; Quality of clustering; Real-world networks; Unsupervised approaches; Quality control","Biswas, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India; email: abanumail@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997112311

The blurring in case of an up-sampled image is caused by the degradation of HF and VHF image details that correspond to fine details and edge regions during the up-sampling process. The degradation of HF and VHF image details is more significant than that of the flat and slowly varying regions. In order to resolve this problem effectively, a fuzzy composite scheme is developed which is based on the inverse modeling approach of HF degradation. During the pre-processing operation, the VHF components of an image are boosted up using recursive Laplacian of Laplacian (LOL) operator prior to image up-scaling. Subsequent to the image up-scaling, a fuzzy local adaptive Laplacian post-processing scheme is used which enhances the HF image details more than the low frequency image details based on local statistics in the up-scaled image. The HF restoration performance of the fuzzy based composite scheme is enhanced by improving its nonlinearity through the variations of different parameters of the fuzzy inference system (FIS) such as slope, width and the number of input-, and output membership functions. The effective fusion of pre-processing and post-processing operations makes the proposed scheme much effective to tackle the non-uniform blurring than the standalone pre-processing and post-processing techniques. Experimental results reveal that the proposed composite scheme gives much less blurring in comparison to the standalone schemes and performs better than most of the widely used interpolation schemes in terms of objective and subjective measures. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","De-blurring; Fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy logic; Interpolation; Laplacian; Local variance; Up-scaling","Computer circuits; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Laplace transforms; Membership functions; Restoration; Signal sampling; Deblurring; Fuzzy inference systems; Laplacians; Local variance; Upscaling; Image processing","Acharya, A.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology RourkelaIndia; email: aditya.acharya2011@gmail.com",,"Academic Press Inc.",10473203,,JVCRE,,"English","J Visual Commun Image Represent",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012075659

The field is brisk and it trances as there always remain research issues which are yet to explore. The problem of portfolio optimization comprises of finding an optimal distribution of funds among various available securities so as to maximize the return and minimize the risk. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one of the effectual and widely used optimization technique based on swarm intelligence. Mixing co-variance principles with ABC algorithm assists in quick convergence with more precision. This paper presents a novel co-variance guided Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for portfolio optimization. As portfolio optimization consists of simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives, this algorithm is named as Multi-objective Co-variance based ABC (M-CABC). The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark problems of portfolio optimization from the OR-library.

The manual assessment of pathology slides is time-consuming and complicated regarding various types of cell identification. This paper proposes an ensemble rule-based decision-making approach for morphological classification of erythrocytes. Firstly, the digital microscopic blood smear images are pre-processed for removal of spurious regions followed by colour normalisation and thresholding. The erythrocytes are segmented from background image using the watershed algorithm. The shape features are then extracted from the segmented image to detect shape abnormality present in microscopic blood smear images. The decision about the abnormality is taken using proposed multiple rule-based expert systems. The deciding factor is majority ensemble voting for abnormally shaped erythrocytes. Here, shape-based features are considered for nine different types of abnormal erythrocytes including normal erythrocytes. Further, the adaptive boosting algorithm is used to generate multiple decision tree models where each model tree generates an individual rule set. The supervised classification method is followed to generate rules using a C4.5 decision tree. The proposed ensemble approach is precise in detecting eight types of abnormal erythrocytes with an overall accuracy of 97.81% and weighted sensitivity of 97.33%, weighted specificity of 99.7%, and weighted precision of 98%. This approach shows the robustness of proposed strategy for erythrocytes classification into abnormal and normal class.

The continuous pressure asserted by these applications is so large that even versatile WiMAX networks are facing stiff challenges in fair distribution of resources to these real- and non-real-time applications. Maintenance of fairness and flagrant quality of service levels among various applications is only possible with adaptive and intelligent scheduling mechanism. Design of such system is only possible if artificial intelligence is embedded in base station scheduler. This paper proposes mechanism for allocation of resources in WiMAX networks utilizing fuzzy logic principles. The proposed mechanism guarantees that latency and throughput requirements of real- and non-real-time traffic classes are met. Variations in incoming traffic have been exploited and used in decision making for offering bandwidth to maintain effective performance levels for all traffic classes. The proposed scheduler considers requests from subscribers and exploits powers of fuzzy logic to extract new weights for queues serving various traffic classes in a WiMAX network on the basis of most recent values of latency, throughput and share of traffic. The scheduling framework has been rigorously tested by performing versatile experiments for ensuring quality of service levels under hard hitting conditions.

This can be achieved by vertical scaling or horizontal scaling of attached resources. Live virtual machine migration of virtual machines across physical machines is a vertical scaling technique which facilitates resource hotspot mitigation, server consolidation, load balancing and system level maintenance. As live migration is triggered during heavy workload (hotspot) and its procedure takes significant amount of resources to iteratively copy memory pages from source to destination, it affects the performance of other running VMs hosted on the source as well as destination physical machine (PM). Hence to avoid such performance interference effects it is necessary to trigger the migration procedure at such a point where sufficient amount of resources will be available to all the running VMs and to the migrating procedure. It is also important to select such a VM which will produce less performance interference at the source and destination. This paper presents an intelligent decision maker to trigger the migration in such a way that it avoids the said performance interference effects. It predicts the future workload for early detection of overloads and accordingly triggers the migration procedure.

Numerous algorithms have been dedicated in the literature and tremendous progresses have been made to find frequent patterns. Most of the methods introduced in the literature find all frequent patters for all attributes in the dataset. We introduced TR-FCTM (Transaction Reduction-Frequent Count Table method) for the same.

This paper proposes a novel approach to calculate CR in a target geographic area for the smart vehicles of VANET Infrastructure using fuzzy based controllers. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to reduce the computational complexity owing to the irregularity of traffic and frequent updation of CR value in VANET.

The goal of the presented controllers is to keep the turbine rotor speed within predefined limits during startup as well as during operating condition. For speed loop output rotor speed is controlled variable and inlet fuel flow rate is manipulating variable. The fuzzy controller and fuzzy-PI controller are designed using Takagi-Sugeno method and Mamdani method, respectively. In applying the fuzzy-PI control to a gas-turbine plant, the tuning parameters (KP and KI) are modified online by a fuzzy logic approach. Error and rate of change of error are inputs and change in fuel flow is output for both the controllers. Also, the constraints on the inlet fuel flow and output rotor speed are taken into account. The existing linear model of GT available in the literature is considered to design the speed controllers. The performance of Fuzzy and Fuzzy-PI controller is tested in the MATLAB Simulink environment. During simulations, the demand power is taken as disturbance input. The performance of the proposed controllers is compared with each other as well as with H∞ robust and MPC controllers for the same operating conditions. From the obtained results, it is observed that fuzzy controller reduces the overshoot and settling time as compared with MPC and H∞ controller. Fuzzy-PI controller response is better than MPC and fuel constraint is maintained in a smoother way. Fuzzy and Fuzzy-PI controllers can be considered as the options for the speed control of GT. © 2016 IEEE.","Fuzzy and Fuzzy-PI controllers; Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno methods; Power plant control","Automation; Fuels; Fuzzy logic; Gas turbines; MATLAB; Process control; Rotors; Speed; Speed control; Turbine components; Water craft; Controlled variables; Design and simulation; Fuzzy logic approach; Fuzzy-PI controllers; Gas turbine plants; Operating condition; Power plant control; Takagi-sugeno; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509020805,,,"English","Int.

Voltage sag results in decrease in competence of the systems which affect the manufacturers in terms of losses related to money and reliability. The transformer-coupled arrangement associated voltage-source inverter, called voltage sag compensator is among the most savvy arrangement against voltage sags. Transformers are mostly installed in front of critical loads for electrical separation purposes. When voltage dip occurs, the transformers are presented to the improper voltages and a dc offset occurs in its flux linkage. The flux linkage will be reach to the level of magnetic saturation at the time of compensator restores the load voltage and this cause's serious inrush current. The compensator may be interrupted because of its own over current protection, hence, the compensation gets failed, and the critical loads are interrupted by the voltage sag. This paper brings together a method for inrush current relief for voltage dip compensator with fuzzy logic controller.

Aggregate function computation and iceberg queries are important and common in many applications of data mining and data warehousing because people are usually interested in looking for unusual patterns by computing aggregate functions across many attributes. In spite of complexity of these queries decision makers want their request to be processed quickly. But these queries often require very long response time. So it is very important to process efficiently these expensive queries with aggregate functions in data warehousing environment. Presently available Iceberg query (IBQ) processing techniques faces the problem of empty Bitwise AND operation, and require more I/O access to execute query. None of the research provides the model for all aggregate functions. Proposed research applies look ahead matching strategy on Bitmap Index (BI) of query attributes. Before performing actual operation the analysis of logical operation is done if it satisfy threshold condition then only complete operation will be perform. In this way look ahead matching(LAM) strategy reduces the I/O access cost and solve the problem of empty bitwise AND operation. This research also proposes framework for other aggregate functions like MIN, MAX, SUM and COUNT. © 2016 IEEE.","Aggregate functions: MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT; Bitmap Index(BI); Bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR; Data warehouse(DW); Iceberg query (IBQ); Look Ahead Matching(LAM)","Aggregates; Automation; Data mining; Decision making; Process control; Sea ice; Aggregate function; Bitmap indexes; Bitwise operations; Iceberg query; Look Ahead Matching(LAM); Data warehouses",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509020805,,,"English","Int.

The movement of centroid as action advances yields a motion trajectory. The sequence of quantized orientations of trajectory segments are used as temporal features for action classification that uses probabilistic state models and maximum likelihood decision making strategy. The benchmark action datasets such as KTH dataset, Weizmann dataset and UIUC complex activity dataset are used to train and test state models of each action class.

The traffic across junctions is controlled by signaling patterns, where the signal duration is invariably static in nature. The traffic density across either sides of the road does not affect the duration of signal. For reducing the time taken in waiting across traffic junction, the proposed work aims at simulating a dynamic traffic signal using fuzzy logic which would change the timing of the green signal with respect to the intensity of traffic and feed this to an arduino microcontroller based fuzzy inference system which decides the duration of the green signal. The intensity of traffic is computed using two methods, feature detection and image subtraction methods.

The H.E. system plays a dynamic role in process industry. The performance of heat exchanger is largely depending upon the outlet fluid temperature. The selected heat exchanger system is intended to control the temperature of outlet fluid to a desired set point despite of different disturbances like fluid flow variations and fluctuations in input fluid temperature. The input fluid and inlet steam are the input parameters and outlet temperature of the fluid is the output parameter. Outlet fluid temperature is the controlled by manipulating the inlet steam flow. Whereas the deviation produced in input fluid flow is considered as one of the effective and dominant disturbance. Conventional PID controller is commonly used to control the output temperature. It has its own drawbacks and cannot handle the disturbance properly overall performance of PID is not satisfactory. This report is an attempt to design advanced controller like FLC and IMC for heat exchanger system. To design this controller, the mathematical modeling of H.E. is studied theoretically. Its component wise model is developed in MATLAB Simulink for this developed model, FLC has designed with different membership functions and Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno (TS) method, and its performance is compared with PID. Further for the same model IMC controller is designed. The performance of PID, FLC and IMC is compared in MATLAB Simulink environment. The performance of IMC controller is superior to PID and FLC.

As now the entire world is moving to achieve goal of becoming SMART PLANET, the technologies like IoT-Internet of Things getting popular and unavoidable in current scenario. As usage of IoT leads to huge collection of data, it certainly requires cloud platform to store the data and perform data analytics and decision making. Recent projects like SMART CITY which involves smart traffic management system, smart waste management system, smart water system etc. would involve various cloud providers offering services & resources and various cloud users using their services. So problem of resource utilization and profit maximization becomes very critical in this scenario. This paper focuses on survey of various auction mechanisms proposed for cloud market to solve the problem of decision making, resource utilization and cost efficiency. It also reviews various decision making models based on MCDM - Multi Criteria Decision Making approach. Very few attempts been made till date to support cloud users decision making process by considering various parameters/requirements. In this paper we are proposing decision making by using models like AHP(Analytical Hierarchy Process) combined with Double Sided Auction to select best cloud provider in an open cloud market with heterogeneous cloud user requirements and healthy competition amongst the cloud providers. In an open cloud market where multiple cloud providers are offering various services at varied cost, it's a very difficult decision for a user to select a best cloud service provider with best cost efficiency matching with various other parameters (like reliability, speed, user experience etc..) The providers also need to achieve best resource efficiency so that sharing/allocation of resources to various users are optimized. As there is no standard process to help user to make a decision, this paper focuses on combining Auction and AHP models together to help cloud users and providers to achieve win-win situation by achieving best resource, time, cost efficiency with heterogeneous environments and demands. © 2016 IEEE.","AHP; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Auction; Cloud Provider; Cloud services; Cloud User; Decision model; Provider selection","Automation; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Distributed database systems; Dynamics; Efficiency; Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Process control; Smart city; Surveys; Waste management; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Auction; Cloud providers; Cloud services; Decision modeling; Provider selection; Decision making",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509020805,,,"English","Int.

It is often referred as 'Predictive Maintenance'. Structural destructions occur in a beam which is used in bridge or in a rotating machine shaft. To prevent these conditions there should be structural health monitoring. Generally in detection techniques, NDT i.e. non-destructive testing is generally exploited due to inexpensive cost and its operation. Due to crack, stiffness (hardness) of the structure decreases and damping of the structure increases i.e. oscillation increases. A cantilever beam having single crack with crack depth utilized for experimentation. For this determination, the vibrations due to impact hammer were analysed. With the help of FFT using MATLAB, first three natural frequencies were taken to investigate crack depth size and crack location of the beam. Fuzzy logic is easily manipulated and it will generate a better result than predictable control technique. Both modes of FIS i.e. fuzzy inference system, Mamdani FIS and Takagi-Sugeno FIS are related for the calculation of crack depths and crack locations. Mamdani FIS offers realistic outcome than Takagi-Sugeno FIS and it is well suited to human input.

However PIDs are unable to control combustion control of solid fuel boiler with continuously varying demand. This results in improper combustion of fuel and air which in turn affecting performance of boiler. Therefore efficiency of boiler get reduced.

The primary task of WSN is to gather field data and route it to the BS for analysis. They are generally deployed in harsh localities where battery replacement is not possible advocating the need for energy efficient data gathering to elongate network lifetime. In cluster based hierarchical routing protocols (HRP's) the energy intensive task of being a cluster head are performed by a subset of deployed nodes while others are engaged in local communication. The roles of the nodes are interchanged in different rounds for load balancing.

A new method is proposed for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) through a single phase inverter with phase displacement control. The inverter control variable is redefined such that it can be used for MPPT. Due to this control technique one converter stage for power tracking is eliminated, leading to a reduced component count for the overall system. The high frequency transformer's model parameters are designed for an operating frequency of 20 kHz for simulation studies. The grid side converter is controlled for synchronization and power flow using a Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) current controller. The overall system is tested in simulation for a panel rating of 1.15 kWp under various insolation conditions and power balance is verified and presented.

The extracted solar energy can be used to drive motors for water pumping application. Motors used for this application are DC motors, induction motors or BLDC motors of which BLDC motors are more advantageous. BLDC motor is fed from a voltage source inverter which has a dc link capacitor at the front end. The life time of dc link capacitor is affected by its operating temperature. Also it adds to the cost of BLDC motor drive. The elimination of dc link capacitor reduces the cost and bulkiness of motor but it results torque ripple to arise at the output of motor. Thus to minimize torque ripple, a new method is proposed where the dc link capacitor is replaced by a ceramic capacitor and a switch. It reduces the torque ripple which arises due to the elimination of electrolytic capacitor and the compensation capacitor is only around 3% of original dc link capacitor. © 2016 IEEE.","BLDC motors; Solar PV; Torque ripple compensation; zeta converter","AC motors; Capacitors; Costs; DC motors; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Electric motors; Electrolytic capacitors; Induction motors; Solar energy; Torque; BLDC motors; Compensation capacitors; Operating temperature; Renewable resource; Solar PVs; Torque ripples; Voltage source inverter; Zeta converter; Brushless DC motors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

In Indian culture, women have always taken the back seat in family decision making. Their life revolves around the family and fulfilling its needs. Today, the condition of women has improved as compared to yester-years but, due to lack of awareness, they still use very limited resources to empower themselves. The sample for this study has been taken from the economic capital of India, Mumbai, where Information & Communication Technology (ICT) and digitization are easily accessible. Despite the easy accessibility of ICT and digitization, this paper suggests that women in this city appear to have a limited purpose in using the internet or ICT. ICT and digitization are largely used for online social interaction and entertainment. This study finds that women are dependent on their family before and after marriage, for financial decision making. Online education does not depend on age and employment status, but on educational qualification and marital status. Thus, the study suggests that social and economic inequality exists and that they hinder capacity-building among women. With the help of this study, one gains an understanding of the purposes for which women use available digital facilities. The findings suggest that governments need to design and implement more interactive awareness programmes and policies for women to empower them through the effective and efficient use of the digital platform. © 2017 ACM.","Digitalization; Information & communication technology; Social & financial inequality and awareness; Women empowerment","Decision making; Distance education; Government data processing; Awareness programmes; Communication technologies; Design and implements; Digitalization; Economic inequality; Financial decisions; Social interactions; Women empowerment; Economic analysis",,"De' R.Janowski T.Baguma R.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348256,,,"English","ACM Int.

The proposed approach employs a new methodology for segmenting the blood vessels from the retinal images more effectively. The overall process is carried out in five steps. The first step is to pre-process the image in order to remove the presence of noise in it and to convert the color image to grey scale image. Second step is the border detection process where the of the blood vessels is are moved by a border detection algorithm. Third step is the texture features are extracted from the detected border and then these features are given as input towards the Improved Fuzzy C Means clustering (IFCM) method in order to produce the membership function. Fourth step is the defuzzification process in which the outputs of the inference obtained for each pixel is combined to a final segmented output which provides a segmented foreground against the background. Final step is the Post-processing process where the unwanted pixels are filled or removed. Our proposed algorithm is tested over 180 images in order to analyse its efficiency.

The analysis is done by extracting drain current versus gate voltage characteristics, transconductance (gm), transconductance generation efficiency (gm/Ids), gate-to-gate capacitance (Cgg), ratio of gate-to-source capacitance (Cgs) to gate-to-drain capacitance (Cgd). Sensitivity analysis show that, JL transistors prove to be less sensitive to channel (gate) length variation as short-channel effect is amply controlled. It is also seen that ON-state current remains almost constant with increase in temperature. At a particular drain current (Ids) JL transistors achieve higher values of unity-gain cut-off frequency (fT) and gain bandwidth (GBW) product for ultra low power operation. Furthermore, mixed-mode circuit simulations have been performed by implementing Inverter circuit and a Common Source (CS) amplifier circuit using DG JL transistor. The inverter shows better noise margin for the given supply voltage. The CS amplifier gain increases with increase in RL. Maximum gain of 18 dB is obtained for RL= 15 KΩ with a 3-dB cut-off frequency of 0.955 THz. The results of these simulations give insights into the circuit level behaviour of JL transistor which can be used as a future device owing to its characteristics. © 2016 IEEE.","cut-off frequency; Double-gate (DG); inverter; junctionless (JL); mixed-mode circuit simulation","Amplifiers (electronic); Capacitance; Drain current; Electric inverters; Electric network analysis; Field effect transistors; Mixed signal integrated circuits; MOS devices; Sensitivity analysis; Threshold voltage; Timing circuits; Transconductance; Transistors; Double gate; Gate to source capacitances; Gate-to-drain capacitance; inverter; junctionless (JL); Junctionless transistor; Junctionless transistors; Mixed-mode circuits; Circuit simulation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509051632,,,"English","IEEE Stud.

Here, the method is developed to identify uncertain structural mass, stiffness and damping matrices from the dynamic responses of the structure without any optimization processes that are generally used to solve inverse vibration problems. Uncertainty has been taken in term of fuzzy numbers. The governing equations of motion are first solved by the classical method to get responses of the consecutive stories. Further the governing equations of motion are modified based on relative responses of consecutive stories in such a way that the new set of equations can be implemented in a cluster of FNNs. As such the model starts solving the nth floor by FNN modelling to estimate the structural parameters. Subsequently, series of FNN models are used to estimate the parameters for (n − 1)th storey to the first storey. One may note that single layer FNNs have been used for training for each cluster of the FNN such that the converged weights give the uncertain structural parameters. The initial weights in the FNN architecture are taken as the design parameters in uncertain (fuzzy) form. In order to validate the present model, various example problems of different multi-storey shear structures have been considered. Related results are incorporated in term of tables and graphs. Comparisons between theoretical and identified results are carried out and are found to be in good agreement. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","damping; fuzzy neural network; mass; shear buildings; stiffness; System identification","Damping; Equations of motion; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy sets; Identification (control systems); Inverse problems; Parameter estimation; Stiffness; Structural optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Design parameters; Governing equations of motion; Inverse vibration problem; mass; Shear buildings; Stiffness and damping; Structural parameter; Uncertain structural parameters; Fuzzy logic","Chakraverty, S.; Department of Mathematics, National Institute of Technology RourkelaIndia; email: chakravertys@nitrkl.ac.in",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17415977,,,,"English","Inverse Probl.

To overcome the shortcoming of classical set theory, Zadeh (Inf Control 8(3):338–356, 26) introduced the concept of fuzzy sets that generalizes the concept of classical sets. Fuzzy set theory allows modelling and handling of imprecise information in an effective way. As a special class of fuzzy sets, fuzzy numbers (FN) which are very much important in decision making was introduced by Dubois and Prade (Int J Syst Sci 9:631–626, 12). The available methods for solving multi-criteria decision making problems (MCDM) are problem dependent in nature due to the partial ordering on the class of FN. Total ordering on the class of FN by countable number of real-valued parameters was achieved by Wang and Wang (Fuzzy Sets Syst 243:131–141, 21). A complete ranking on the class of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) using finite number of score functions is achieved in this paper. In this paper, a new ranking procedure (complete) on the class of TrFNs using the concepts of mid-point, radius, left and right fuzziness of TrFN is proposed and further we introduce a method for solving fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (Fuzzy MCDM) problem.

The demand at the retailer's end depends on the retail price and quality of the product. Each manufacturer customizes his/her product to differentiate it from the other manufacturers’ products. Manufacturers compete with each other over price and quality in the presence of brand differentiation. In this set up, we consider two scenarios: (i) when customers do not have the facility of return and refund, and (ii) when customers do have the facility of return and get full refund. We analyze the pricing and quality management strategies of the manufacturers and the retailer in each scenario for centralized and decentralized systems. Through our study we find that brand differentiation increases retail price and quality of the product. We also see that, to make full refund policy more profitable than no return, reservation price has to be set higher. Using revenue sharing mechanism, we coordinate the decentralized system and make it a win-win situation for each party involved.

These problems may be interpreted in terms of fuzzy numbers. Hence, a proper method of comparing and ranking these fuzzy numbers is very essential. In recent years, numerous way of ranking fuzzy numbers have been proposed. Most of the existing approaches have shortcomings and limitations under certain circumstances. In particular symmetric fuzzy numbers having same core and different supports, fuzzy numbers having same support and different cores, crisp valued fuzzy numbers, crisp valued fuzzy numbers having same support and different heights and fuzzy numbers having compensation of areas are not properly ranked in most of the studies. Hence, a new method of ranking fuzzy number using the value and the ambiguity, which are ill-defined magnitude and amount of vagueness present in the ill-defined magnitude respectively, at different decision level has been proposed. The proposed method has been discussed on the concept of parametric form of fuzzy number with the defuzzifiers are at different heights and the concept of decision levels. This concept of parametric form of fuzzy number with the defuzzifiers are at different heights has been discussed for the first time. The proposed method has been compared with other existing methods through numerical examples and found to outperform in all situations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can clearly overcome the addressed limitations and shortcomings.

The most commonly used method for analysing GMCDM problem is technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The conventional TOPSIS method uses a measure similar to energy for the ranking of alternatives. We demonstrate that the ranking of the alternatives is more meaningful if we use exergy in place of energy. The use of exergy is superior due to the inclusion of a factor accounting for the quality of the ratings by the expert group. The unevenness in the ratings by the experts is measured by entropy. The procedure for the calculation of the thermodynamical indicators is explained in both crisp and fuzzy environments. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying to human resource selection problem. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Exergy; Fuzzy; GMCDM; Thermodynamics; TOPSIS","Entropy; Exergy; Thermodynamics; Fuzzy; Fuzzy environments; GMCDM; Group multi-criteria decision makings; ITS applications; Ranking of alternatives; Resource selection; TOPSIS; Decision making","Verma, M.; CSIR-Structural Engineering Research CentreIndia; email: mohitverma@serc.res.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

However, the above approaches occasionally fail to generate inferences, although semantically plausible fuzzy inferences follow as a natural consequence of the given set of rules and fuzzy facts/observations. This paper serves to fill this void. It extends propositional syntax and semantics in the context of fuzzy reasoning to transform/re-structure individual rules to a suitable form (by negating and transposing propositions from antecedent to consequent and vice-versa), so as to get the propositions present in the antecedent (consequent) instantiated (refuted) by positive (negative) facts to enable the rules for forward (backward) firing. Next fuzzy compositional rule of inference is used to perform forward/backward reasoning. Consequently, when the rules are embedded in a fuzzy Petri net like structure, the rules apparently fire randomly in forward or backward direction without maintaining any topological order in transition-firing. Such random firing of rules in distributed parts of the network is referred to as ad hoc reasoning. Here, we transform such randomly ordered forward/backward firing sequence of transitions in the network into a fixed topological order of transition-firing in forward direction only by replacing backward firing transitions into equivalent forward firing transitions. The proposed method of automated reasoning has successfully been applied in diagnostic application of an electronic rectifier circuit, and the results are appealing. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Ad hoc reasoning; Fuzzy logic network; Propositional syntax and semantics; Rule transformation/re-structuring","Computer circuits; Electric rectifiers; Fuzzy logic; Petri nets; Semantic Web; Semantics; Syntactics; Topology; Ad hoc reasoning; Automated reasoning; Compositional rule of inferences; Diagnostic applications; Fuzzy logic networks; Natural consequences; Rule transformation/re-structuring; Traditional approaches; Fuzzy inference","Janarthanan, R.; Artificial Intelligence Lab, ETCE Dept., Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: srmjana_73@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",0888613X,,IJARE,,"English","Int J Approximate Reasoning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007622289

Group members from wider spectrum of the environment naturally command variation in knowledge level to their respective domain. The degree of heterogeneity of the decision makers in a group plays a crucial role in realistic assessment of both alternatives and selection criteria. This paper proposes a new Multi criteria GDM approach in adroit exploitation of the group heterogeneity during evaluation process and restrict the biasness of information while decision making. The importance of the heterogeneous degree of expertise is established through pair wise preference comparison matrix. To overcome the biasness, the consistency check mechanism of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is employed. A real case example on warehouse location selection in a supply chain is illustrated to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In order to ensure the applicability, compatibility and validity of the proposed approach, comparative study is carried out with the proven and established MCDM methodologies SAW, MOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, ELECTRE II, COPRAS and PROMETHEE.

To support anytime-anywhere seamless broadband services to all mobile subscribers, more number of macro base stations (BSs) have to be deployed. The macro BSs are power inefficient and also responsible for large carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The increase in the number of macro BSs will also increase the system cost and interference. The concept of multi-hop relay network has been widely discussed in long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) standard, where the low power relay stations (RSs) are also deployed along with the macro BS to address the coverage and capacity issues. However, improper BS and RS deployment introduces power inefficiency, transmission delay, huge deployment cost and reduced throughput. Many of the conventional deployment schemes require iterative and complex computation. These deployment schemes are not eco-friendly and do not sustain for all channel conditions. In this work, we have proposed an eco-friendly, power-aware, fuzzy based BS and RS deployment algorithm to maximize the coverage and capacity of the system. Unlike the conventional methods, a new parameter called power consumption effectiveness ratio, which accounts for the greenness of the network is proposed and included in the fuzzy based decision making process along with the coverage ratio and traffic ratio. The simulation results prove that the proposed scheme is superior over the conventional uniform clustering and fuzzy based schemes. Further the proposed scheme is more suitable candidate for power-aware green radio communication. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","BS deployment; Coverage ratio (CR); Fuzzy logic; Multi-hop relay (MHR) network; Power consumption effectiveness ratio (PCER); RS deployment; Traffic ratio (TR)","Base stations; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Computation theory; Decision making; Electric power utilization; Environmental protection; Fuzzy logic; Iterative methods; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Low power electronics; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Standards; Telecommunication repeaters; Complex computation; Conventional methods; Coverage ratio; Decision making process; Deployment algorithms; Multi-hop relay; Multi-hop relay networks; RS deployment; Wireless telecommunication systems","Arthi, M.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: arthimdas@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",22105379,,,,"English","Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007502869

An induction furnace (IF), which is an indispensable component of the steel industry, is one such typical example of a nonlinear load. It injects a considerable amount of harmonics into the supply network and consequently the performance of other loads in its vicinity gets affected. An 11-level cascaded multilevel inverter (CMLI)-based distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is implemented to mitigate the harmonic content of an IF in a steel plant. A Simulink model of an IF has been developed using experimental data obtained on-line from an industrial IF using a power quality analyzer. The solution methodology proposed using CMLI-based DSTATCOM reveals the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for voltage sag mitigation and total harmonic distortion improvement of both load current and voltage as per the IEEE standards. The results obtained are also compared with that reported in the literature recently. © 2017 IEEE.","Custom power; distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM); harmonics; induction furnace (IF); power quality","Electric furnaces; Electric inverters; Harmonic analysis; Induction heating; Land vehicle propulsion; Power quality; Steelmaking; Cascaded multi-level inverters; Custom power; Distribution static compensator; harmonics; Induction furnace; Power distribution network; Power quality analyzer; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Static synchronous compensators","Saggu, T.S.; PEC University of TechnologyIndia; email: saggutejinder@gmail.com",,"IEEE Canada",08408688,,CJEEE,,"English","Can J Electr Comput Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029600012

Energy Absorbing System (EAS) is one of the important subsystems of AABS. The energy absorber consists of two velocity sensitive turbine type conventional rotary hydraulic energy absorbers. There is no control in conventional EAS on energy absorption during operation of an aircraft emergency arrestment. Also, if there is any problem with conventional EAS during operation, complete system fails. For different types of aircrafts different EAS needed. To overcome these problems, we suggest to use the combination of existing conventional EAS and eddy current absorbing (ECA) system. This proposed (ECA) system with existing conventional system will help in the stopping of any Aircraft (like light weight, heavy weight, etc).

Manual approach often used for switching the lights and thereby leaving lights to remain ON even if not in use. Fluorescent light doesn't support dimming, so user needs to replace light source with different wattage to achieve different intensities. Also, they are energy inefficient. Electronic ballasts on the other hand supports dimming but are expensive. Thus, existing light system need to upgrade.

There is a big gap between generation and demand of Electric energy. Since the deposits of Non-renewable energy are limited, the only solution is to use Renewable energy. Solar energy which is present in abundance can play a vital role to overcome the energy deficiency. The potential of solar voltaic energy can also be exploited for averting environmental pollution and managing atmospheric emission. This research paper provides a proposal for design of an inverter using dual axis solar tracker installed on rooftop. The paper focuses on presenting the structure and application of a microcontroller based dual axis solar tracker which tracks the direction of the solar radiation thereby adjusting the movement of solar panel accordingly. This facilitates the sun to remain perpendicular to the PV panel throughout the day which makes the total energy received to be increased by 50-60%. The energy hence received gets stored in a chargeable battery. This battery has an inverter attached to it so that whenever there is a power-cut, the stored energy may be used to light up the appliances. The stated research aims at minimizing the dependence on power from national grid station to meet the daily energy requirements in both urban and rural areas of the country. © 2016 IEEE.","azimuth angle; light dependent resistor; reed switch; solar altitude angle; Solar energy; solar tracker; stepper motor","Developing countries; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Energy policy; Photovoltaic cells; Reed relays; Solar energy; Stepping motors; Azimuth angles; Light dependent resistor; Solar altitude angle; Solar tracker; Stepper motor; Electric power transmission networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026128,,,"English","Int.

Solar energy is one of the important renewable sources of energy since it is clean, pollution free and inexhaustible. Though the initial installation cost is high the maintenance cost is considerable less. The output Power of Photovoltaic array always changes with weather conditions i.e., solar irradiation and atmospheric temperature. The energy that is being absorbed by photovoltaic cells is not being completely utilized because of irradiance effects. Hence Maximum power point tracking techniques(MPPT) are employed in photovoltaic systems to utilize the energy that is absorbed. These techniques vary in many aspects as range of effectiveness, hardware, sensor required, and cost. This paper presents a comparison analysis of existing MPPT techniques and then an optimal controller is designed and implemented which has a better performance in achieving high efficiency. In designing the controller circuit the algorithm that has proved the best basing on simulation results has been adopted for designing the controller circuit. The entire simulation was carried out using Matlab simulink tool. The model includes accepting the input from the available source by considering a step variation in the input conditions, a physical to simulink converter circuit, a DC-DC converter circuit with designed parameters according to the load considered and a controller circuit.

The proposed telecom power supply uses a high gain DC-DC MPPT converter having high efficiency and very low current ripples through two interleaved inductors to power 380V DC bus to cater Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and retrofit Auxiliary/ Data Center loads. The topology provides isolation to avoid common mode problems/ leakage currents together with low stresses on the switches making it robust and highly efficient. A LLC resonant converter is also proposed to cater the BTS load at 48V from the DC bus to supply constant voltage at constant power with high hold up time amidst large voltage variations. The proposed control operates the two converters at different range of frequencies such that possibility of interference with each other is totally eliminated. For realizing storage-less operation the load controller is also employed which equalizes the power based on insolation changes and load perturbations.

Broadly simulation can be of two types, Off-line and Real-Time Simulation. Off-line simulation uses a digital computer and real time simulation uses a dedicated high speed digital processing hardware. Real time simulation allows analysis of a physical system in real-Time. Full Spectrum Simulator (FSS) provides both off-line and real-Time simulation capabilities at an affordable cost, easily configurable for custom applications. FSS is useful for real-Time simulation of large power systems and power electronic equipments. Applications of real-Time simulation includes training and demonstration of power electronic systems, closed loop testing of power subsystem protective relays, evaluation of control hardware and software and testing of high power systems like FACTS devices, Custom Power devices, AC/DC motor drives etc. This paper deals with simulation of a DC-DC fly back converter in real-Time using FSS Mini. For real-Time simulation using FSS, the main objective was to create an average model of the fly back converter in CCM mode of operation. Average model was derived from the circuit equations and designed the values of the parameters used in the averaged model.

As power and voltage rating increases; device constraint as well ashigh switching loss creates serious problems. Various pulse width modulated strategies like sinusoidal; 3rd harmonic injection and space vector PWM (SVPWM) employs high frequency switching to obtain quality output voltage with less ripple. Increasing number of voltage levels in a multi-level inverter requires an increase in number of active switches and passive elements. The problem of dead time requirement and shoot-through in PWM inverters distorts the output waveform and transfers less energy to load. A new type of three-phase VSI called three-phase Infinite Level Inverter (ILI) is proposed to mitigate all the above problems to a large extent. The device constraint and switching loss at high frequency is substantially reduced due to lower input DC supply. To get same output voltage; the proposed inverter requires only half of the DC link voltage compared to sine PWM inverter. Also; ILI takes only 0.576 times the input DC voltage compared to 3rd harmonic-injection or SVPWM. This shows that the proposed inverter has the maximum DC link utilization. The number of active switches and passive elements are same for any number of voltage levels. This topology is a multi-level inverter as there are many levels in the output voltage. Shoot-through problem is avoided and thus the proposed inverter doesn't need a dead time; leading to a better system reliability. Hysteresis current control is used for closed loop control. Results obtained from experimental setup and computer simulation using MATLAB/Simulink are presented to verify the above scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","High DC Link Utilization; Multi-level Inverter; Three-phase PWM Inverter","Electric current control; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Power control; Power electronics; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Closed-loop control; DC links; High-frequency switching; Hysteresis current control; Multilevel inverter; Pulse width modulated voltage source inverters; Pulse-width-modulated; PWM inverter; Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A solar cell being the smallest energy unit of any solar power system, an array of such solar cells constitutes a solar panel. The output of a solar panel follows a nonlinear current voltage characteristic which depends primarily on irradiance, temperature and load connected. A distinct point for fixed atmospheric conditions for which maximum power is extracted from the panel is the Maximum Power Point(MPP). A number of constraints are associated with installing, operating and thus studying the behaviour and designing a power system for solar panels. This paper thus discusses about the design of prototype indoor solar panel simulator along with the design of a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) System. Using this design efficiently, a large range of panels for various dynamic atmospheric conditions can be simulated. Various MPPT algorithms can be tested and analysed for their performance in actual solar power systems.

Formation of islanding phenomenon is one of the major issued problem confronted with this kind of power generation scheme, in which DG source may keep working in a stable or normal way even if main electric power system (EPS) has failed. There are various methodologies have been evolved and advanced to avert this situation. They are classified as detection through passive method, active and communication systems based method. Islanding occurrences is the most issued problem in a recent time power system working along with the DG. A variety of problems occur when a solar Photovoltaic is working as distributed generated (DG) source. Islanding refers to a condition when a DG source continues to supply power to a load even though there is no power from the main source during the disconnection from the main grid at the occurrence of fault or some other severe phenomenon, refers to a situation or condition called islanding. When workers who may not perceive that the load is still powered after the disconnection from the EPS or main source so this condition can be dangerous to the grid workers. When this condition occur the DG source should gets immediately disconnected from the local load in minimum time delay. Islanding causes unfavorable effects which are low power quality, personnel potential danger, grid-protection interference and equipment damage. Islanding can causes very dangerous or abnormal situation for both people and apparatus, So islanding should be quickly determine by inverters and protective relays. Islanding finding out through passive method examines system specification without inducing any interruption and disturbance into the grid (EPS). In this proposed paper the detection is based on distortion of output voltage, it measures Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) or frequency jump, Rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) at the Point of Common Coupling and detection by voltage unbalanced factor to reduces the non detection zone (NDZ). © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed Generation; Islanding Detection; Micro-grids; Passive Method; PV Array","Delay control systems; Distributed power generation; Electric equipment protection; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Intelligent control; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power electronics; Solar power generation; Specifications; Time delay; Electric power systems (EPS); Islanding detection; Micro grid; Passive methods; Point of common coupling; PV arrays; Rate of change of frequencies; Rate of change of voltages; Electric power system control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

To mitigate this difficulty and power fluctuations at the load end, a possible solution could be the integration of battery energy storage with PV system. The Storage system can potentially improve security, quality, reliability and availability of electricity supply from Solar PV power system. The Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) [1] is promising energy storage for reliability, scalability and deep discharge capacity. This paper presents an optimized power management scheme for solar PV power driven DC pump with energy storage for rural irrigation. The integrated PV system will supply power to the required demand of the 2 HP DC pump and excess power will charge the battery via a suitable DC-DC boost Converter [2]. During PV Power generation deficiency, the battery will be in discharging mode to supply the required power to drive the pump depending on its State of Charge (SOC) [3] and thus smoothens the transient power during that period. The PV output power is enhanced by implementing Perturb and observe (P&O) MPPT algorithm [4-5] under a set of practical insolation data. A 6kWh, 39 cells VRB storage [6] system has been modeled in MATLAB/ Simulink environment and the charge-discharge algorithm is decided based on real time VRFB State of Charge (SOC) prediction and Solar PV generation.

The proposed topology has been analyzed for both symmetric and asymmetric modes of operation. A comparative study of the proposed topology with some recent MLI topologies has been presented. The comparative study indicates that the proposed topology requires less number of dc sources; switches and driver circuits as compared to other topologies.

The synchronous buck based LED driver is used to control LED brightness and fulfills the constant current for LED driving.

With the advancement in power electronics, dynamic response is no more a problem with induction motor. This paper demonstrates three speed control methods for induction motor. One of the three methods discussed here is scalar control in which speed control is done by varying the voltage and frequency keeping their ratio constant, the second method is Indirect Field oriented control (IFOC) in which rotor flux orientation is used, and the last method is Direct Torque Control (DTC) in which speed control is done by computing torque and stator flux directly from motor parameters.

This power is fed to the AC load using a voltage source inverter (VSI) through the battery bank (BSS) at DC link. The control algorithm operates in standalone mode and grid connected mode.

For its implementation, a least complex grid synchronization approach was used for the generation of parallel and orthogonal components of the grid voltage in an efficient manner using various computing techniques to generate a synchronized current reference value in the current control loop. An improved H6 single-phase inverter topology ensures the elimination of the common-mode leakage current in the transformer-less photovoltaic grid-connected system. In addition this topology is also capable of withstanding the low input voltage similar to full-bridge inverter without causing any fault. The H6 inverter topology allows both unipolar Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SINUSOIDAL PWM) as well as the bipolar (i.e. double frequency) SINUSOIDAL PWM control techniques for three-level output. Two additional switches are decoupled on the dc side for higher efficiency and convenient thermal design.

Thus a standalone PV system is presented suitable 3-phase low voltage applications. The DC-DC converters are connected in forward power stage for boosting PV voltage and as bidirectional interface for battery backup. The system control is such that it avoids battery overcharging or deep discharging by maintaining the battery SOC levels. This is facilitated by the Desired Power Control (DPC) of system algorithm which tracks the PV power according to the load requirements. Major drawback of control of the standalone system is management of excess PV power which is solved by using DPC without the use of dump loads which are difficult to manage. The control of the DC-DC converters is done analytically for accurate tracking the changing references according to the prevailing conditions. The ac voltage regulation of the inverter is enhanced by using the abc-dq transformation and its control is also done analytically.

Apart from the conventional and non-conventional methods of generating power, researchers are finding other ways of utilizing the energy that is wasted in the environment in form of vibrations, pressure, heat, sound, etc. Thus, Energy harvesting from the environment comes out as a clean and sustainable way to power these devices. In this paper an attractive approach is proposed to harvest energy from human shoes particularly Soldier's shoe. A soldier carries numerous electronic gadgets for his mission which needs uninterrupted power supply. An alternative way is proposed here to power the Soldier's Electronic System or to recharge his batteries. This approach is implemented with the help of piezoelectric materials. The idea is to incorporate piezo polymers i.e. PVDF stacks beneath the heels of their shoes and generate electrical power merely by walking/running. This approach generates clean & green power which can even be stored for future use in absence of load. DC-DC converters were employed to maximize the electrical power from the material, to store it in a Super capacitor & to enhance the efficiency of the system. This power can be later utilized to power the soldier's electronics gadgets or and can also power a passive RF tag system for tracking soldier's in remote areas. © 2016 IEEE.","Buck-boost Converter; DSSH; Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Piezogenerator; PVDF","Crystallography; Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Energy harvesting; Intelligent control; Piezoelectricity; Power control; Power electronics; Sustainable development; Buck boost converter; DSSH; Low-powered devices; Non-conventional methods; Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Piezogenerator; PVDF; Uninterrupted power supply; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

With the objective of improvement in performance and efficiency of isolated SCPVM based PV water pumping system, a Multi-input single-output (MISO) DC-DC converter is used in this paper. The contribution of this paper is to provide an effective PV system without battery storage for water pumping applications so as to minimize the effects of partial shading and mismatch phenomena even though when PV modules are connected in series. Different irradiation patterns are observing the behavior during partial shading. The proposed system is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. Results show that use of MISO DC-DC converter instead of conventional DC-DC converter in SCPVM increases the PV power output and thus enhance the water pumping action. © 2016 IEEE.","BLDC; Multiple-Input Single-Output DC-DC Converter; Photovoltaic (PV); Water Pumping","Cost effectiveness; Electric inverters; Intelligent control; Photovoltaic cells; Potable water; Power control; Power converters; Power electronics; Pumping plants; Pumps; Water; BLDC; Cost-effective solutions; Multi input single outputs; Multiple input single outputs; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic systems; Pv water pumping systems; Water pumping; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Additionally, three-phase, four-wire distribution systems faces poor power quality problems such as unbalanced loading, excessive neutral current and voltage distortion due to current harmonics. In order to keep the voltage within a limit and mitigate such power quality problems, reactive power compensation devices such as distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) are used as custom power devices which help in increasing the operational efficiency and reliability of power distribution systems. In a D-STATCOM, generally, the DC link capacitor voltage is regulated using a proportional integral (PI) controller along with various control algorithms used for load compensation. However, during load changes, there is considerable variation in DC link capacitor voltage which might affect compensation. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based supervisory method is presented to improve transient performance of the DC link. A mamdani fuzzy logic based controller is designed in such a way that the gains generated by the fuzzy supervisor are added to the reference proportional and integral gains of the PI controller which helps to maintain the DC Link voltage. A MATLAB/Simulink model for the system with a resistive inductive (R-L) load is developed using SimPower Toolbox. It is observed that the fuzzy logic supervised D-STATCOM successfully compensates for the reactive power required by the load. A transient (load throw off condition) is created by removing one of the phases of the load for a short duration. The DC link capacitor voltage is observed and compared to a case when only a conventional PI controller is used with no fuzzy supervision. It is observed that the proposed controller has a better performance than the conventional one in terms of better voltage regulation and faster settling time. © 2016 IEEE.","D-STATCOM; DC Link; Fuzzy Logic; PCC; Voltage Regulation","Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric current regulators; Electric power utilization; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Quality control; Reactive power; Static synchronous compensators; Two term control systems; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Voltage regulators; DC links; Dc-link capacitor voltages; DSTATCOM; Four-wire distribution systems; Fuzzy logic based controller; Proportional integral controllers; Reactive power compensation; Reactive power compensation device; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The quality of output voltage waveform is an important consideration when directly feeding such drives and therefore its Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) becomes a significant parameter. In this article, the output voltage THD of the inverter has been minimized for both symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The proposed approach is an evolutionary and simple robust stochastic search algorithm which overcomes the limitations of Resultant Theory and Newton Raphson method. In this paper, simulation results for 11-level and 13-level CMLI have been presented.

Undoubtedly, the soft switching reduces the power loss in the Main switch while improving the overall EMI in the converters. This facilitates the increase of switching frequency of converters. This paper highlights a design methodology for the transformer in a fly back converter, which automatically accomplishes the complete soft switching of the main switch. No extra circuit or the control scheme is needed to attain Zero Current Turn On and total Zero Voltage Switching (both during turn ON and Turn OFF) of the Main MOSFET switch. Also, it eliminates the Dissipative snubber which is an essential component in fly back converter. However, this scheme is wholly applicable to fixed Input and constant load applications. Nevertheless, most of the Industry scenarios are similar at low power range of about 50 to 100 watts, because invariably the DC-DC converters are operated from a Power factor correction module (Whose output is fairly regulated to around 400V DC) and the output load is constant. The design concept is demonstrated on a 60 watt fly back converter operating from a 400V DC bus and operated at 100 KHz. © 2016 IEEE.","Complete Energy Transfer; Fly Back Converter; Soft Switching; Transformer Design","DC-DC converters; Design; Electric inverters; Energy transfer; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Switching; Zero current switching; Zero voltage switching; Control schemes; Design concept; Design Methodology; Dissipative snubbers; Flyback converters; MOSFET switches; Power factor corrections; Transformer design; Power converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Features of the proposed WECS include three concave rotating wind vanes situated at the external periphery of the turbine and a hybrid design of VAWT resulting in optimum tip speed ratio (TSR). Venturi effect is produced by dynamically altering the angles of the flaps by closed loop mechanism. The vanes shield the turbine from high velocity winds & augment its performance in low velocity winds. The proposed FIS approach is to approximate the power curve by using an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system based on Sugeno model that uses the wind speed and Guide Vane's angle as the inputs and the mechanical power as the output. A hardware prototype of the WECS is used for collecting training data for different guide vane's angle and wind speed conditions.

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is applied as a control methodology using a fixed band hysteresis controller. Mathematical modeling of the VSI circuit is done through state space analysis. This control method provides robust current voltage regulations under load and line parameter variations and achieve unity power factor. Both two level and three level switching algorithms are implemented with SMC. It has been found that the use of three level switching algorithms with SMC gives good grid current response with less total harmonic distortion (THD) in a VSI interfaced to the grid.

The effect of source voltage unbalance results in unbalanced load current with reduced modulation index. This paper proposes slope suppression techniques to compensate for the source unbalance and achieve balanced output current. It is operated at its maximum modulation index. In order to analyze these effects, two methods namely carrier slope suppression (CSS) and reference slope suppression (RSS) techniques have been identified. An even level multilevel inverter topology comprising of a base six switch inverter, cascaded with H bridge modules in each phase is considered for analysis. Conventional sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) is developed for a four level inverter and its inadequacy to produce a balanced output under unbalanced voltage condition is analyzed.

Generally, in conventional DSTATCOM operation, the dc-link voltage is maintained constant by PI controller (i.e, 2 times peak of PCC voltage). Because of fixed voltage, the switches of Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) are subjected to high voltage stresses during off-peak load conditions. It leads to increase in switching losses and deterioration of inverter reliability. During off-peak load, lesser value of dc-link voltage is sufficient to improve power quality. The proposed algorithm will give the reference dc-link voltage corresponding to load rating, and it is computed based on filter burden. The advantage of proposed algorithm is switching stresses reduced. The proposed algorithm is validated through detailed simulation studies. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive dc-link voltage; DSTATCOM; power quality; voltage source inverter","Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; HVDC power transmission; Static synchronous compensators; Voltage regulators; DC link voltage regulation; DC-link voltages; DSTATCOM; High-voltage stress; Power quality improvement; Simulation studies; Switching stress; Voltage source inverter; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015446059

Because of which the output voltage of cascaded H-bridge inverter becomes asymmetrical. The two or more modules of the H-bridges will have different switching stresses if the voltages across dc link capacitors are asymmetrical. To maintain the symmetrical voltage across capacitors of cascaded multilevel inverter, boost converters is operated according to proposed algorithm. The output of the boost converters with proposed algorithm keeps the voltage symmetrical both under uniform and non-uniform environmental conditions on each SPV array.

To validate the proposed algorithm we have conducted an experiment in an indoor laboratory environment. © 2016 IEEE.","detection of faulty nodes; detection of forest fire; Wireless sensor network","Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forestry; Fuzzy logic; Probability; Safety engineering; Wireless sensor networks; Ecological balance; Faulty node; Forest fire detection; Forest fire monitoring; Forest fires; Forest resources; Laboratory environment; Safety critical applications; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015411909

MANET in fact is selfsufficient group of cellular consumers which talk to each other with the help of cellular nodes, described by certain wireless links. In these applications, in order to offer quality services for MANETs, many routing protocols have been designed. In this paper, a novel method that detects and prevents the supportive black hole attack on MANETs is developed. The proposed method is based on adaptive fuzzy inference system for MANET in order to detect and prevent the cooperative black hole attack. The popular protocol utilized in MANET is on-demand distance vector (AODV) protocol, and is simulated using NS2. The simulated results of the proposed method are compared with that of an adaptive method [17], wherein source node checks all nodes activity by using DAT table that maintains from-node-to-next-node's information and declares black hole node by channel overhearing method.

Usually, images are accompanied by text caption along with associated documents describing the image. Textual query expansion as a form of enhancing image retrieval is a relatively less explored area. In this paper, we first study the effect of expanding textual query on both image and its associated text retrieval. Our study reveals that judicious expansion of textual query through keyphrase extraction can lead to better results, either in terms of text-retrieval or both image and text-retrieval. To establish this, we use two well-known keyphrase extraction techniques based on tf-idf and KEA. While query expansion results in increased retrieval efficiency, it is imperative that the expansion be semantically justified. So, we propose a graph-based keyphrase extraction model that captures the relatedness between words in terms of both mutual information and relevance feedback. Most of the existing works have stressed on bridging the semantic gap by using textual and visual features, either in combination or individually. The way these text and image features are combined determines the efficacy of any retrieval. For this purpose, we adopt Fisher-LDA to adjudge the appropriate weights for each modality. This provides us with an intelligent decision-making process favoring the feature set to be infused into the final query. Our proposed algorithm is shown to supersede the previously mentioned keyphrase extraction algorithms for query expansion significantly. A rigorous set of experiments performed on ImageCLEF-2011 Wikipedia Retrieval task dataset validates our claim that capturing the semantic relation between words through Mutual Information followed by expansion of a textual query using relevance feedback can simultaneously enhance both text and image retrieval. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Fisher-LDA; Keyphrase Extraction; Multimodal Retrieval; Mutual Information; Query Reformulation","Decision making; Expansion; Extraction; Graphic methods; Image retrieval; Query processing; Semantics; Fisher-LDA; Keyphrase extraction; Multi-modal; Mutual informations; Query reformulation; Information retrieval","Datta, D.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi - 221 005, India; email: ddatta.rs.cse13@iitbhu.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992121110

Many traditional systems used pulse width modulation (PWM) technique to control the DFIG block by a feedback from the load terminal. PWM schemes generate the control pulses for an inverter switches. An independent activation of the wind turbine generator does not offer optimum result. This paper presents the fuzzy-based PWM controlling of wind turbine system in DFIG to provide an optimum result. According to the torque level and the rotation speed of wind turbine, the speed of the generator is controlled to maintain voltage regulation at load side. The integration of ABC-direct quadrature transformation based on the fuzzy rule generates the necessary control signals for gates. To control the operation of multilevel converters, an enhanced phase differential space vector PWM modulation (EPD-SVPWM) is implemented in this paper. The transfer function for maintenance of the reduced level of ripples in inverter switching circuit included in the modification of SVPWM lead to high-speed switching of the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Consequently, it results in a low error rate and regulated power at load side. The experimental results exhibit better performance regarding dynamic voltage variation impact, and output voltage level at load side than the existing methods. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ABC-DQ transformation; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Fuzzy rule; Space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM); Wind turbine (WT) system","Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Energy conversion; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Modulation; Pulse width modulation; Turbogenerators; Vector spaces; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Wind power; Wind turbines; D-q transformation; Doubly fed induction generators; High-speed switching; Maximum energy captures; Space vector pulse width modulation; Transformation based; Wind energy conversion system; Wind turbine systems; Asynchronous generators","Bhanu, P.; Department of Instrumentation, Madras Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: eee.eie2012@gmail.com",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,,"English","Int.

However, newly developed soft computing based techniques can provide solution. In order to have advantages of conventional and heuristic soft computing based control techniques, in this paper various commonly used intelligent techniques, neural network, fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been combined with sliding mode controller (SMC). For validation, proposed hybrid control schemes have been implemented for tracking a predefined trajectory by robotic manipulator, incorporating structured and unstructured uncertainties in the system. After reviewing numerous papers, all the commonly occurring uncertainties like continuous disturbance, uniform random white noise, static friction like coulomb friction and viscous friction, dynamic friction like Dhal friction and LuGre friction have been inserted in the system. Various performance indices like norm of tracking error, chattering in control input, norm of input torque, disturbance rejection, chattering rejection have been used. Comparative results show that with almost eliminated chattering the intelligent SMC controllers are found to be more efficient over simple SMC. It has also been observed from results that ANFIS based controller has the best tracking performance with the reduced burden on the system.

Using a standard benchmark data from a cloud intrusion detection dataset experiments are done, tested, and compared with other existing approaches in terms of detection rate accuracy, precision, recall, MSE, and scalability. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Clustering algorithms; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithm; Hybrid intelligent systems; Intrusion detection","Access control; Clustering algorithms; Digital storage; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Intelligent systems; Mercury (metal); Access control policies; Authentication techniques; Cloud environments; Detection rates; Hybrid intelligent system; Intrusion detection approaches; Intrusion Detection Systems; On-demand services; Intrusion detection","Raja, S.; Department of Information Technology, PSNA College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: rsivakami@psnacet.edu.in",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,,"English","Int.

MANETs do not use any centralized administration for communication. The performance of a MANET can be further enhanced by adapting a cluster mechanism with the help of CEAACK to provide security from penetrators. In this paper we propose a new improved ant colony optimization algorithm with two strategies to reduce the overhead in communication by predicting mobility of node and cluster formation. Firstly, a dynamic mechanism is designed for determining one or more heuristic parameters for improving the performance of the MANET. Secondly a dynamic list of nodes are maintained which helps in forming clusters and electing the cluster head faster. In addition a dynamic broadcast approach algorithm is incorporated to provide the information about the status of the nodes to the hybrid fuzzy-ant colony algorithm. This approach ensures low maintenance cost and is expected to be robust against node failures and network topology changes. The positive outcome of these two techniques consumes low energy and in the process provides better efficiency in data transmission in MANETs. It also achieves correct delivery of packets without unnecessary delay. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Base station; Cluster; Clustered enhanced adaptive acknowledgment (CEAACK); Dynamic broadcast; Fuzzy logic; Improved ant colony; Mobile ad hoc NETwork (MANET); Mobility prediction","Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Telecommunication networks; Ant colonies; Cluster; Clustered enhanced adaptive acknowledgment (CEAACK); Dynamic broadcasts; Mobility predictions; Mobile ad hoc networks","Ramakrishnan, B.; Department of Computer Science and Research Centre, S.T.

The considered IHPS model is comprised of a wind turbine generator, a diesel engine generator and an energy storage device (such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), in this case). Traditionally, SF, membership functions and control rules are obtained in fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) by trial and error method or are obtained based on the experiences of the designers or are optimized by some traditional optimization techniques with some extra computational cost. To overcome all these problems of FLCs, classical controllers have been integrated in this paper with the FLC. QOHS algorithm is applied to simultaneously tune the SFs (the only tunable parameter of FLC), the gains of the classical controllers and the tunable parameters of the SMES device to minimize frequency and power deviations of the studied IHPS system against various load demand and wind change. Different considered controller configurations of the IHPS are SF based FLC (termed as Fuzzy-only), SF based FLC with proportional-integral (PI) (named as Fuzzy-PI) controller, SF based FLC with proportional-derivative (PD) (abbreviated as Fuzzy-PD) controller and SF based FLC with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) (designated as Fuzzy-PID) controller. Simulation results, explicitly, show that the performance of the Fuzzy-PID controller based IHPS is superior to Fuzzy-only, Fuzzy-PI and Fuzzy-PD controller based IHPS configuration in terms of overshoot, settling time and the proposed Fuzzy-PID controller is robust against various wide range of load changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Classical controllers; Frequency; Fuzzy logic controller; Harmony search; Power; Quasi-opposition","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Diesel engines; Electric control equipment; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric power system control; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Identification (control systems); Magnetic storage; Membership functions; Optimization; Power control; Proportional control systems; Superconducting magnets; Three term control systems; Traffic signals; Turbogenerators; Two term control systems; Water craft; Wind turbines; Classical controllers; Frequency; Fuzzy logic controllers; Harmony search; Power; Quasi-opposition; Controllers","Ganguly, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Bankura Unnayani Instute of EngineeringIndia; email: somnath_aec82@yahoo.co.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",22106502,,,,"English","Swarm Evol.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of Ki-67 score or labelling index, by estimating the fraction of Ki67 positively stained tumour cells, is the most widely practiced method to assess tumour proliferation (Dowsett et al. 2011). Accurate manual counting of these cells (specifically nuclei) due to complex and dense distribution of cells, therefore, becomes critical and presents a major challenge to pathologists. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid clustering algorithm to quantify the proliferative index of breast cancer cells based on automated counting of Ki-67 nuclei. The proposed methodology initially pre-processes the IHC images of Ki-67 stained slides of breast cancer. The RGB images are converted to grey, L*a*b*, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. All the stained cells are then characterized by two stage segmentation process. Fuzzy C-means quantifies all the stained cells as one cluster. The blue channel of the first stage output is given as input to k-means algorithm, which provides separate cluster for Ki-67 positive and negative cells. The count of positive and negative nuclei is used to calculate the F-measure for each colour space. A comparative study of our work with the expert opinion is studied to evaluate the error rate. The positive and negative nuclei detection results for all colour spaces are compared with the ground truth for validation and F-measure is calculated. The F-measure for L*a*b* colour space (0.8847) provides the best statistical result as compared to grey, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. Further, a study is carried out to count nuclei manually and automatically from the proposed algorithm with an average error rate of 6.84% which is significant. The study provides an automated count of positive and negative nuclei using L*a*b*colour space and hybrid segmentation technique. Computerized evaluation of proliferation index can aid pathologist in assessing breast cancer severity. The proposed methodology, further, has the potential advantage of saving time and assisting in decision making over the present manual procedure and could evolve as an assistive pathological decision support system. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Breast cancer; Fuzzy C-means; Immunohistochemistry; k-means; Ki-67 protein; Proliferation index","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Cells; Color; Cytology; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Fuzzy systems; Medical imaging; Proteins; Tumors; Breast Cancer; Fuzzy C mean; Immunohistochemistry; K-means; Proliferation index; Clustering algorithms; Ki 67 antigen; Ki 67 antigen; algorithm; analytical error; Article; automation; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; color; comparative study; decision support system; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; methodology; proliferative index; protein expression; quantitative analysis; validation study; automation; breast tumor; female; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; prognosis; theoretical model; Algorithms; Automation; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Ki-67 Antigen; Models, Theoretical; Prognosis","Chakraborty, C.; School of Medical Science & Technology, IIT KharagpurIndia; email: chandanc@smst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28187885","English","Comput.

Irrelevant features may also cause overfitting and reduce interpretability of the concerned model. It is, therefore, important that the features are optimally selected before a model is built. In the case of online learning, new instances are periodically discovered, and the respective model is tactically retrained as required. Similarly, there are many real-life situations where hundreds of new features are discovered periodically, and the existing model needs to be retrained or tested for its performance improvement. Supervised selection of feature subset usually requires creation of multiple suboptimal models, thus incurring time-intensive computations. Unsupervised selections, although faster, largely rely on some subjective definition of feature relevance. In this paper, we introduce a score that accurately determines the importance of the features. The proposed score is appropriate for online feature selection scenarios for its low time complexity and ability to interpret performance improvement of the current model after the addition of a new feature, without invoking a retraining. © 2012 IEEE.","Entropy; Feature selection; Model; Online feature selection (OFS); Principal component analysis (PCA); Training","Decision making; Current modeling; Feature relevance; Interpretability; Model performance; Online feature selection; Online learning; Scoring schemes; Time complexity; Feature extraction",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",2162237X,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Most of the state-of-the-art CBMIR systems suffer from various problems: computationally expensive due to the usage of high dimensional feature vectors and complex classifier/clustering schemes. Inability to properly handle the “semantic gap” and the high intra-class versus inter-class variability problem of the medical image database (like radiographic image database). This yields an exigent demand for developing highly effective and computationally efficient retrieval system. Methods We propose a novel interactive two-stage CBMIR system for diverse collection of medical radiographic images. Initially, Pulse Coupled Neural Network based shape features are used to find out the most probable (similar) image classes using a novel “similarity positional score” mechanism. This is followed by retrieval using Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform based texture features considering only the images of the pre-identified classes. Maximal information compression index is used for unsupervised feature selection to achieve better results. To reduce the semantic gap problem, the proposed system uses a novel fuzzy index based relevance feedback mechanism by incorporating subjectivity of human perception in an analytic manner. Results Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CBMIR system on a subset of Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA)-2009 database consisting of 10,902 labeled radiographic images of 57 different modalities. We obtained overall average precision of around 98% after only 2–3 iterations of relevance feedback mechanism. We assessed the results by comparisons with some of the state-of-the-art CBMIR systems for radiographic images. Conclusions Unlike most of the existing CBMIR systems, in the proposed two-stage hierarchical framework, main importance is given on constructing efficient and compact feature vector representation, search-space reduction and handling the “semantic gap” problem effectively, without compromising the retrieval performance. Experimental results and comparisons show that the proposed system performs efficiently in the radiographic medical image retrieval field. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Content based medical image retrieval; Fuzzy logic; Multiscale geometric analysis; Pulse couple neural network; Radiographic images; Relevance feedback","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Content based retrieval; Database systems; Diagnosis; Feedback control; Fuzzy logic; Hierarchical systems; Image enhancement; Image retrieval; Information retrieval; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Medical information systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Vector spaces; Content based medical image retrieval; Image retrieval in medical applications; Multi-scale geometric analysis; Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms; Radiographic images; Relevance feedback; Subjectivity of human perception; Unsupervised feature selection; Search engines; classifier; comparative effectiveness; compression; data base; diagnosis; experimental model; feedback system; fuzzy logic; human; image retrieval; nervous system; perception; quantitative study; visual information; fuzzy logic; information retrieval; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval","Chowdhury, M.; Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: st.manishc@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"28187892","English","Comput.

But, in case of renewable energy based microgrids, the inherent involvement of static power electronics based power conversion raises the issues of poor power quality and instability during uncertainties due to lack of effective control facility and sufficient moment of inertia. So, an attractive way of mitigating the above mentioned key concerns is to make the microgrid's operation similar to rotary electrical machines based power plant by retaining the advantages of using power electronic converter. With this idea, this paper proposes 'Virtual Synchronous Motor (SM)-Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based Automatic Control Strategy (VSMIGC)' for microgrids. This provides controlled modulating signals to control the output of the pulse width modulated power electronic inverter used in microgrids. For the performance analysis of the proposed VSMIGC, various power quality indices are measured during uncertainties and compared with those of conventional 'Voltage-Current Control Strategy (VIC)' based inverters with respect to standard limits.

Buck converters are significantly sensitive to input, parametric and load perturbations. The intrusion of mismatched uncertainties due to load changes make the controller design task a challenging issue. Hence, a feedback control law based on the adaptive backstepping control technique integrated with a single layer type II Chebyshev neural network (CNN) is proposed. The distinctive feature of the type II CNN is its quick and accurate estimation of time varying load disturbance which is thereafter utilized for subsequent compensation in the control law. The neural networks are trained online using a Lyapunov based learning algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed control is studied for wide variations in load resistance, input voltage and reference voltage and compared against control using conventional adaptive backstepping method. Simulations are performed in MATLAB tool and experimentation is conducted using dSPACE DS1103 setup with TM320F240 DSP.

Analysis performed on 'dirty' data may lead to erroneous insights and thereby shaping decisions poorly. The aspect of big data that deals with its correctness is known as big data veracity. Trusting the data acquired goes a long way in implementing decisions from an automated decision-making system and veracity helps to validate the data acquired. In this paper, we present our solution to the big data veracity problem using crowdsourcing techniques. Our solution involves the use of sentiment analysis, which deals with identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. As a proof of concept, we have developed an app that requires users to tag tweets as per the sentiment it evokes in them. Each tweet would therefore get ratified by hundreds of our participants and the sentiment associated to the tweet gets tagged. The tagged emotion was then evaluated against the verified emotion as compared to a verified data set. This analysis was then plotted on a ROC curve and also evaluated against verified data using a Bayesian predictor trained with a trinomial function. As can be seen, an accuracy of 81% was obtained as displayed by the ROC curve and 89% through the Bayesian predictor. Also, a MAP analysis of the Bayesian predictor yields neutral sentiment as the most probable hypothesis. By doing this, we have proven that crowdsourcing of sentiment analysis is a viable solution to the problem of big data veracity and therefore an aid in making better decisions. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayesian predictor; Big data; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Tweet mining","Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Data mining; Decision making; Learning systems; Automated decision making systems; Bayesian; Map analysis; Proof of concept; ROC curves; Sentiment analysis; Tweet minings; Viable solutions; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The classification is done on product features based on unsupervised SentiWordNet method. In this method we are taking Adjective, Adverb, Verb, Noun as opinion words and negation rules are used for classification of reviews into positive and negative. Proposed method gives 84% accuracy compared to general SentiWordNet method. The feature summarized reviews helps customers to analyze interesting features on products. © 2016 IEEE.","feature Extraction; MongoDB; NoSQL; POS tagger; sentiment classification","Behavioral research; Commerce; Computational linguistics; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Extraction; Feature extraction; Sales; Decision making process; MongoDB; NoSQL; Online customer reviews; Online product reviews; PoS taggers; Sentiment classification; Unsupervised method; Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

The major factor to be considered while employing transformerless inverters in such applications is the leakage currents. The lack of transformers in inverters, implemented between PV panel and grid results in a galvanic connection and thus there arises problems due to leakage currents. This paper deals with an H6 transformerless full-bridge inverter topology with low leakage currents that can be used in PV grid tied applications. This H6 inverter topology is taken as an example for detail analysis with operation modes and modulation strategy. A closed loop has been developed for maintaining the voltage constant at the grid side irrespective of changes in the input voltage. Aforementioned transformerless topology is simulated for evaluating the performances in terms of power efficiency and leakage currents characteristics and a prototype for the H6 inverter topology is also built. © 2016 IEEE.","Common-mode voltage; grid-tied inverter; leakage current; photovoltaic (PV) generation system; transformerless inverter","Electric inverters; Photovoltaic cells; Topology; Common mode voltage; Full-bridge inverters; grid-tied inverter; Inverter topologies; Low-leakage current; Modulation strategy; Photovoltaic generation; Transformerless inverters; Leakage currents",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

In this project, we propose to use a touch pad to construct a HAM radio interface. Low-power, short-range wireless communication interfaces which have become available with modern microcontrollers enable the construction of such systems which can allow users to exchange information within buildings. While Morse code was invented for telegraphy, its simplicity allows a person with physical disability to use it more effectively than a keyboard-based interface. Thus, such an interface can be useful in rehab centers, old-age homes and hospitals. Security systems are yet another domain where Morse code can be gainfully employed. Since the user must make use of touch, drag and release operations for Morse code signaling, it is difficult to prescribe any strict guidelines on the length of the drag or the time gap between two drags. Multiple users of the system will use the system at different speeds. We propose the use of Fuzzy logic with elements of machine learning to reduce the chances of misinterpreting the Morse code and adapting to different users. In order to demonstrate our project, we used the MSP430F5529 development kit from Texas Instruments which comes with a touch-pad, an LCD screen and an RF interface.

When building wireless sensor networks network there is critical issues are emerged such as preserving energy and load balancing. Lifetime of a sensor network is enhanced by implementing and mitigating energy consumption. Number of various parameters such as number of nodes, strength and range of area as well as connectivity of nodes in the network are responsible for the lifetime of network. Energy of battery is most important things for sensor nodes in wireless sensor network. Efficient energy is major part of in mitigate the overhead as well as limited transmission and aggregating data is also important for the enhancing network lifetime. We proposed a clustering routing protocol CRT2FLACO on the basis of type-2 fuzzy logic as well as ACO for balancing the network load and to enhance the lifetime of WSN. Our proposed protocol determines the three fundamental parts of residual energy, neighbor nodes as well as the distance to base station as inputs of a type-2 Mamdani FLS and after that calculate the possibility of a node upgrading as a candidate cluster head and the cluster head competition radius. Implementation of type-2 fuzzy logic is better way to control the overhead existing in WSN. Load of network is efficiently handled by fuzzy unequal competition radius as well as implementation of multi-hop routing protocol technique for data transmission. Additionally, security of data is determined by utilizing encryption algorithm in transmission of data. Network lifetime is enhanced due to system has high packet delivery rates. © 2016 IEEE.","ant colony optimization; clustering algorithm; type-2 fuzzy logic; Wireless sensor network","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cryptography; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Historic preservation; Internet protocols; Network routing; Optimization; Power management; Routing protocols; Security of data; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering routing protocol; Encryption algorithms; Energy-aware routing; Lifetime of networks; Multi-hop routing; Network lifetime; Transmission of data; Type-2 fuzzy logic; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

PV, Fuel cells are considered as the two DG units for this system. Generally Inverter based micro grids plays a key role in accommodating the growth of electricity needs due to this, controlling of inverter is essential, basic droop control methods are conventionally used to control the parallel inverters, predominantly for the low voltage distribution network opposite droop method is the best choice, but this method is also not effective for nonlinear loads, to compensate nonlinear loads also in a effective way virtual impedance is usually implemented as the time derivative of the inverter output current, yet this makes the system highly sensitive to the output current noise and to non linear loads with high slew rate. In order to avoid this a second order general integrator scheme is proposed to implement the virtual output impedance, which is less sensitive to output current noise, reduces the total harmonic distortion and to achieve more accuracy in power sharing and stability. Different linear and nonlinear loads are also connected to verify how the parallel inverters are working with two DC sources connected in islanding mode. Matlab/Simulink is used to validate the proposed control. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed generation; droop control; Fuel cell; Micro grid; parallel inverter; PV Cell","Distributed power generation; Energy management; Fuel cells; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Power management; Voltage distribution measurement; Distributed generation system; Droop control; Low voltage distribution network; Micro grid; Parallel inverter; Pv cells; Second-order general integrators (SOGIs); Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

Additionally to make decisions the attributes of all the departments are required. But the departments are not able to disclose the privacy of data owner. Therefore to combine the data attributes and mining of the combined data need a privacy preserving technique for preventing the privacy issues in a centralize database.

Thus the method vertically data combination, cryptography and decision mining is demonstrated. To mine the decisions from the data a C4.5 decision tree is used.

While performing data mining over large set of data there are chances of privacy violation, loss of information, loss of privacy of individuals. While concentrating only on preserving privacy can increase inefficiency and complexity of data mining techniques. Techniques used for achieving privacy lead to a significant information loss.

Such containers are becoming increasingly popular in developer community as they facilitate fast development and delivery of enterprise class Cloud services. Furthermore, these containers share a common OS and hence, they have a low resource foot-print leading to reduced provisioning time. In this paper, we investigate such promise of containers while provisioning large scale 3-tier applications. First, through benchmarking, we observe that at very large scale, several application scaling factors (e.g., number of containers of an application provisioned in parallel, application load) and system state parameters (e.g., number of applications and containers running on a system) introduce variability in application provisioning time because of resource bottleneck in general, and specifically due to the OS process overhead. To address such variability, we propose a provisioning decision management system SCoPe that provides an application partitioning and provisioning strategy where we determine the maximum number of containers of every application that can be provisioned in parallel across physical machines, while meeting the service level agreement (SLA) on provisioning time and Cloud provider specific objectives (e.g., maximize consolidation of applications, minimize operating cost). This joint partitioning and provisioning problem is NP-hard and we propose a greedy heuristic solution. Using real data set and through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the performance of SCoPe for large scale container based application provisioning. Compared to other well-known heuristics, SCoPe can reduce the partitioning by 5x or more, while meeting SLAs. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Cloud computing; Containers; Data flow analysis; Decision making; Application partitioning; Application provisioning; Cloud environments; Decision management system; Joint partitioning; Process-level virtualization; Service Level Agreements; System state parameters; Benchmarking",,"Foster I.Radia N.Foster I.","IEEE Computer Society",21596182,9781509026197,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Mainly WSN was used for military arena but now a days it is used in various area like industrial applications, consumer applications, health care applications and many more. Despite of having many advantages there are some issues also occurred in WSNs like hotspot problem, energy hole problem, routing, coverage problem, load balancing problem and so on. These issues effect on different factors of WSN named energy consumption, stability, quality, deployment time, lifetime of network, which degrade the performance of the WSN. To solve these issues various researchers develop different mechanisms. Among all of them, in this paper, we survey different kind of soft computing paradigms.

The classical concept of fuzzy logic provides the means to represent approximate knowledge. Therefore the elements which lie in the boundaries of several sets are forced to belong to any of the sets. Introduction to fuzzy sets undoubtedly increases the computational burden, so there is an extension into shadowed sets, which takes the essence of fuzzy sets and reduce the computational complexity of the fuzzy sets. Shadowed set is based on three valued logic which represents the concept of full exclusion(0), full participation(1) and uncertain. So a shadowed set comprises of the elements with full participation in the set and those which are uncertain of this set. Here we have used another set theoretic concept named as vague set, it changes the general concept of fuzzy set and it removes the uncertainty of the shadowed set. Each object of this vague set has a grade of membership whose value is a continuous sub interval of [0,1]. In this study we have proposed a set theoretic concept which combines the concept of shadowed set as well as vague set. We use the proposed concept for the clustering of synthetic data sets and real data sets. The experimental results are analyzed by both quantitative and qualitative measures. © 2016 IEEE.","Fuzzy Clustering; Fuzzy Sets; Median Membership; Real Dataset; Shadowed Set; Synthetic Dataset; Vague Set; Vagueness Calculation","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computer circuits; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy sets; Many valued logics; Median Membership; Real Dataset; Shadowed Set; Synthetic Dataset; Vague sets; Fuzzy logic",,"Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509010479,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In spite of so many reforms and initiatives introduced by the government of India in the past decades, the quality of information provided to the marginalized farmer is uneven. Dangerous issues that infect Indian farming at hand are the data shortage and high risk because of the volatile nature of the factors involved, like, natural weather change. This paper introduces an advisory, information and financial system available on mobiles, which is designed for farmers to help them stay on track, avoid troubles, and receive all the latest and updated information, government schemes and strategies related to the field of agriculture. Information System has tools forecasting schedule that creates a systematic schedule for farmers for crop cultivation based on the weather predictions. This proposed idea is to ensure that the farmer plan their resources properly and also suggest a sequence of tactical decisions throughout a production cycle. The advisory system will enable its users to receive real-time and interactive advices and alerts on crop. Alerts would include phase of the plantation, weather conditions, diseases and nutrition. Farmers will also receive regular weather bulletins to support on-farm decision-making. Finance related tools, helps the farmer to keep track and control his financial income and expenses. It helps the farmer to get better control of his financial condition, productivity. In turn it will help him to increase profitability and fulfill their long-term goals. This paper is a start of a complete solution for addressing Indian farmer's needs, which would help them grow systematically. © 2016 IEEE.","Advisory system; Crop Schedule; Information system; Weather prediction and financial tools","Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Expert systems; Finance; Forecasting; Information systems; Multitasking; Scheduling algorithms; Weather forecasting; Advisory systems; Complete solutions; Financial tools; Government of India; Quality of information; Tactical decisions; Updated informations; Weather prediction; Agriculture",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Next, a decision maker (DM) provides a tolerance (α-cut) value based on which a corresponding SQL command is created for the given imprecise query. The query retrieves different result sets from the database for different α-cut values. Finally, it has been shown with suitable examples that neutrosophic set gives accurate result for any kind of uncertain query. © 2016 IEEE.","neutrosophic data; neutrosophic set; similarity measure; α-cut","Data handling; Decision making; Query languages; Decision makers; Imprecise queries; Inconsistent data; Membership values; neutrosophic data; Neutrosophic sets; Similarity measure; Uncertain query; Query processing",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In order to solve these types of queries we may need to use co-operative query languages etc. However using additional query based system incurs extra cost. Moreover, if the criteria in a query are complementary to each other simple SQL queries are not capable of addressing this issue. A query in which multi-criteria decision making is required, often more than a single attribute of the relation is analyzed to fetch the desired result. In this context dominance analysis is performed to obtain a set of points (tuples) those are at least equally good in all the dimensions in compare to other points in the dataset. Skyline points are computed to find points which are not dominated (dominance analysis) by any other point in the system. A point is called 'skyline point' if and only if it is not dominated by any other points in the system. Computation of skyline requires comparison of each point to all the other points in the system which in turn increases complexity. The complexity may increase at exponential rate when the numbers of dimensions increase. This research work focuses on the reduction of computational complexity. It is incorporated here by selecting the most important dimension of the database and transfers the other entire dimension in that form. And finally ranks the points accordingly. © 2016 IEEE.","Complexity Reduction; Decision Making; Multi-dimensional; Skyline Point","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Query languages; Query processing; Alternative solutions; Complexity reduction; Dominance analysis; Exponential rates; Multi criteria decision making; Multi dimensional; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Skyline point; Decision making",,"Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509010479,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Hence there is an earnest need to develop an efficient machine learning classifier that can detect and classify anemia accurately. In this paper five ensemble learning methods : Stacking, Bagging, Voting, Adaboost and Bayesian Boosting are applied on four classifiers : Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network ,Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor .The aim is to determine which individual classifier or subset of classifier combination achieves maximum accuracy in Red blood cell classification for anemia detection. From the results it is evident that amongst the ensemble methods, stacking ensemble method achieves the highest accuracy. Amongst the individual classifier the Artificial Neural Network performs the best and K-Nearest Neighbor performs the worst. However the classifier combination Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor when applied on Stacking ensemble, achieves an accuracy much higher than the Artificial Neural Network.This indicates an ensemble of classifiers achieves much higher accuracy than individual classifiers .Hence to achieve maximum accuracy in medical decision making an ensemble of classifiers should be used . © 2016 IEEE.","Anemia; Ensemble learning; Red blood cells; Stacking; Voting","Adaptive boosting; Blood; Cells; Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Anemia; Ensemble learning; Red blood cell; Stacking; Voting; Decision making",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Some important applications of WSN are military, machine surveillance, preventive maintenance, disaster relief operations etc. In this type of network, routing is a little bit more complex as compared to ordinary wireless or wired networks. The routing protocols those are applied for different types of the other networks cannot be used here because here in WSN, nodes are battery powered. Due to this, WSN should be the energy efficient. Entire network lifetime is depending on efficient energy consumption in sensor network. Clustering is one of the techniques to utilize the energy of network efficiently. This method consumes extra communication overhead in exchanging messes for selecting appropriate cluster head. This type of transmission of message from node to node consumes extra energy that makes energy resources inefficient. This paper provides an approach to prolong the WSN lifetime using fuzzy logic based selection of cluster head that provides completely non probabilistic approach. This approach uses two fuzzy variables: Base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. In this approach multi-hop communication is used. One cluster Head (CH) has the authority to communicate with the other CH and also with the BS. Simulation result verifies the proposed approach in prolonging the WSNs network lifetime. © 2016 IEEE.","Cluster head; Fuzzy logic; Non-probabilistic approach; Wireless sensor network(WSN)","Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer circuits; Disaster prevention; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Military applications; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Preventive maintenance; Sensor nodes; Cluster head; Communication overheads; Disaster relief operations; Energy efficient; Multi hop communication; Network lifetime; Non-probabilistic; Residual energy; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The FD-ADC is suitable for low power applications and where the input signal swing is small. FD-ADC also needs very less amount of voltage supply in order to operate. The FD-ADC block uses a back-To-back voltage-To-Time conversion circuit, which can be used in Time-Analog-To-Digital (TAD) converter. This TAD converter consists of a series of cascaded inverter circuits (delay elements) which increases delays in the process of conversion. The delay elements here play a vital role in the digitization of analog inputs where the input signal's amplitude variation is converted to the variation of the delay with the help of these delay elements and then the digitization of delay is carried out in order to get the final digital outputs.

In some cases, more than one clock cycle is required to perform a predictable action. Clock Circuits are responsible for proportionate fraction of the power dissipation of a chip and are important in terms of performance. In integrated circuit, multiple supply voltages are utilized for reducing the power consumption by a sub- circuit. A sub circuit supply voltage is used to generate an output signal at a Lower Supply Voltage for another sub circuit and is generated from a higher supply voltage, and this achieves reduction of the power consumption by the sub circuit. Since an output signal generated by the sub circuit is a lower voltage signal, at the front stage of an output circuit, a level conversion circuit transform the level of this signal into a signal for the higher external supply voltage and Vice versa .

Conventional space-vector PWM keeps dwell times of redundant states equal which reduces the Total harmonic distortion (THD) significantly. A general method to calculate the CM offset to implement the SVPWM using carrier-based approach is derived in this paper. Also, a generalized expression for the CM offset with varying weightage to the redundant switching states has been derived.

The proposed mechanism commences with colour space conversion of RGB query images to L*a*b* triplets and further application of PC generates relevant feature information. The ensuing visual features are blended by fuzzy rules to formulate the unified feature histograms and later fuzzy quantised to produce two feature descriptors termed as PC-based colour edge directivity descriptor (PC-CEDD), PC-based fuzzy colour texture histogram (PC-FCTH). The resulting descriptors occupy minimal storage space of 23–74 bytes per image, with 60% reduction in feature extraction time in comparison with CEDD, FCTH. Relative precision–recall and mean average precision (MAP) analysis of the intended feature histograms on medical, texture, and object picture dataset signify the improvement in retrieval performance. Furthermore, average normalised modified retrieval rank analysis of the intended descriptors reveals the better matching quality of the given query image. © 2017 The Royal Photographic Society.","ANMRR; FET; PC-CEDD; PC-FCTH; Phase congruency","Color; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Graphic methods; Image analysis; Quality control; ANMRR; Compact Features; Feature descriptors; Image indexing and retrieval; Phase congruency; Relevant features; Retrieval performance; Storage spaces; Image retrieval","Sudhakar, M.S.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: sudhakar.ms@vit.ac.in",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13682199,,,,"English","Imag.

An efficient energy management strategy for smart homes results in minimized electricity consumption leading to cost savings. Towards this goal, we investigate the impact of environmental factors on home energy consumption. Home energy demand is observed to be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and humidity which are inherently uncertain. Analyzing the impact of these factors on electricity consumption is challenging due to the unpredictability of weather conditions and non-linear relationship between environmental factors and electricity demand. For demand estimation based on these time varying factors, a hybrid intelligent system is developed that integrates the adaptability of neural networks and reasoning of fuzzy systems to predict daily electricity demand. A smart home dataset is utilized to build an unsupervised artificial neural network known as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). We further develop a fuzzy rule based system from the SOM to predict home energy demand. Evaluation of the system shows a strong correlation between home energy demand and environmental factors and that the system predicts home energy consumption with higher accuracy.

State space model of CSC converter in ON and OFF states were developed using the Kirchhoff laws. The state space matrices were used to construct the transfer functions of ON & OFF states.

The characteristic parameters such as rise time, overshoot, settling time, steady state error and stability were determined using the step response curve. The response curve shows that there is no overshoot; the rise time and settling time are very low as expected for a converter and its stability is very high but the amplitude is very. The circuit was tuned to attain the expected amplitude using PID controller with the help of Genetic algorithm. The excellent results of circuits' characteristic parameters are very useful guideline for constructing such CSC converters for DC-DC conversions.

The fuzzy inference system takes multiple interrelated QoS parameters such as residual bandwidth (RB), residual energy (RE), link loss ratio (LLR), end-to-end delay (D), number of intermediate nodes (N) and link expiration time (LET) to find a strong node from a set of mobile nodes. A node can be classified as strong when the fuzzy cost probability (FCP) is high otherwise it is classified as a weak node. The proposed fuzzy cost probability-based multi-constrained QoS multicast routing (FCPMQMR) consists of two phases. The first phase performs the selection of forwarding node using fuzzy logic technique. The second phase builds a stable backbone mesh structure. In case of node failure, an alternative path from the primary route through another forwarding node is selected for communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FCPMQMR improves the packet delivery ratio by 5%-10% success ratio by 35%, and decreases the average end-to-end delay by 10%-15% and control overhead by 45%.

It is due to the fact that the FMS consists of machines with high flexibility that can process a variety of jobs in a number of machines. Basically, such systems are used for the batch production process. In aerospace industries where a batch production process is adopted, FMS has found a wide range of application there. It is evident that due to such highly flexible and complicated systems the shop floor control of the FMS becomes quite a difficult task. Hence, there is a need of a decision-making approach which can ensure a proper control of the systems. The decision-making approaches refers to taking of the right decision at the right time regarding the planning, scheduling, dispatching and certain decisions related to disturbances in shop floor like urgent job arrivals, tool failure and machine breakdown. The proper decision making ensures a proper operation of the FMS, but due to such complex configuration, the decision-making in such systems becomes quite a challenging task. Hence, to execute it properly the decision-making activity consists of various steps like collection of data from the shop floor, appealing the decisionmaking activity, evaluation of the alternatives, finding the best alternative among them and finally the execution of the decisions. This paper deals with the theory behind the various decisionmaking approaches that are used for the FMS control. A detailed analysis is done and various situations are generated and its effects are studied. A real-time FMS problem is solved by using various decision-making approaches and its simulation is done by using ARENA simulation software. The results are finally analyzed and compared to see the changes of the effects of the decision making with that one where no such decision-making approaches are used. Finally, the graphical interpretation is done for the results. © 2017 IEEE.","Aerospace industries; ARENA; Decision-making; Dispatching; FMS; Planning; Scheduling","Aerospace industry; Computer software; Fermium; Flexible manufacturing systems; Floors; Planning; Scheduling; ARENA; Batch production process; Complex configuration; Complicated systems; Design and operations; Dispatching; Graphical interpretations; Shop floor Control; Decision making",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model has been used to represent the nonlinear system and design the fuzzy controller. The Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) has been used with sliding mode control to design the controller, with an aim to improve the performance of the system by output tracking with disturbance rejection. The proposed controller is better than the conventional PDC based fuzzy controller and has better output tracking efficiency robustness. The proposed methodology has been successfully employed for the well-established benchmark nonlinear system, viz., inverted pendulum on cart.

Fuzzy logic control architecture which is placed in the vehicle has been designed to take appropriate decision based on the various parameters inside the vehicle. Number of input and output parameters and rules of operation can be varied easily in the fuzzy logic toolbox in MATLAB. The output will be sent to the micro-controller using RS232 serial communication. Now the micro-controller will take the appropriate action to execute the command received. So in order to communicate with other vehicle we have used GPS receiver which will transmit the current position of the vehicle to nearby vehicle ranging within 30 or 100 m using Zigbee communication in a common transmission frequency. If there is any vehicles present in this range it will accept and communicate back by sending the corresponding GPS location of that vehicle and the path of its course. If it is found to be moving on the same direction or path a communication with the vehicle will be established and data will be transmitted among them to achieve the safe and smooth traffic travel to increase the vehicle efficiency. The same rules will apply if there is more than one vehicle is present in the transmitting range. All these transmitting data will be privacy protected. We have successfully controlled prototype model and found that architecture is working autonomously up to the expectation and provides efficient travel for the vehicle. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Arduino; Fuzzy logic; GPS; Matlab; Robot; Zigbee","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Controllers; Fuzzy logic; Global positioning system; Intelligent computing; MATLAB; Microcontrollers; Reconfigurable hardware; Reinforcement learning; Robots; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Zigbee; Arduino; Fuzzy logic control; Fuzzy Logic Toolbox; Quantum reinforcement learning; Serial communications; Transmission frequencies; Vehicle efficiency; ZigBee communications; Vehicle to vehicle communications","Mohan, A.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, CEG Campus, Anna UniversityIndia; email: arjunragavendh@gmail.com","Dash S.S.Deiva Sundari P.Das S.Panigrahi B.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811016448,,,"English","Adv.

One of the problems confronted during optimization is clustering problem. Input for a clustering process is a set of data which are then organized into a number of sub-groups. Modern studies have recommended that partitioned or segregated clustering algorithms are more appropriate for clustering of wide and huge datasets. One of the most frequent partitional clustering algorithms is K-Means. K-means algorithm shows a more rapid convergence than PSO but then against local optimal area is generally trapped depending on the random values of initial centroids. An efficient hybrid method is presented in this paper, namely particle swarm optimization with fuzzy logic or adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) to resolve data clustering problem. The PSO algorithm does find a good or near optimal solution in reasonable time, but its presentation was enhanced by seeding the initial swarm with fuzzifier function. The adaptive fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithm (APSO) is compared with k-means using total execution time and clustering group error. It is discovered that the total execution time for APSO method outperforms the k-means and had higher solution quality in terms of clustering group error. © 2016 IEEE.","Fuzzy Logic; K-Means; Particle Swarm Optimization","Cluster analysis; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Adaptive particle swarm optimizations; Clustering problems; Clustering process; K-means; Near-optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Partitional clustering algorithm; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509028078,,,"English","Int.

The dynamic voltage restorer is one of the custom power devices designed to inject a voltage in series with line to present a pure sinusoidal voltage of the desired RMS value to the sensitive loads, if the supply side is affected by voltage disturbances. The design and implementation of a DVR with a quasi-impedance source inverter and variable structure control is discussed in this paper. The voltage boosting ability of a quasi-impedance (Z) source inverter is used here to improve the performance of the DVR with reduced energy storage. The control system designed based on variable structure control effectively supports the DVR with good dynamic response, even under parameter variations. Performance of the proposed system in a single phase network is evaluated against the conventional DVR system using MATLAB simulation studies.

We contribute to the theoretical analysis of MDP planning, which is the problem of computing an optimal policy for a given MDP. Specifically, we furnish improved strong worstcase upper bounds on the running time of MDP planning. Strong bounds are those that depend only on the number of states n and the number of actions k in the specified MDP; they have no dependence on affiliated variables such as the discount factor and the number of bits needed to represent the MDP. Worst-case bounds apply to every run of an algorithm; randomised algorithms can typically yield faster expected running times. While the special case of 2-action MDPs (that is, k = 2) has recently received some attention, bounds for general k have remained to be improved for several decades. Our contributions are to this general case. For k ≥ 3, the tightest strong upper bound shown to date for MDP planning belongs to a family of algorithms called Policy Iteration. This bound is only a polynomial improvement over a trivial bound of poly(n, k) · kn [Mansour and Singh, 1999]. In this paper, we generalise a contrasting algorithm called the Fibonacci Seesaw, and derive a bound of poly(n, k) · k0.6834n. The key construct that we use is a template to map algorithms for the 2-action setting to the general setting. Interestingly, this idea can also be used to design Policy Iteration algorithms with a running time upper bound of poly(n, k)·k0.7207n. Both our results improve upon bounds that have stood for several decades.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Reinforcement learning; Discount factors; MAP algorithms; Markov decision problem; Number of state; Optimal policies; Policy iteration; Randomised algorithms; Sequential decision making; Iterative methods",,"Sierra C.","International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence",10450823,9780999241103,,,"English","IJCAI Int.

Manipur, one of the state of North east India, comes under the Purvachal ranges of Himalaya. The topography of the state is rugged and more than 90% of the total geographic area is hilly terrain. Land degradation assessments becomes a trending way to responds to the environmental concerns in the developing region as it effects significantly on their agriculture and food security. Degradation of the land resources in this part of North Eastern India is quite rapid and prevalent due to various anthropogenic, natural and climatic factors. According to the NRSC report on desertification and land degradation atlas, 2011, 25.74% of the total geographical area of the state comes under the category of vegetation degradation. This paper explore the applicability of the methodology which is based on Land Degradation Assessment in drylands (LADA) to delineate different type of degraded land in the region using remote sensing based derived indices and controlling factors that directly/indirectly triggers the degradation of land resources of the region. In this study, Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation index (EVI) and Drought index (DI) are considered as the controlling variables for mapping the region susceptible to land degradation. The satellite data product (having high spatial and temporal scale) employed in this study was generated or synthesize using Spatio-temporal image fusion model (STI-FM) of the Landsat-8 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance.

Feature subset selection is an important task in pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems. The generalization performance of the system is not only depending on optimal features but also dependent upon the classifier (learning algorithm). Therefore, it is an important task to select a fast and efficient classifier. Research efforts have affirmed that extreme learning machine (ELM) has superior and accurate classification ability. However, ELM is failed to handle the uncertain data. One of the alternative solutions is fuzzy-ELM, which combines the advantages of fuzzy logic and ELM. GA-FELM is able to handle curse of dimensionality problem, optimization problem and weighted classification problem with maximizing classification accuracy by minimizing the number of features. In order to validate the efficiency of GA-FELM, the comparative performance is evaluated by using three different approaches viz. 1. ELM and GA-ELM 2. GA-ELM and GA-FELM 3. GA-FELM and GA-existing classifier. The result analysis shows that classification accuracy is improved with 9% while reducing 62% features. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Feature extraction; Fuzzy logic; Image processing; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Classification accuracy; Comparative performance; Extreme learning machine; Feature subset selection; Generalization performance; Minimizing the number of; Optimal feature subset selections; Parameter optimization techniques; Genetic algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055593,,,"English","Proc.

Presence of malicious or selfish nodes in the routing path will affect the routing performance. In this paper, fuzzy logic based trust-AODV is proposed, which is an enhancement to the existing ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) protocol. The algorithm uses decision factors such as packet forwarding trust (PFT), energy level (EL), and time of availability (ToA) to decide the dynamic changing behaviour of a mobile node. Further, the decision factors are incorporated into Fuzzy logic model to calculate the Final Trust value of a mobile node which is used to establish a cooperative routing path. The simulated results are compared with AODV, dynamic source routing (DSR), TDSR and ad hoc on-demand trusted-path distance vector (AOTDV) algorithms with respect to routing parameters such as packet delivery ratio, average delay, routing packet overhead, and Energy consumption. The simulation results indicate that the proposed routing algorithm improves the routing performance.

It has been used to control home entertainment systems and household activities. One of the main parameters to control in a smart home is the atmospheric comfort. Atmospheric comfort mainly includes temperature and relative humidity. In homes, the desired temperature of different rooms varies from 20 to 25 °C and relative humidity is around 50 %. Hence, automated measurement of these parameters to ensure comfort assumes significance. To achieve this, a fuzzy logic controller using Arduino was developed using MATLAB. In the present work, soft sensor was introduced in this system that can indirectly measure temperature and humidity and can be used for processing several measurements. The Sugeno method was used in the soft sensor in MATLAB and then interfaced to the Arduino, which is again interfaced to the temperature and humidity sensor DHT11. The comfort sensor developed was able to measure temperature and relative humidity correctly. Depending on the comfort percentage, the air conditioners and the coolers in the room were controlled.

But the on-demand clustering approaches proposed so far use equal clustering where clusters are of almost equal size thus, it suffers from the hot spot problem.

A biological system is one of the highly perturbed systems involving various linear as well as nonlinear disturbances. Therefore, it is very important to have an efficient and precise control algorithm for MABP regulation. It is also very important that the control strategy implemented should be robust towards these different kinds of disturbances. Fuzzy logic is known to be an important and efficient control technique in the field of artificial intelligence. It has the capability to handle real world problems in a very efficient manner. Hence, in this paper an attempt has been made to design a fuzzy logic PID controller for the MABP regulation. The performance of the controller is evaluated using the various integral error criterions and further, the comparison has been made with the existing controllers.","Fuzzy logic; Mean arterial blood pressure; PID controller; Sodium nitro prusside","Blood pressure; Computer circuits; Electric control equipment; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent systems; Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; Control strategies; Existing controllers; Fuzzy PID controller; Mean arterial blood pressures; Medical procedures; Nonlinear disturbance; PID controllers; Real-world problem; Controllers",,,"Acta Press",,9780889869929,,,"English","Proc.

This leads to an exponential increase in the possible alternatives available for selecting the set of sites, constituting a query plan, for processing. Computing the optimal query plans, from amongst all possible query plans, is a discrete combinatorial optimization problem. This Distributed Query Plan Generation (DQPG) problem has been addressed using Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) in this paper. Here, a novel BFO based DQPG algorithm (DQPGBFO), which generates the Top-K distributed query plans having the minimum total query processing cost, has been proposed. Experimental comparison of DQPGBFO with the existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) based DQPG algorithm (DQPGGA) shows that the former is able to generate Top-K query plans that have a comparatively lower total cost of processing a distributed query. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in the query response time and thus aids in decision making. © 2017, IGI Global.","Bacterial foraging optimization; Decision making; Distributed databases; Distributed query plan generation; Swarm intelligence",,,,"IGI Global",19478208,,,,"English","International J.

Essentially, the individual elements and their peculiarities are not differentiated with an assumption that the inherent dynamics of the overall system is precisely known to the system modellers. This paper, in contrast, presents a case wherein the system behaviour emerges from the individual elements and their interactions.

However, due to limited knowledge and experience of the health assistants, diagnosis is often ambiguous. Therefore, there is an increasing demand to develop a knowledge based decision-making system to treat the rural patients at primary level. In this paper, a graph based clinical decision support system (CDSS) has been proposed to facilitate the health assistants for provisional disease diagnosis of the patients. The graph-based knowledge base is developed by integrating the medical knowledge represented of different ontologies. We apply the modified depth first search algorithm and topological sort algorithm for achieving minimum cost in graph traversal for differential diagnosis of the diseases.

Unequal clustering is an extension of common clustering that exhibits even better load balancing. Most existing approaches do not consider node density when clustering, which can pose significant problems. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic based cluster head selection approach is proposed, which considers the residual energy, centrality and density of the nodes. In addition, a fuzzy-logic based clustering range assignment approach is used, which considers the suitability and the position of the nodes in assigning the clustering range. Furthermore, a weight function is used to optimize the selection of the relay nodes. The proposed approach was compared with a number of well known approaches by simulation. The results showed that the proposed approach performs better than the other algorithms in terms of lifetime and other metrics. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.","Clustering; Energy aware clustering; Fuzzy logic; Unequal clustering; Wireless sensor network",,,,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",23375787,,,,"English","J.

Information on its temporal changes is very important for crop monitoring and yield estimation which in turn helps for food security and decision making. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is highly suitable for monitoring rice crop, especially in tropical and subtropical areas, where pervasive cloud cover during the rainy seasons prevents the use of optical data. The SAR observations are sensitive to growth stages, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, crop height, soil moisture, and inundation frequency and duration. This makes SAR predominantly useful for mapping rice extent and monitoring rice growth. However, monitoring the rice dynamics requires an intensive multi-temporal data. Dense time series Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data at high spatial resolution offers new opportunities for monitoring agriculture. However, in operational level, several practical problems arise in agricultural monitoring using Sentinel-1 data. It requires processing and management of a large amount of satellite imagery that consequently leads to a ‘Big Data’ problem. In this present work, this problem is overcome with the Google Earth Engine which offers a cloud computing platform to access and seamlessly process a large amount of available satellite imagery. In this present research, time series Sentinel-1A Interferometric Wide (IW) Swath images are utilized to monitor rice crops across Bardhaman district of West Bengal, India. Time series phenological analysis of the Sentinel-1 data is then performed to assess rice information across the test site. The results indicate a low backscatter during transplanting stage due to the inundation. As rice crop grows from tillering to heading, the backscatter response increases proportionally with the increase in biomass. After ripening and near harvesting stage, a decline in backscatter is observed. The results show strong ability of Sentinel-1 data to assess and monitor rice crop for better decision making. © 2017 ACRS.

Existing non-SOA based EAFs are lacking of flexibility, scalability, context sensitivity, re-configurability and agility. On the other hand, existing SOA-based EAFs are merely capable to handle context sensitivity, reusability and agility of Enterprise Information System. To address such issues, this paper proposes a novel SOA-based EAF, called SCORE architecture, comprised of five loosely coupled layers namely, Subject layer, Context layer, Object layer, Role layer and Essence layer. Moreover, a set of relationships are proposed for SCORE architecture to exhibits the intra-layer and inter-layer associations among the constructs of different layers.

Sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station. In recent years, such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas. Generally, sensor nodes are small, cost-effective, memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment. Energy is one of the significant factors in such network. Whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place. Sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster. The purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way. A cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station. An efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption, thereby increasing network lifetime. One major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round, cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region. This process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head. Transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource. In this paper, a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the WSNs lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed. In this, whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (GH) using two fuzzy variables, viz., base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. This approach uses a multi-hop communication approach. GH nodes are authorized to communicate with other GH nodes and base station. Simulation results show that the proposed approach prolongs WSNs network lifetime than existing ones. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Fuzzy logic; Grid head; Non-probabilistic; Wireless sensor networks","Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head selections; Consumption of energy; Environmental conditions; Grid head; Multi hop communication; Non-probabilistic; Processing capability; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Kumar, V.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of TechnologyIndia; email: vimalmnnit16@gmail.com","Sahana S.K.Saha S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811025242,,,"English","Adv.

This Internet-enabled system requires no manual communication or manual-to-computer communication.An IoT framework comprises a sensor layer, a core layer and an application layer. In the present approach, the layers are managed by trust, utilizing a distinctive policy for each layer: self-ordered, efficient routing and manifold service. The proposed work focuses on applying a trust mechanism using a polynomial reduction algorithm. The latter reduces the time taken for the key authentication process between the nodes and the layers. Every trust mechanism has a policy created for the various layers in the trust component. Only the polynomial is sent, without a static key, to create a dynamic key and a verification key for authentication. The trust management only sends the polynomial for the source and, using the source, all nodes create authentication and verification keys. Even between layers, the polynomial is sent from the trust management and using that polynomial the dynamic aut keys and verification keys are generated. A semantic fuzzy algorithm decides in which layer the trust mechanism is necessary, as per the semantic relation among layers and their data transmission. We use 24 nodes for the IoT simulation. Each node has Two Ray ground propagation with an Omni-type antenna. In this environment, the maximum queue length for a packet is 200 and the general routing protocol is the AODV. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Virtualizing the hardware leads to the improvement of resource utilization but it also makes the system over utilized with inefficient performance. Therefore, these VMs need to be migrated to another physical machine using VM consolidation process in order to reduce the amount of host machines and to improve the performance of system. Thus, the idea of placing the virtual machines on some other hosts leads to the proposal of many new algorithms of VM placement. However, the reduced set of physical machines needs the lesser amount of power consumption therefore; in current work the authors have presented a decision making VM placement system based on genetic algorithm and compared it with three predefined VM placement techniques based on classical bin packing. This analysis contributes to better understand the effects of the placement strategies over the overall performance of cloud environment and how the use of genetic algorithm delivers the better results for VM placement than classical bin packing algorithms.

The fuzzy logic system processes the data with help of primary-based bunch set of knowledge. Fuzzy logic closed-loop system having very good successful rate of frame work for decision-based functions, can derive the fuzzy rules to build the decision-making procedure and detect the letters human to system to human. Artificial neural networks are compatible and the best area to solve the pattern cum text recognition tasks. The innovative combinational based characteristic of neural fuzzy-based closed-loop hybrid system proposing a five-layered approach with technical ideas, solutions solve the critical problems in the field of character, face, symbol recognition procedure, and estimating the density ratio. Recognition of single text, numbers is easy than the recognition of mixed connective conjunct consonants. Because of their variations, various handwritten pen-stroke pulses, tuning the initial and end position of each conjunct consonant, some consonants are connected and mixed with their left-cum right-side placed conjuncts, numerals, and symbols. Many languages such as Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, Telugu, and Tamil represent syllabic, symbol scripted form, and most of words formed with the mixed conjuncts, mixed cum touched consonants, mixed conjuncts with numerals in their representation. This research approach has proposed the five-layered neural fuzzy closed-loop hybrid system with compound Bayesian decision-making process holding good outcome for classification cum identification of mixed connective conjunct consonants with their numerals. The recognition process can start with categorizing total text into two forms; normal conjunct consonants and mixed connective conjunct consonants. The permutation futures of five-layered neural fuzzy closed-loop hybrid system represent inputs as neurons, convert it into fuzzy set inputs, and then apply the fuzzification process with desirable fuzzy knowledge based rules to produce the required output through responses.

It aims at assigning a suitable developer for the reported bug. The assigned developer edits the source code in order to resolve the bug. Existing bug assignment techniques use different bug report parameters for selection of suitable developer. In the literature, bug report parameters are always weighed equally for developer selection. However, each parameter has varying importance among themselves. Thus, it would be beneficial to assign varying weights to the bug report parameters. This paper presents a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based bug assignment technique, W8Prioritizer, that prioritizes bug report parameters on the basis of their relative importance before making the developer assignment. The experimental results show an improved accuracy for the AHP based bug assignment approach. The proposed approach achieves 70.59% and 86.15% accuracy in Mozilla and Eclipse projects respectively for top-10 list size in comparison to accuracy of 50% and 47.58% for baseline term frequency approach. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.","AHP; Bug report assignment; Bug triaging; Developer ranking; MCDM","Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Assignment technique; Bug reports; Bug triaging; Developer ranking; MCDM; Multi-criteria decision making technique; Term Frequency; Program debugging","Goyal, A.; Department of CSE, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-62, India; email: anjaligoyal19@yahoo.in",,"IOS Press",18724981,,,,"English","Intelligent Decis.

These networks may have with largely different characteristics in terms of multiple attributes. Hence, it becomes difficult for CR vehicular node to select preferred network for spectrum handoff decision. This can be done by a context aware spectrum handoff that takes multiple attributes into account for spectrum handoff decision for preferred network selection. This paper proposes a context aware spectrum handoff scheme with multiple attributes decision-making (MADM) methods for preferred network selection in CR vehicular networks. The MADM methods used are simple additive weighting and grey relational analysis. The paper also proposes a cost-based spectrum handoff scheme with MADM which outperforms other MADM methods. The spectrum handoff with MADM provides wider and optimum choice with quality of service. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is effective for spectrum handoff decision for preferred network selection.

It stores huge amount of subject-oriented, time-stamped, non-volatile and integrated data. It is highly required of the system to respond to complex online analytical queries posed against its data warehouse in seconds for efficient decision making. Optimization of online analytical query processing (OLAP) could substantially minimize delays in query response time. Materialized view is an efficient and effective OLAP query optimization technique to minimize query response time. Selecting a set of such appropriate views for materialization is referred to as view selection, which is a nontrivial task. In this regard, an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) based view selection algorithm (ABCVSA), which has been adapted by incorporating N-point and GBFS based N-point random insertion operations, to select Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice is proposed. Experimental results show that ABCVSA performs better than the most fundamental view selection algorithm HRUA. Thus, the views selected using ABCVSA on materialization would reduce the query response time of OLAP queries and thereby aid analysts in arriving at strategic business decisions in an effective manner.

Subsequently, fuzzy TOPSIS is used to prioritize the decision criteria. Findings – Fuzzy TOPSIS multiple criteria decision-making technique is explained and applied to determine relative importance of the several decision criteria of FMS. This will help management of organizations in taking decision for implementing FMS in their organizations. From this study, it is found that customer satisfaction is the top most criterion among several other criteria for the successful implementation of FMS. Research limitations/implications – In situation like the one considered in this research, there are dependencies and interactions among the criteria and, therefore, other techniques such as fuzzy analytic network process would have been a better choice. Nevertheless, fuzzy TOPSIS also provides good result as it incorporates vagueness associated with the decision maker’s opinion pertaining to the several FMS decision criteria.

The real world is marred with various turmoils and people hold myriad variety of views and judgments regarding various issues. Their opinions are often poorly backed by facts. We refer to such inconclusive judgements that users generate and propagate on OSM platforms as Multi-Opinionated Content. One of the greatest challenge in such an environment is to analyze and classify such content into multiple opinion classes. In this work, we propose a generic semi-supervised classification based methodology for analyzing and classifying multi-opinionated content. We have used widely known off-the-shelf classifiers namely KNN, decision tree and random forest in our approach. To implement and validate our methodology, we have mined opinions on content in various forms, namely videos, tweets and posts on three popular social media platforms namely Youtube, Twitter and Facebook, respectively. In our validation, we have taken the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan as our case study. We have used plethora of features in building the classification model. Our experiments show that Random Forest classifier gives maximum accuracy of 90.02% and user level features give the best results.

The goal of this work was to compare the performance of different classifiers tested on spatio-temporal features used to distinguish between true and distorted handwriting behaviour to detect deception using machine learning experiments. Dynamic handwriting features depict a writer’s individuality and neuro-psychic condition. Handwritten features share inter-class characteristics while a few of them are very unique to an individual writer. However, extraction of discriminating features & selecting them in decision making process with respect to an individual is really crucial and complex thing, which helps the construction of any classifier, aiming to build the decision support system. Spatio-temporal attributes carry significant discriminatory information in deception detection. In this work, a set of total twelve features (spatial and temporal with pressure measures) features were used from online handwritten data. Five different classifiers (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) were tested on these feature set with three separate factual descriptions: Person, Action & Event, in both true and distorted mode to develop a decision support system based on the outcome of the experiment on handwriting behaviour.

Cluster formation and cluster head selection in MANET is an important issue in such networks. Clustering is one of the vital issues used in increasing the network life time by gathering the information from specific group of nodes and forwarding it to other neighbouring cluster heads. This paper propose a soft computing based approach for the selection of the cluster head in MANET. A cluster head selection model based on fuzzy logic has been devised. Cluster head selection is done on the basis of three parameters viz., residual energy, centrality and hop-count. Materials and Methods: The proposed approach has been implemented in MATLAB followed by execution of cluster-head selection based on fuzzy logic using 3 criteria viz; residual energy, hop count and centrality. Results: The benefits of this approach include reduced overhead, improved performance of cluster node selection and increased network lifetime. Conclusion: Through simulation, it has been observed that this approach outperforms over existing approaches. The model has also been analytically validated. The new important aspects can be integrating mobility and trust to the existing model as fourth parameter for cluster-head selection that helps in improving the network performance. © 2017 Jay Prakash et al.","Centrality; Cluster head; Fuzzy logic; Hop-count; Mobile ad-hoc network; Residual energy",,"Prakash, J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of TechnologyIndia",,"Asian Network for Scientific Information",19945450,,,,"English","J.

Businesses are also keen to discover those rules which can generate more profits. These profitable purchase patterns of customers once identified can lead to better product assortment decision making for businesses. Better Product Assortment decisions can surely be a competitive advantage for businesses in terms of customer satisfaction and profit generation. The concepts of support and confidence in the association rules help to extract the rules with frequent and reliable co-occurrences of the items in customers' purchases. The profitable rules can be assessed using the domain-related measures such as item set value and the cross-selling profit associated with the association rules. We propose a ranking mechanism to combine the different criteria of Confidence, Support, Item Set Value and Cross-Selling Profit to get an overall interestingness measure; using Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) approach; which in turn uses DIVIZ as the implementation tool.

The amount of reactive power to be injected is trivial for different types and sizes of the power system. To control voltage instability, reactive power in a power system needs to be boosted. Proposed controller output decides amount of reactive power which perturbs the system equation to the stable operating point. The proposed Perturb-Boost Fuzzy Logic Controller differs from conventional controllers due to its single shot boost action, which perturbs system dynamics in such a way as to push it to safe zones of voltage stability. This paper analyzes the performance of the proposed controller to control the voltage instability for the generalized three node power system benchmark model. Reactive power to be injected is momentary due to single shot boost action. Time to reach instability gets delayed by approximately fifteen seconds using proposed controller for the benchmark model. Mitigation of voltage collapse is discussed in view of simulation results using proposed novel controller. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

WSNs comprises of sensor nodes having limited energy as battery powers them. These batteries cannot be changed or recharged as they are operated in a harsh environment. Energy conservation mechanism should be developed. Through study, it is found that clustering is an approach for achieving energy efficiency. In this type of protocols, cluster heads (CH) are chosen among the sensor nodes and then clusters are formed by assigning non-cluster head to the nearest cluster head. Load balancing and the distribution of the cluster heads are the major drawbacks. To deal with the mentioned difficulties, a double optimization based on fuzzy logic approach and harmony search algorithm is proposed in this paper known as fuzzy logic and improved harmony search based clustering (FLIHSBC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm not only balances the energy consumption but also helps in maximizing the network lifetime.

Fuzzy set (FS) is one of them. The next one is intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS). Further generalization is interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS). But all those models had some difficulty due to lack of parameterization tool, which motivated mathematician Molodtsov to introduce soft set model in 1999. Hybrid models of these models are more efficient. Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IVIFSS) introduced by Jiyang. Following their characteristic function approach Tripathy et al. introduced fuzzy soft set as a hybrid model in 2015. Here, we continue this further to define IVI fuzzy soft sets (IVIFSS). Many related concepts like complement, null, and absolute IVIFSS are introduced and operations like intersection and union of IVIFSSs are also redefined. Recently, soft set is applied in various forms to derive decision-making (DM) by Tripathy et al. We extend it further by proposing an algorithm which uses IVIFSS in order to achieve DM. These algorithms are much improved and applicable than that of Jiyang. Also, it generalizes all the previous algorithms in this direction. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Decision-making; Interval-valued fuzzy set; IVIFSS; Soft sets","Decision making; Set theory; Characteristic functions; Interval-valued; Interval-valued fuzzy sets; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; IVIFSS; Soft sets; Uncertainty problems; Fuzzy sets","Mohanty, R.K.; SCSE, VIT UniversityIndia; email: rknmohanty@gmail.com","Bhateja V.Joshi A.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811016745,,,"English","Adv.

The association between the identified factors is established by employing an interpretive structural modeling methodology that is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. Later, the MICMAC analysis is carried out for identifying the factors having high influential power. The results of the study revealed that a CSF namely ‘previous technological experience’ is the most significant factor having the highest driving power.

The threat model for such systems should address both internal and external attackers.

While some analyses have focussed on cryptography to provide a solution, a comprehensive and workable solution for, say, illegal profiling, is still lacking, and there are also many problems from a systems perspective that need to be addressed such as access control models to constrain the access to sensitive data as well as integrity of its metadata.

In the conventional dual SBM model, the data and the weights of input and output are found as crisp quantities. However, in real world applications, input-output data and input-output weights may have vague/uncertainty due to various factors such as quality of treatment and medicines, number of medical and non-medical staffs, number of patients, etc. in health sector. To deal with such uncertainty, we can apply fuzzy set theory. In this paper, we propose a SBM model with fuzzy weights in Fuzzy DEA (FDEA) for fuzzy input and fuzzy output. This model is then reduced to a crisp LPP by using expected values of a fuzzy number (FN). Finally, we present an application of the proposed model to the health sector, consisting of two input variables as (i) sum of number of doctors and staff nurses (ii) number of pharmacists and two output variables as (i) number of inpatients (ii) number of outpatients. Both the input variables and output variables are considered as TFNs. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Fuzzy DEA; Fuzzy dual SBM; Fuzzy weights; Hospitals efficiencies","Computation theory; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Fuzzy sets; Health; Patient treatment; Problem solving; Soft computing; Decision making unit; Fuzzy DEA; Fuzzy dual SBM; Fuzzy weight; Input and outputs; Input-output data; Performance efficiency; Slack-based measures; Fuzzy set theory","Arya, A.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology RoorkeeIndia; email: alka1dma@gmail.com","Bansal J.C.Pant M.Das K.N.Nagar A.K.Garg H.Deep K.Lal A.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811033216,,,"English","Adv.

Task analysis substantially optimizes task performance by addressing human error during system design. Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rule (GOMS) is widely used technique of task analysis to enhance usability, human performance and overall productivity of the system. Although widely used, a major constraint of GOMS is its inability to support designers to envisage the outcome of decision making for method selection while performing different operations to achieve the goal. This drawback of GOMS hinders efficiency of task analysis and thereby affects designers in optimizing design interventions for end users. The present study was conducted to address the issue of Decision making in GOMS. An integrated framework consisting of payoff matrix in GOMS has been proposed and validated. To evaluate the usability of proposed framework, five user experience experts were asked to evaluate two popular e commerce websites. The payoff matrix was evaluated using Laplace criterion of decision making under uncertainty rule of operation research strategy. The empirical evidence from the study indicated that selection rules for a method using human factors affects design decisions.

These news channels try to convey the news in such a way that attracts more user interaction in the form of views, likes, comments, and shares. In online news, one of the important factors in getting higher user interaction is to recommend the top news articles that would attract more number of users to give opinion, especially in the form of comments. When a news article starts getting many comments, it automatically attracts other readers to participate in the discussion. We say that a news article has “high-arousal” content if it can attract more number of comments from users. When a new news article is written it has no user interaction information, such as number of views, likes, shares or comments. In this paper, our aim is to predict news articles which have higher potential to generate high-arousal. In other words, they would attract a large number of users to give opinion in the form of comments. Unlike previous studies, we predict the arousal of news articles prior to their release, which brings the possibility of appropriate decision making to modify the article content or its ranking in audience newsfeed. We generate multiple features from the content of news articles and show that our best set of features can predict the arousal with an accuracy of 81%.

Towards this, philosophy and variants of probability theories and their theorized connections with rough memberships functions are critically analyzed. The concept of rough membership functions and rough dependence are also generalized to granular operator spaces, characterized and used for the same purpose in more general contexts. A new theory of dependence based deviant probability is developed as a severe extension of the axiomatic approach to a dependence-based probability introduced recently by the present author. This permits clearer comparison of the concept with those of rough dependence. It is shown that the theories are very distinct semantically and similarities are poorly justified. These are relevant for rethinking the various probabilistic rough theories and related methodologies. The problem of contamination reduction was proposed recently across many papers by the present author. In this study, the scope of the problem within rough membership functions, probabilistic rough sets (PSTs) and three-way decision-making is also clarified by her. A new definition of artificial intelligence applicable in rough perspectives is also proposed on the basis of recent advances in algebraic semantics related to rough membership functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Axiomatic granules; Contamination problem; Dependence; Deviant probability; Epistemological probability; Frequentism; Granular operator spaces; Probability; Rough membership functions; Rough objects","Decision making; Probability; Rough set theory; Semantics; Axiomatic granules; Contamination problem; Dependence; Epistemological probabilities; Frequentism; Granular operator spaces; Rough membership functions; Rough objects; Membership functions","Mani, A.; Department of Pure Mathematics, University of CalcuttaIndia; email: a.mani.cms@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1206212X,,IJCAF,,"English","Int J Comput Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027262323

Target coverage problem pertains to maximize the network lifetime while considering the resource scarcity. The paper proposes a hybrid scheduling protocol for target coverage for wireless sensor networks which determines the number of set covers for monitoring all the targets using the probabilistic coverage model, node contribution and trust values. The optimal observation probability is obtained for the parameter values of the sensing and communication characteristics of the nodes using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and probabilistic coverage model. The proposed protocol uses a node scheduling technique using Fuzzy Logic to activate the nodes to form the set covers. The proposed protocol is validated for a smaller network and is simulated for a real large network. The simulation results show that the performance of proposed protocol improves the network efficiency in terms of coverage, network lifetime and reliability in terms of trust factor. The comparison results show that the proposed protocol improves the performance in terms of the number of set covers, network lifetime and number of active nodes compared to disjoint set cover protocol. The simulation results show that the network lifetime and performance under constant performance is improved up to 200%.","AHP; Energy efficiency; Network lifetime; Target coverage; Trust","Analytic hierarchy process; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Hierarchical systems; Internet protocols; Quality of service; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Network lifetime; Optimal observation; Probabilistic coverage; Target coverage; Target coverage problems; Tracking application; Trust; Wireless sensor networks",,,"International Association of Engineers",1819656X,,,,"English","IAENG Int.

The primary motivation is to impart sufficient knowledge at all levels starting from educators, working professionals and decision making officials to empower them reach their individual potential. This would help these workforces to be self-sufficient without looking forward to other countries, especially during national crisis. The main challenge to the international effort in capacity building to reduce gaps between the developing and developed countries is the large variability in teaching methodologies and medium of instruction. International training programs undertaken at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, India have participants from different regions, thus challenging the trainers to manage multi-cultural and multi-ethnic learning environment. Participants come from different higher education systems each with diverse missions, history, and societal context. How to bridge the differences in culturally dependent learning and teaching styles related to cultural identity and heritage in a time bound training. An effort has been made to develop an approach through a customized survey questionnaire, which brings out pertinent highlights of analysis and review based on feedback through a customised survey conducted from the participants of International courses and training programmes organised at Dehradoon in Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS). The survey questionnaire is divided into broad vertical-themes covering major aspects related to Education, Academic, benefit from the course, amenities-infrastructure, etc. The most important and pivotal part in sample collection is the human-touch given to felicitate participants so that unbiased and open views are received, which includes translating questionnaire to language of participants in case of customised courses for specific countries and then retranslating back in English for deciphering the feedback.

Consequently, there can exist large numbers of possible query plans for a distributed query. This number increases with increase in the number of sites containing the replicated data. For large numbers of sites, computing an efficient query processing plan becomes a computationally expensive task. This necessitates the devising of a distributed query processing strategy capable of generating good quality query plans, from amongst all possible query plans, which minimize the total cost of processing a distributed query. This distributed query plan generation (DQPG) problem, being a combinatorial optimization problem, has been addressed in this paper using the modified cuckoo search algorithm. Accordingly, a modified CSA (mCSA) based DQPG algorithm (DQPGmCSA), which aims to generate good quality Top-K query plans for a given distributed query, has been proposed herein. Experimental based comparison of DQPGmCSA with the existing GA based DQPG algorithm (DQPGGA) shows that the former is able to generate comparatively better quality Top-K query plans, which, in turn, would result in a reduction in the query response time and thereby enabling efficient decision making. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA); Distributed query plan generation (DQPG); Distributed query processing; Swarm intelligence","Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Genetic algorithms; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Query languages; Query processing; Soft computing; Swarm intelligence; Combinatorial optimization problems; Cuckoo search algorithms; Distributed database; Distributed query; Distributed query processing; Plan generation; Query response time; Replicated data; Problem solving","Vijay Kumar, T.V.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: tvvijaykumar@hotmail.com","Bansal J.C.Pant M.Das K.N.Nagar A.K.Garg H.Deep K.Lal A.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811033216,,,"English","Adv.

The emission of CO2 from the fossil fuel power plants is the key pollutant that is causing a major threat to the environment. So the conventional power plants are required to incorporate with carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, and this increases the capital cost of the power plants. Hence it becomes a big decision for the investors in the electricity generation sector to make either to invest in construction of fossil fuel-fired plants with CCS or in the units that are free from pollutants such as nuclear and renewable energy systems. This decision making can be mathematically expressed all the way through generation expansion planning (GEP) problem. Due to its large-scale, long-term, non-linear, and discrete nature of generation unit size, GEP becomes a very challenging task. To improve the power system reliability with efficient economic operation, Energy storage systems (ESSs) has been a very effective means of obtaining this objective, whereby based on technology employed the energy is stored in a certain form and is transformed to electrical energy when desired. The day by day increase in the use of renewable energy sources to generate electrical energy poses both expansion and operational challenges. This paper presents an insight review of various aspects related to the expansion of the electrical power system such as GEP and renewable energy technologies (RETs) to maintain supply demand balance besides satisfying reliability criteria as well and various optimization techniques adopted to obtain the solution of the objective function. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy storage systems (ESSs); Generation Expansion Planning (GEP); Reliability; Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs)","Carbon capture; Decision making; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Expansion; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Pollution; Reliability; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Conventional power plants; Electricity generation sectors; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Generation expansion planning; Power system reliability; Renewable energy technologies; Use of renewable energies; Renewable energy resources",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Recent progress in combining Reinforcement Learning objective functions and Deep Learning architectures has achieved promising results for such tasks. An important aspect of such sequential decision making problems, which has largely been neglected, is for the agent to decide on the duration of time for which to commit to actions. Such action repetition is important for computational efficiency, which is necessary for the agent to respond in real-time to events (in applications such as self-driving cars). Action Repetition arises naturally in real life as well as simulated environments. The time scale of executing an action enables an agent (both humans and AI) to decide the granularity of control during task execution. Current state of the art Deep Reinforcement Learning models, whether they are off-policy (Mnih et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015) or on-policy (Mnih et al. 2016), consist of a framework with a static action repetition paradigm, wherein the action decided by the agent is repeated for a fixed number of time steps regardless of the contextual state while executing the task. In this paper, we propose a new framework-Dynamic Action Repetition which changes Action Repetition Rate (the time scale of repeating an action) from a hyper-parameter of an algorithm to a dynamically learnable quantity. At every decision-making step, our models allow the agent to commit to an action and the time scale of executing the action. We show empirically that such a dynamic time scale mechanism improves the performance on relatively harder games in the Atari 2600 domain, independent of the underlying Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm used. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

How can design thinking visualize the contradictory and controversial nature of matters of concern, where perspectives and stakes are unequal, contesting and conflicting, but with inter dependencies, not all of which are entirely predictable? Prompted by advancing technology and increasing complexity of the design inquiry, role of the user in negotiating such contestations has lately been in flux. Increasingly, the user is perceived not as a mere consumer driven by immediate self-serving gains, but as an inter-dependent actor negotiating for an empowering and equitable solution for all. This necessitates the exploration of how blurring of strict boundaries between user, designer, and a social agent is diluting dichotomies between user/designer, social-worker/capitalist, consumer/producer, use/profit, or need/desire. Hence, this paper is an epistemic inquiry into the trajectory of user participation in responsible decision-making through the analysis of six design frameworks holding different kinds and extents of social accountability. Thereby seeking, twofold objectives: (a) to establish the theoretical antecedents of user participation in design for social responsibility, and (b) to assess the future of responsible design decisions in discourse and practice. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Collaboration in design; Empowered user; Future of responsible design; Social responsibility; User driven","Decision making; Social aspects; Advancing technology; Collaboration in designs; Collaborative design; Empowered user; Inter-dependencies; Social responsibilities; User driven; User participation; User centered design","Sharma, S.; IITIndia; email: shanush@iitk.ac.in","Chakrabarti A.Chakrabarti D.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",21903018,9789811035173,,,"English",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014492886

Therefore, this work focuses on using fuzzy logic to accommodate diversity and uncertainty in user choices and interest. This would help in generating better recommendations with different tastes that correspond to different interest choices of the user. In this paper, a fuzzy hybrid multi-agent recommender system is designed and developed. The novelty of our approach is the use of interval type-2 fuzzy sets to create user models capable of capturing the inherent ambiguity of human behavior related to diverse users' tastes. In the due course, we also extended an existing, well known hybrid recommendation method, by integrating the proposed fuzzy approach into the recommendation process. As a result, a new RS approach was developed, which was capable of improving the prediction accuracy of system and at the same time reducing errors by being able to extract more information from the available dataset. Experimental study and analysis was conducted using two case studies namely book purchase and shopping women apparels. As a result, the proposed recommendation approach was found to perform considerably well as compared to its counterparts, even under data sparsity conditions. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Remote sensing and Geo-ICT tools offer a simple, fast, efficient and cost-effective method of not just updating the horticulture crop inventory but also integrating the database, thus making it conducive for easy retrieval, analysis and decision-making. Medium and high resolution remote sensing data like LISS-IV and PAN prove to be effective in inventorying crops like mango, citrus and oil palm. Object oriented techniques work best in identifying and mapping fruit orchards as against per pixel classifiers, which are more useful for field crops. This is because the information needed for image analysis and classification is represented in meaningful image objects and their mutual relations. This study aims at mapping multiple crops, viz. mango and oil palm in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. Multi-resolution segmentation has been done after assigning scale parameter and weightages to various parameters like shape, compactness, color, smoothness and NDVI. Subsequently, the potential mango and oil palm areas have been delineated based on texture and shape/geometry information obtained from high resolution PAN data. Field validation of the crop map indicated 89% agreement with field data. Hence multiple high resolution datasets have the potential to map the spatial distribution of mango and oil palm plantations at district and subdistrict level. Object oriented classification techniques use the form, texture and spectral information in a sequential manner to delineate multiple horticulture crops. © Corrosion and Prevention 2017.

The leagile supply chain management paradigm includes lean and agile principles and has attained greater importance in the current scenario. The objective of this work is to identify the most appropriate leagile enablers for implementation by companies based on the characteristics of the related market by linking competitive bases, leagile attributes and leagile enablers. In this paper, a quality function deployment (QFD) approach integrated with analytical hierarchy process and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is proposed to enhance the leagility of the supply chain. Fuzzy logic is used to deal with linguistic judgments expressing relationships and the correlations required by QFD. The presentation of a case study from the Indian food processing industry illustrates the proposed methodology. This approach will help the management to exploit the most influential enablers in achieving the desired degree of leagility. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","AHP; Decision support; Fuzzy logic; Leagile supply chain; Quality function deployment; Supply chain management; TOPSIS","Commerce; Computer circuits; Decision support systems; Food processing; Fuzzy logic; Quality function deployment; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Decision supports; Food processing industry; Global competition; Leagile supply chain; Quality function deployments (QFD); Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions; TOPSIS; Supply chain management","Boddu, V.; Department of Production Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: varma0609@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09565515,,JIMNE,,"English","J Intell Manuf",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008516498

A human perception-based framework is used for the calculation of agility. The case study was carried out in a North India-based manufacturing organization. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the concept of a multi-grade fuzzy logic approach is used. Using this concept, the overall agility index has been determined. The fuzzy logic approach has been used to overcome the disadvantages such as impreciseness and vagueness using a scoring method. Findings - From the analysis, it is observed that the organization on which the study was performed is ""very agile."" After evaluating the agility level, the fuzzy performance importance index is calculated, which helps to identify the barriers of agility in the supply chain. These barriers help decision makers to implement appropriate improvement measures for improving agility level. Overall, 11 barriers were identified in the study. Research limitations/implications - Managers of the contemporary manufacturing organization have to measure the agility level of the organization and identify barriers to agility in order to survive in a competitive environment. The obstacles identified in this study are used to improve the performance of the organization. The enterprise should improve on the weak areas in order to achieve the highest agility level. Originality/value - The agile supply chain (ASC) enablers proposed by previous researchers are not sufficient for the evaluation of agility of a supply chain. There are a few more ASC enablers such as customer satisfaction, flexibility and adaptability that also play a vital role in making a supply chain agile. Adding these three ASC enablers, a total of seven ASC enablers along with their attributes are being considered for the development of a conceptual model. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptability; Agile manufacturing; Agile supply chain; Case studies; Customer satisfaction; Flexibility","Computer circuits; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Industrial research; Manufacture; Adaptability; Agile manufacturing; Agile supply chains; Case-studies; Flexibility; Supply chains","Patel, B.S.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu UniversityIndia; email: bharat.s.aero@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1741038X,,,,"English","J.

They have highly improved in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions and by the sheer volume of collected images, the necessity of simplification of automation in feature extraction. Road data play a key role in urban planning, traffic management, military applications, and vehicle navigation as well as for decision making in numerous applications. The faster updation of road infrastructure is a need because the technology has brought map in the hands of people in the form of mobile phones and tablets. Road detection is one of the major issues of the road infrastructure extraction. Its accuracy depends on the type of methodology used. An attempt is made here to analyse the first order, the co-occurrence texture features and image transforms useful for discriminating roads from other features specially the buildings. The identified dataset forms high dimension feature space and the Support Vector Machine is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of high dimensional datasets. In the past, SVMs have been tested and evaluated only as pixel-based image classifiers. Moving from pixel-based techniques towards object-based representation, the dimensions of remote sensing imagery feature space increases significantly. An SVM approach for classification was followed, based on primitive image objects produces by a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The SVM procedure produced the final object classification results which were compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier results and were found to give better results in OBIA domain. © 2017 ACRS.

Ad hoc nature, limited energy, and limited network lifetime are the major reasons that expose WSN’s to many security attacks. Intrusion detection is the most important method to intercept all these attacks. In this paper, we propose a new method called Priority Dissection Supervision (PDS) for intrusion detection in WSN. The proposed PDS uses fuzzy logic for prioritizing the impact of distributed intrusion over line of control (LOC). Proposed PDS is a coherent system which models the key elements sensor deployment, intrusion detection, tracking, and priority list. PDS makes use of weight and impact factors which detects the influence field of different types of intruders and accordingly calculates the amount of deterioration. By the use of PDS system the operational and deployment cost can be decreased significantly. Simulation results on MATLAB exhibit the potency and precision of the proposed PDS. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Fuzzy; Intrusion detection; LOC; Priority; WSN","Fuzzy logic; Intrusion detection; MATLAB; Mercury (metal); Deployment costs; Fuzzy; Limited energies; Line of controls; Network lifetime; Priority; Security attacks; Sensor deployment; Wireless sensor networks","Gupta, A.; Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology, Sector-17, India; email: guptaayushi260894@gmail.com","Bhateja V.Satapathy S.C.Joshi A.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811016776,,,"English","Adv.

Providing security and tamper resistant hardware to each node is also unrealistic. The compromised nodes can populate network with forged false reports which can cause false alarms and wrong decision making in networks. En-Route filtering is a popular method for filtering false reports in WSNs. Many such filtering techniques have been proposed for filtering false reports based on single sink. In this paper we propose a multi-sink en-route filtering mechanism, which reduces the overall energy consumption of the network. This is achieved by dividing the network into smaller networks and assigning a separate sink to each smaller network. This helps in reducing the hop count of genuine reports, saving lot of energy consumption. The proposed technique also decreases the key-exchange overhead maintaining the same filtering efficiency. The proposed technique also reduces the effect of selective forwarding attack in the network. The simulated results also support our claims and we are able to save up to 40% of energy consumption. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,"Decision making; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; En-route filtering; Filtering efficiency; Filtering technique; Selective forwarding attacks; Simulated results; Tamper resistant; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security","Kumar, A.; Information Security Research Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: alok_21@outlook.com","Martinez Perez G.Gomez Marmol F.Thampi S.M.Westphall C.B.Fan C.I.Hu J.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811068973,,,"English","Commun.

The main sources of noise are coming from human malpractices on reckless car driving and the use of loud speakers in different festivals at different places. Behavioural study explores that in many places the local usual road traffic noise level exceeds the normal standards. However, few people have adaptive capacity to ignore the effect of ambient noise pollution within considerable limits. Thus, in this article, we have developed an adaptive traffic noise model over the vulnerable society of a specific noise-prone zone. We develop a fuzzy logic to analyse the noise risk, and then it has been compared by the odds ratio of the experimental data. Moreover, we have considered the normality and non-normality in participation for various noise parameters, namely noise level, exposure time and affected age group of the people of a particular place as well.

Shunt flexible AC transmission system devices like static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) may be harnessed to provide voltage support by dynamic injection of reactive power.In this work, the STATCOM provided voltage compensation at the point of common coupling in five test cases, namely, simultaneous occurrence of step change (drop) in wind speed and dip in grid voltage, single line to ground, line to line, double line to ground faults and sudden increment in load by more than a thousand times. Three techniques were employed to control the STATCOM, namely, fuzzy logic, particle swarm optimization and a combination of both. A performance comparison was made among the three soft computing techniques used to control the STATCOM on the basis of the amount of voltage compensation offered at the point of common coupling. The simulations were done with the help of SimPowerSystems available with MATLAB / SIMULINK and the results validated that the STATCOM controlled by all the three techniques offered voltage compensation in all the cases considered.

To overcome this imbalance, a reliable, efficient, less centralised, and more interactive energy management system (EMS) has to be realized. One of the methods to bridge the supply–demand gap using EMS is through Load Management. The evolution of EMS allows loads to respond to the demand (Demand Response) and assist customers to make informed decisions about their energy consumption, adjusting both the timing and quantity of their electricity use. This paper deals with the development of Fuzzy logic-based load management scheme using Demand Response Programs in smart microgrids.

In practical applications, computational techniques have given best results and the research in this field is continuously growing. The purpose of this paper is to search for a general and effective intelligent tool for prediction of patient survival after surgery. The present study involves the construction of such intelligent computational models using different configurations, including data partitioning techniques that have been experimentally evaluated by applying them over realistic medical data set for the prediction of survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of the experiments and research performed over the data belonging to various fields using different intelligent tools, the authors infer that combining or integrating the qualification aspects of fuzzy inference system and quantification aspects of artificial neural network can prove an efficient and better model for prediction. The authors have constructed three soft computing-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models with different configurations and data partitioning techniques with an aim to search capable predictive tools that could deal with nonlinear and complex data. After evaluating the models over three shuffles of data (training set, test set and full set), the performances were compared in order to find the best design for prediction of patient survival after surgery. The construction and implementation of models have been performed using MATLAB simulator. Findings: On applying the hybrid intelligent neuro-fuzzy models with different configurations, the authors were able to find its advantage in predicting the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. Experimental results and comparison between the constructed models conclude that ANFIS with Fuzzy C-means (FCM) partitioning model provides better accuracy in predicting the class with lowest mean square error (MSE) value. Apart from MSE value, other evaluation measure values for FCM partitioning prove to be better than the rest of the models. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the model can be applied to other biomedicine and engineering fields dealing with different complex issues related to imprecision and uncertainty. Originality/value: The originality of paper includes framework showing two-way flow for fuzzy system construction which is further used by the authors in designing the three simulation models with different configurations, including the partitioning methods for prediction of patient survival after surgery. Several experiments were carried out using different shuffles of data to validate the parameters of the model. The performances of the models were compared using various evaluation measures such as MSE. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Artificial neural network (ANN); Fuzzy inference system (FIS); Fuzzy logic; Soft computing","Artificial intelligence; C (programming language); Complex networks; Computation theory; Data handling; Diseases; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; MATLAB; Mean square error; Neural networks; Search engines; Soft computing; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Tracking (position); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Computational technique; Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy inference systems; Intelligent computational model; Nonlinear fuzzy systems; Partitioning methods; Structure identification; Fuzzy inference","Khan, S.S.; Department of Computer Science, University of KashmirIndia; email: shabiakhan@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1756378X,,,,"English","Int.

The major factor behind the energy consumption inWSN is its data collectionmechanism.The direct data transmission fromeach sensor node to the Base Station (BS) consumes more energy than other alternatives. Also it is unnecessary, due to redundant data transmission because of geographically closer nodes. Clustering is the best data collection architectural model for WSN since it takes care of in-network processing which handles redundant data within the network.The techniques used for the network having uniform node distribution are not suitable for the networks which have nonuniformly distributed nodes. This paper contributes a novel clustering algorithm: Fuzzy Logic Based Energy Efficient Clustering Hierarchy (FLECH) for nonuniformWSN. The clusters in FLECH are created using proper parameters which increases the lifetime of the WSN. Fuzzy logic in FLECH is wisely used to combine important parameters like residual energy, node centrality, and distance to BS for electing best suitable nodes as CH and increases the network lifetime. FLECH performance is verified in different scenarios and the results are compared with LEACH, CHEF, ECPF, EAUCF, and MOFCA.The simulation results clearly indicate the lifetime increase by FLECH over other algorithms and its energy conservation per round of data collection in the network. © 2017 Baranidharan Balakrishnan and Santhi Balachandran.",,"Clustering algorithms; Computer circuits; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Architectural modeling; Data collection; Distributed nodes; Energy Efficient clustering; In-network processing; Network lifetime; Node distribution; Real-time application; Wireless sensor networks","Balakrishnan, B.; School of Computing, SASTRA UniversityIndia; email: baranier85@gmail.com",,"Hindawi Limited",15308669,,,,"English","Wireless Commun.

A pattern is temporally similar when it satisfies subset constraints. The naive and apriori algorithm designed for non-temporal databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns from temporal databases. The brute force approach requires computing 2ntrue support combinations for ‘n’ items from finite item set and falls in NP-class. The apriori or fp-tree based approaches are not directly extendable to temporal databases to obtain similar temporal patterns.

This invention implemented by Electromyography (EMG) sensor to recognize different intramuscular signals for precise recognition of the subjects. In this regards, the Finger and Wrist position with different muscles activity signals are captured by EMG sensor by Fuzzy Logic to develop Matrix model to represent spinal segment and palm muscle activity. This novel approach would provide improvement in the research work for the inarticulate people to design interpreter for less communication system. Method: The proposed system detects the muscle signal pattern of a particular hand gestures using Electromyography (EMG) signal to developed sign language recognition system and analyzed with Fuzzy Logic. The gesture recognition systems work as following - gesture signal acquisition, processing of acquired gesture signal, descriptor extraction, and finally classification of descriptor to one of the probable gestures. Results: In order to recognize some simple sign language implement artificial neural network along with fuzzy detection technique. The different EMG signals are analyzed and recognized by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and fuzzy detection is involved to obtain more accurate recognition. We consider the uncertainties involved at various stages to have the perfect recognition system i.e., defining image regions, finding features, establishing relations among them, and matching, so that it retains as much as possible information of the original input image for making a conclusion at the highest level. The main objective of this area is to reveal the technical aspects in recognition of particular sign language. The neural network is a strong enough tool to detect the sign expression according to our hand and finger movements. As per our requirement we implement the Neu-roph Studio tool, and then a matrix can be arranged with the appropriate data. Conclusion: This paper proposed a novel approach towards hand gesture recognition implementing data obtained from EMG sensors with promising recognition performance and high reliability.

In addition rapid and unplanned urban expansion increase the social, physical and environmental problems in an area. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify and manage urban growth for sustainable development of city. This study intends to assess the effectiveness of landscape metrics in quantifying the urbanization-induced land use/land cover changes for Kota city of Rajasthan state. Based on satellite images derived land use/land cover data, landscape metrics were calculated to characterize long-term trends and patterns of urbanization during 1989-2016. Changes of landscape pattern during the study period were analyzed by different landscape metrics viz. shannon's entropy, Edge Density (ED), Number of Patches (NP), Largest Patch Index (LPI), patch cohesion index, clumpiness, Landscape Shape Index (LSI) and fractal dimension index. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the land use/cover changes reveals significant increase in built-up land. NP results explains that there was increase in number of patches for built-up and cropland class during 1989 to 2011, this signifies the patched/fragmented growth in city. However, in 2016, the NP decreases which indicates that there was coalescence of grown patches to a single patch. ED and LPI results reveal increasing trend for built up area during the study period. Agricultural land at the urban fringe is converted into residential and industrial areas, which has been supported by decrease in NP and ED of cropland and fallow land. Results reflects that city was more compact in 1989 and began to expand in all directions, especially in the north-east and northwest region of the city. This study will help the decision makers to understand and the landscape dynamics and linking the agents of change for better planning and sustainable development of the city. © 2017 ACRS.

A structured linguistic variable has been taken as an illustrative example to show its validity and superiority than the existing measures. Furthermore, based on this measure, an approach to deal with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem is developed. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the decision making process. A computed result is compared with the help of existing results.

Detection of targets is an essential requirement in numerous defence and civilian applications. Though primarily, the problem of target detection can be defined as a binary hypothesis testing problem which confirms the presence or absence of targets of interest, however, detection of a target itself may not be sufficient in decision making. Therefore, its classification and identification is also the key. Detection and identification of target using remote sensing data is a challenging task. Different remote sensing data such as hyperspectral (HSI), SAR, LiDAR data etc. have been used for detection of targets. Hyperspectral data, due to its high spectral information, has recently gained momentum in target detection but these may be limited to indicating presence of targets. Therefore, fusion of different datasets may be necessary. In this paper, an approach for detection and identification of two types of targets (vehicle and tree) using decision level fusion of HSI and LiDAR data has been proposed. Firstly, spectral detection using HSI data has been implemented. Next, LiDAR point cloud classification has been performed and used for computing morphological parameters for each target. Lastly the decisions obtained from HSI, LiDAR and morphological analysis have been fused to infer identity of desired targets. Results demonstrated that both types of targets have been successfully identified using the proposed approach. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

A new MLI by a level repetition system takes the method of a half-bridge inverter nearly twin the levels. The topology practises H-bridge MLI but offers a comparable presentation of an unequal topology in terms of voltage. Also, it keeps the virtue of unvarying stocking of the distinct cell for a MLI. The method is executed by linking a three-arm H-bridge (only two switches per phase) with the complete three-phase inverter to double the number of levels. Thus, it meaningfully recovers the power quality, lessens the switching frequency and lessens the cost and size of the power filter.

At unsignalized intersections, crossing drivers have to accept or reject the available gap. The gap acceptance decision is influenced by different dynamics such as traffic, geometric, environmental and human factors. The decision to cross the major road largely depends on the speed, distance and the heaviness of the potentially conflicting vehicle on the major road. The driver's gap acceptance data was collected at 4-legged unsignalized intersections. The information such as the type of crossing vehicle, conflicting vehicle, speed and the spatial gap was extracted from the video data. This paper deals with the application of three widely used non-parametric data mining techniques, namely, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RF) and Decision Trees (DT) to predict the gap acceptance behaviour of the driver. While SVMs are insensitive to class imbalance, decision tree generated by CART algorithm provides critical insights into decision making process employed by the driver. Random forests and decision tree implicitly establish the relative importance of different factors affecting the driver's decision. Further, skill scores used to validate the models revealed that SVM and DT models performed almost similarly whereas, RF model outperformed SVM and DT. © 2017 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model used a linguistic approach to extract the sentiment words from the free text. It used term frequency-inverse document frequency values to represent features of various places in bag-of-words format. Sentiment dictionary is used to calculate senti-scores. It used different MCDM techniques like simple additive weight and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods for ranking hospitals based on their aggregated senti-score. Findings: Statistical correlation analysis between the rankings of places reveals that the TOPSIS method is the most suitable ranking technique among other MCDM techniques. By improving the senti-score, one can bring their enterprise to the top position. Research limitations/implications: Data set is collected from different websites like Twitter, Facebook, etc., for various services/features. Moderate amount of reviews are collected for each place. But not all users give their views on the social media websites. It would be essential to collect responses from all the customers who avail different services at different places. Practical implications: The sentiment analysis model proposed in this paper enables B2C and C2C commerce. Business may take suitable measures to overcome their issues/problems raised by the consumer. Consumers can share and educate other consumers about their experiences. Social implications: The development of internet has strong influence in all types of industries like healthcare. The availability of internet has changed the way of accessing the information and sharing their experience with others. This paper recognizes the use and impact of social media on the healthcare industry by analyzing the users' feelings expressed in the form of free text.

Earlier prediction of the fault-prone software modules enables timely correction of the faults and delivery of reliable product. Generally, the fuzzy logic, decision tree and neural networks are deployed for fault prediction. But these techniques suffer due to low accuracy and inconsistency. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a spiral life cycle model-based Bayesian classification technique for efficient software fault prediction and classification. In this process, initially the dependent and independent software modules are identified. The spiral life cycle model is used for testing the software modules in each life cycle of the software development process. Bayesian classification is applied to classify the software modules as faulty module and non-faulty module, by using the probability distribution models. Robust similarity-aware clustering algorithm performs clustering of the faulty and non-faulty software modules based on the similarity measure of the features in the dataset. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed method enables accurate prediction and classification of the faulty modules. The proposed technique achieves higher accuracy, precision, recall, probability of detection, F-measure and lower error rate than the existing techniques. The misclassification rate of the proposed technique is found to be lower than the existing techniques. Hence, the reliability of the software development process can be improved. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bayesian classification; Robust similarity-aware clustering (RSC) algorithm; Segregate fault prediction algorithm; Software development; Spiral life cycle model; Spiral life cycle model-based Bayesian classification technique (SLMBC)","Algorithms; Clustering algorithms; Computer software; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Life cycle; Probability distributions; Software engineering; Software reliability; Software testing; Bayesian classification; Fault prediction algorithms; Life cycle model; Misclassification rates; Probability distribution model; Probability of detection; Software development process; Software fault prediction; Software design","Chinna Gounder Dhanajayan, R.; Department of Computer Science, PERI Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: cdrajaganapathy@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983406934

Network Mobility (NEMO) in CR vehicular networks is concerned with the management of this movement. In future NEMO based CR vehicular networks deployment, multiple radio access networks may coexist in the overlapping areas having different characteristics in terms of multiple attributes. The CR vehicular node may have the capability to make call for two or more types of nonsafety services such as voice, video, and best effort simultaneously. Hence, it becomes difficult for MR to select optimal network for the spectrum handoff. This can be done by performing spectrum handoff using Multiple Attributes Decision Making (MADM) methods which is the objective of the paper.

Since the cost, complexity and time precludes realisation of actual system, co-simulation technique has been effectively implemented for this investigation. Co-simulation combines advanced virtual prototyping and control technology which offers a novel approach to investigate the dynamics of such complex system. The simulations for the integrated control system along with multi body model of the vehicle are carried out for the control strategies, viz. continuous sky hook control, cascade loop control and cascade loop with ride control and compared with passive suspension system. The vehicle with 8x8 configuration is run on the real world obstacle profiles, viz. step, trench, trapezoidal bump and corrugated road and the effect of control strategies on ride comfort, wheel displacement and ground reaction is presented. It is observed that cascade loop with ride control in semi-active mode offers better vehicle ride comfort while crossing the said obstacles. The improved performance parameters are achieved through stabilisation of heave, pitch and roll motions of the vehicle through outer loop and isolation of vehicle level uneven disturbances through the fuzzy logic controller employed in inner loop. © 2017, DESIDOC.","Co-simulation; Multi-body dynamics; Obstacle crossing; Semi-active suspension","Active suspension systems; Armor; Armored vehicles; Automation; Automobile bodies; Automobile suspensions; Axles; Cobalt compounds; Fuzzy logic; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Military vehicles; Quality control; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Cosimulation; Fuzzy logic controllers; Multi-body dynamic; Obstacle crossings; Passive suspension system; Semi active suspension; Semi-active suspension controls; Semi-active suspension systems; Suspensions (components)",,,"Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre",0011748X,,DSJOA,,"English","Def.

In range-free algorithms, only received signal strength (RSS) information between nodes is sufficient to determine the position of target nodes. RSS value gives the clue to find out the distance between sensor nodes but shows non-linearity between RSS and distance. To overcome this non-linearity, fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used.

For these kind applications preferably we choose multilevel inverters. The multilevel inverters are used to convert DC input power to AC output power with more number of voltage levels and with less Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). In this paper, we evolved a new technique, soft switching for unique power converter called stacked multicell converter (SMC). The fuzzy logic controller used to controls the multi levels of operation for Stacked Multicell Converter. As compared to the conventional converter, This SMC topology provides more input voltage levels, reduces the converter energy storage, and also reduces the voltage and current burden on semiconductor switching devices.

Often the realistic visualization can override critical assessment of the content and stunt creative exploration. As stated by Wergles and Muhar realistic visualizations cause a “genuine excitement and anticipation” that can bias the decision makers. This paper explores the influence of various representation techniques on the decision-making during the idea exploration phase for new products. The paper presents idea explorations and representations generated during a design course. The documented ideas were evaluated by an expert panel for their implemental value and uniqueness. The evaluating criteria was determined and defined for setting a rating scale to demonstrate the influence of the representation techniques on the implement-ability and uniqueness of the ideas in the realm of designing new products. As mentioned by Abdelhameed, the media used by designers affects the process of design exploration and design thinking. Certain ideas can only be derived from specific tools and from individual use of media. Precise and realistic representations leave very little room for intended and controlled ambiguity, which is a prerogative for creative judgment in the idea generation phase. The findings can help to formulate a conclusive representation technique to help maximize creative exploration and outcome. This can further assist student and novice designers to develop effective and unique designs and overcome the constraints of realistic visualization during idea exploration. Even a roughly finished idea having deep explorative attributes has the potential of creative product output. The only point of concern in rating such ideas is that it requires experienced experts from the field to gauge the creative potential. Further work needs to be carried out to set certain steps of operation to maintain the flow of exploration, no matter what the mode of representation might be, as this investigation does not fall in the purview of the existing study. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Design decisions; Idea exploration; Representation techniques","Curricula; Decision making; Visualization; Creative potentials; Critical assessment; Design decisions; Evaluating criteria; Exploratory studies; Idea representation; New product design; Representation techniques; Product design","Joshi, P.; Industrial Design Centre, IIT BombayIndia; email: purba_joshi@iitb.ac.in","Chakrabarti A.Chakrabarti D.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",21903018,9789811035203,,,"English",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018445981

The dynamic weight of bulk material on the belt is measured with a belt weigh bridge and the belt speed is controlled to compensate for the variation in weight so that the feed rate is maintained constant. The problem of belt speed control is challenging as the dynamic response of system is nonlinear and there are frequent changes in belt load due to variation in bulk material characteristics. The control accuracy of belt weigh feeder is fully dependent on the controller performance in providing precise control of speed of motor/belt. Any delay in achieving the set feed rate or frequent deviation between set and actual feed rate affects the quality and efficiency of downstream process. Conventional PI controller is unable to provide optimum control due to system nonlinearity. To tackle these problems, first the system is modeled and rigorously simulated in open and closed loop to have a better insight into its nonlinear response. Subsequently, PI Fuzzy Logic controller is designed for control of belt weigh feeder. The results indicate substantial improvement in control accuracy of the system with PI Fuzzy Logic controller. © 2017 IEEE.","Belt Weigh Feeder; Fuzzy Logic; Modelling; Nonlinearity","Belt conveyors; Computer circuits; Controllers; Feeding; Fuzzy logic; Models; Controller performance; Conventional-PI controller; Downstream process; Electromechanical systems; Non-linear response; Nonlinearity; System nonlinearities; Weigh feeders; Process control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) forms a major part of thus ecosystem that comprises of mobile vehicles capable of generating, storing and moreover processing the data flowing through the system. The vehicles continuously communicate with each other and with the external environment to collect and process real-time information. This collaboration provides a means to build up optimized routing decisions that may lead to the improvement in overall congestion suffered by the network. In this paper, we apply two optimization algorithms Any Colony and Firefly Optimization, on the real-time data collected from various vehicular sources to provide them optimized and congestion-free routes. Various road parameters have been considered that may affect the selection of a particular route toward the destination. The results of experimental setup, conducted using two open source simulators NS2 and SUMO, have shown a predominant enhancement by reducing the average travelling time of the vehicles in the complete system taken into consideration. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ant colony optimization; Internet of vehicles; Route optimization","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Decision making; Ecology; Ecosystems; Open systems; Optimization; Smart city; Collaborative decision making; External environments; Intelligent devices; Optimization algorithms; Optimized routing; Real-time information; Route availabilities; Route optimization; Vehicles","Chowdhary, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lyallpur Khalsa College of EngineeringIndia; email: nitikachowdhary@ieee.org","Luhach A.K.Raman B.Singh D.Lingras P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811057793,,,"English","Commun.

These systems are not only the place for safe disposal of huge quantity of urban sewage, but also provider of food and employment. Anthropogenic interference with commercial interest and process of urbanization has made the system dynamic and vulnerable towards exploitation. Wetlands are often misunderstood as wastelands, and as a result easy victims of the development process. Fortunately water policies do exists in India that supports and accepts the wastewater reuse. For efficient utilization and conservation of these wetland ecosystems, proper assessment and mapping is essential. In this regard, there exists a huge gap. Selection of mapping and modeling techniques for wastewater-fed aquaculture system requires the understanding of the complex components related to social, economic, technical, and environmental processes; possible trade-off variables; and its related social and economic costs. All these related datasets are sometimes incomplete and vague, which are difficult to be captured by traditional threshold-based models. Such uncertainties can be addressed by fuzzy logic, whereby fuzzy set theory provides a unifying framework for vague and fuzzy information processing. This paper presents a conceptual framework of Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for wetland risk mapping and assessment. The framework integrates multiple risk factors and quantification of uncertainties within a system to generate consistent outcome. Remote sensing and GIS plays an integral part in generating the base layers for the system. FIS-based wetland risk assessment includes: definition of membership functions, determination of linguistic variable, construction of fuzzy rules, determination of model properties, and defuzzyfication. The fuzzy inference-based decision support system for wetland risk mapping presented here can be a useful tool for decision makers involved in the planning and management of the ecosystem. © 2017 ACRS.

There are many real-life applications (like smart city planning and urban development) where public (skilled or unskilled) opinions play a better role in comparison with single expert opinion. A spectrum of algorithms has already been proposed for obtaining robust consensus judgment from multiple crowd opinions. In most of the problems, for a particular question we receive a single opinion with multiple options. But in this article, we have proposed a new research problem termed as constrained judgment analysis problem that consists of the questions having multiple opinions. Moreover, some constraints among the options are required to be satisfied while giving opinions. In this constrained judgment analysis, the traditional way of decision making, like majority voting, weighted voting or probablistic model, cannot be applied directly due to the purpose of constraint satisfaction. In this work, we have also proposed a probabilistic method for obtaining final solution for constrained judgment analysis problem and demonstrated its efficacy over a synthetic dataset, thereby proving its utility in resource allocation for smart city planning. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

They are recognized widely for their ecological and economic services. Due to spurt in anthropogenic activities as well as increased frequency of natural episodic events, mangrove coverage and health gets vastly affected. Thus, keeping the importance of mangroves in mind, it is of utmost importance to monitor the health of existing mangroves. The main objective of this study is to assess the ecological health of various mangrove species of Purna River in Navsari district of south Gujarat. Mangroves health assessment model developed by Space Application Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, is simulated by analyzing the important indicators such as Canopy cover, Stand size, Drainage density, Reclamation activities and anthropogenic stress. The magnitude of each parameter is given based on its relative importance in mangroves health. The entire study area is overlaid with a grid of 1 × 1 hectare. Each parameter is calculated and mapped using Resourcesat-2 satellite imagery of different time frames between 2007 and 2015 as well as in-situ measurements. The final output of the model is in the form of the map which shows present health of the mangroves. The study area is also classified based on retrieved index into pristine, vulnerable, degrading and degraded. The result showed approx. 0.60 sq.km areas is degraded, 0.35 sq.km showed degrading health condition. Approximately 12.50 sq. km area showed pristine health condition and 0.80 sq. km showed vulnerable health condition. Here, it can be concluded that the possible causes for mangrove degradation are aquaculture practices and high turbidity in this region. This, in turn, can lead to the decision makers as well as community developers to plan such activities in regions so as not to affect the mangrove health in any way.

With advancement in technology and emerging of various intelligent prediction techniques, it has now become possible to imbibe the traditional video surveillance with intelligence to identify or take decision according to the scenarios. Intelligent video surveillance system (IVS) based on image recognition is widely employed to effectively avert crimes and provide public security. Due to the high complexity of processing real time data and analysis/understanding of image contents, a well-developed user friendly and cost effective product is not present for use. This paper is an outcome of comparative analysis of extracts drawn from literature review of 57 IEEE papers ranging from year 1977 to the year 2015, carried out to understand the suspicious activity detection methodologies used for detecting abnormal human behavior, tracing abandoned object, or unattended baggage etc., which led to an extensive comparison between various proposed methods.

Here, our analysis presents the identification of zebra in their natural habitat. All the techniques are tested on 824 Plains zebra images captured at Ol’Pejeta conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya. We have used coat strips as a biometric identifier which is unique in nature. To improve the performance of identification, information fusion of coat strips can be taken place from many points in zebra skin such as near legs, stomach and neck. Here two region near stomach (flake) and first limb (leg) is cropped from the textural pattern of strips of zebra is used in feature extraction. GMF, AAD, mean, and eigenface feature extraction methods are applied on flake and limb ROI of zebra. Then a novel image enhancement method: difference subplane adaptive histogram equalization is applied to improve the identification rate. Our technique is based on information fusion in fusing the score from stomach (flake) and first limb (leg) region. For this, sum, product, frank T-norm, and Hamacher T-norm rules are applied to validate the identification results.

Reliable power from renewable energy sources has become very important in today‘senergy scenario mainly due to the shortage of fossil fuels. Wind energy is one of the promising renewable energy sources for the future. But the fluctuating nature of wind introduces power quality issues like harmonics and deviations in voltage waveform in the grid, which in turn affects the stability of the entire grid. This paper aims at reducing these issues using Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), one of the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices. The incoming power from the wind power plant is fed through Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), which is connected at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). The power quality is analyzed using Total Harmonics Distortion (THD) as a performance measure which is simulated in SIMULINK/MATLAB. The UPFC is controlled using Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks instead of conventional Proportional Integral (PI) Controller and the results are compared. It is found that the Neural Network control gives the lowest THD among all the three methods. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The novelty behind the proposed middleware development is in achieving high-degree configuration and customisability by selecting a subset of middleware functionality depending on the need. The conventional service selection approaches do not consider QoUE and QoS as a whole; they expect the user to provide a set of QoS constraints. The selection approach is based on the MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) decision-making method. The experimental results are encouraging and the middleware performs well when compared to the constraint model and linear programming models.

The major difficulties associated with these conventional methods for MR brain image segmentation are the Intensity Non-uniformity (INU) and noise. In this paper, EM and FCM with spatial information and bias correction are proposed to overcome these effects. The spatial information is incorporated by convolving the posterior probability during E-Step of the EM algorithm with mean filter. Also, a method of pixel re-labeling is included to improve the segmentation accuracy.

Reliability of the whole system depends on the stability and consistency of its decision-making unit. Real-time decision making is another challenge in the field on which the research community has been focusing on improving the performance of the underlying models. The underlying models are usually the learning models, that act as a smart engine after being sufficiently trained for the process. In this paper, we propose to use a decision tree model that has the capability of handling uncertainty in the acquired data from the environment. The resulting model is called as Fuzzy Granular Decision Tree (FGDT). Series of evaluation of FGDT shows that the model is stable and powerful for the presently considered problem.

Software Reliability is similarly an imperative factor manipulating structure with reliability [2]. It contrasts from hardware reliability in the way that it reflects the outline faultlessness, and to provide reliable software. The elevated intricacy of software is the major contributing element of Software Reliability issues. Software reliability engineering (SRE) surveys how well software based items and administrations meet client's operational needs. SRE utilizes quantitative techniques in view of reliability measures to do this evaluation. The essential objective of SRE is to boost consumer loyalty. SRE uses such quantitative strategies as factual estimation and expectation, estimation, and displaying. As the reliability of an item or administration is profoundly subject to working conditions and the reliability of software is identified with how the product is utilized, the quantitative portrayal of the utilization of software is an indispensable part in SRE. Software Cost Estimation with resonating unwavering quality, profitability and improvement exertion is a testing and burdensome undertaking. This has prompted the product group to give much required push and dig into broad research in Software exertion estimation for developing refined strategies. Estimation by similarity is one of the practical strategies in Software exertion estimation field. Be that as it may, the technique used for the estimation of Software exertion by similarity can't deal with the all-out information in an express and exact way. Another approach has been created in this paper to assess Software exertion for ventures spoke to by all out or numerical information utilizing thinking by similarity and fluffy approach. The current chronicled datasets, investigated with fluffy rationale, deliver precise brings about correlation with the dataset examined with the before approaches. Software designing is a more extensive training of which SRE is a sub train. Software building is worried about all parts of outlining, executing, and dealing with the advancement of software [8]. Different parts of software building incorporate the financial aspects of creating software and the interfaces between software, frameworks, and people and with the practices and procedures for guaranteeing the nature of conveyed software. In this paper we ponder the product reliability of frameworks with the assistance of past failure related informational collections by utilizing Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN) methods, Numerical cases are appeared with both real and mimicked datasets.

While each of these outcomes is important for both, the government and its citizens; we know little about how various factors mediate the effectiveness of ICTs on producing these outcomes. This study tries to find out the factors responsible for the successful implementation of e-governance. Four factors related to technology, organisational, legal and regulatory aspects and implementation aspects are measured using latent variables and the causal relationship between them are captured in the hypothetical model. The hypotheses conceptualised in the study are tested using structural equation model and the relationships are established. The study results in some interesting findings. The results show that the technological aspects and the organisational aspects are dominant in influencing the implementation of electronic governance in the state of Odisha.

The major act to disclose the identity is through exploring the pattern of attributes involved in data formation. The existing benchmarking models are anonymizing the data either by generalizing, deleting the sensitive attributes, or adding noise to the data. Either of these approaches is not guaranteed in optimality and accuracy in results that obtained from the mining models applied on that data set. The deviation in results often causes falsified decision-making, which is unconditionally not acceptable in certain domains like health mining. To fill the gap, here, we proposed a novel hybridization of feature set partitioning and data restructuring to achieve the pattern anonymization. The model is particularly aimed to restructure the data for supervised learning. To the best of our knowledge, pattern anonymization is first of its kind that attempted to anonymize the patterns rather individual attributes.

Electromyography techniques can be employed with the diagnosis of muscular nerve compression and expansion abnormalities and other problems of muscles and nervous systems. An electromyogram (EMG) signal detects the electrical potential activities generated by muscle cells. These cells are activated by electrochemical signals and neurological signals. It is so difficult for the neurophysiologist to distinguish the individual waveforms generated from the muscle. Thus, the classification and feature extraction of the EMG signal becomes highly necessary. The principle of independent component analysis (ICA), fast Fourier transform (FFT) and other methods is used as dimensionality reduction methods of different critical signals extracted from human body. These different existing techniques for analysis of EMG signals have several limitations such as lower recognition rate waveforms, sensitive to continuous training and poor accuracy. In this chapter, the EMG signals are trained using soft computing techniques like adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). ANFIS is the hybrid network where fuzzy logic principle is used in neural network. This proposed technique has different advantages for better training of the EMG signals using ANFIS network with a higher reliability and better accuracy. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) method is used for feature extraction of the signal. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Classification; Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT); Electromyogram (EMG); Feature extraction; Neuromuscular disorders","Classification (of information); Computation theory; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electromyography; Extraction; Fast Fourier transforms; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Independent component analysis; Intelligent computing; Muscle; Neurophysiology; Signal analysis; Signal detection; Soft computing; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Dimensionality reduction method; Discrete wavelet transformation; Electrochemical signals; Electromyogram; Independent component analysis(ICA); Neuromuscular disorders; Softcomputing techniques; Biomedical signal processing","Mahapatra, S.; Department of ETC, Trident Academy of Technology, BPUTIndia; email: mahapatra.sakuntala@gmail.com","Popentiu-Vladicescu F.Patnaik S.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811037788,,,"English","Adv.

In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy based flame analysis, which consider Red, Green and Blue intensity planes, to measure the temperature from the flame image. The proposed approach integrates RGB intensity as fuzzified input variables, temperature as defuzzified output variables and fuzzy inference rules based Mamdani models. Based on the color characteristics of burning flame, temperature of different flame zones are located using a fuzzy logic controller. The temperature level at hotspot area is the highest and through the fuzzy analysis we were able to identify hotspot area from the flame image. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, quantitative metric such as f-measure has been used and it was found that the f-measure metric yields high accuracy for the hotspot area. The visual inspection of the results along with the f-measure values showed the superiority of our work.

Such agents will be more effective if it’s behavior is closer to human or it is intelligent enough to understand the possible course of action taken by the human user. Therefore recognizing intention of the human driver and surrounding vehicles is an essential task. We have formulated a fuzzy model for the prediction of intention. A qualitative distance and orientation mechanism have been adopted, where few environment features are taken to show how the prediction of intention can improve the ability of decision making. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Autonomous vehicle navigation; Intent recognition; Motion planning; Obstacle avoidance","Collision avoidance; Decision making; Motion planning; Navigation; Robotics; Robots; Wheelchairs; Autonomous machines; Autonomous vehicle navigation; Cognitive decision makings; Independent living; Intent recognition; Mobility assistance; Orientation mechanism; Rehabilitation robotics; Autonomous agents","Pushp, S.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: sumantpushp@gmail.com","Pal R.Ghosh A.Prasath R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319719276,,,"English","Lect.

On composing different available services to satisfy end user requirement is a critical challenge in MANETs (""Mobile Ad Hoc Network"") due to dynamic topology, Resource heterogeneity, Bandwidth constraint and highly distributed service providers. Existing composition services approaches are not suitable for MANETs due to lack of constraints consideration while choosing services. In this paper, we proposed Fuzzy based optimal QoS constrained Service Composition in MANETs. We consider Energy constraint, hop count, Response time & service throughput as QoS Constraints composing optimal services. We proposed fuzzy logic based system to provide a rating to the services for optimal selection of services. We also considered that each node can provide one or more services. The service composition failure rate will be reduced by selecting optimal services in available services.

Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) is an advanced form of WSN with node mobility which is highly useful in several real time applications. Energy efficiency is the major challenge while designing MWSN. Clustering is one of the important energy efficient techniques to effectively utilize the available resources and also node mobility relieves hotspots problem. Clustering is the process of grouping the nodes into clusters. A cluster consists of a Cluster Head (CH) and number of cluster members. CH is responsible for collecting data from cluster members, aggregating it and forwarding the aggregated data to Base Station (BS). So, CH selection plays a vital role to preserve energy in MWSN. As CH selection influences the overall performance of the MWSN, many researchers are carried out to select the proper CHs. In this paper, a dynamic CH selection using Fuzzy logic is proposed. The fuzzy input parameters are residual energy, distance to BS and node mobility. The output parameter is the probability of becoming CH. The proposed method is compared to the well known clustering protocol LEACH. Simulation results shows that the proposed method produces better results than LEACH interms of energy consumption and network lifetime. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

But there are also some limitations for trapping Solar Energy. A major disadvantage of trapping Solar Energy in photovoltaic cells is that it's operating point changes with changing insolation and temperature which in turn reduces its overall efficiency. Therefore, it becomes imperative that maximum power should be derived from solar PV panels via Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) which in turn increases its efficiency. In this paper, a PV model has been used to simulate actual PV arrays behavior, and then a Maximum Power Point tracking method using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is proposed in order to control the on goings of the DC-DC Buck Boost Converter.

It is often used for enhancing skills of decision making, analytical thinking, planning and execution. Though numerous games have been developed in training professionals in sectors such as manufacturing, education, health care and sports, very less have been developed for IT professionals. It has been proven in literature that the project management owing to its nature of work in IT organization is very different from these sectors. This also implies that the skills needed for project management must be very specific to IT industry. In our study, a game is designed with a primary focus on richness of context with a purpose of improving decision-making skills of a Project Manager in Information Technology (IT) organization. We conducted contextual survey along with literature review for identifying the scenarios, and user journey of project manager. Knowing the context, an analogy of hospital scenarios was applied for ideation and concept generation for this video game. The designed prototype was evaluated with fourteen users for meeting the learning and play objectives. Our findings suggest that serious games using an analogy (i.e., hospital scenario in this study) can be engaging and purposeful learning tools, when the user context is well understood, converted to an equivalent game play and situated in a metaphorical, fantasized or analogical world.

To overcome the ambiguity and impreciseness, Zadeh [20] introduced fuzzy set theory in the year 1965. The underlying power of fuzzy sets is that linguistic variables can be used rather than quantitative variables to represent imprecise concepts which are continuous transitions. The continuous imprecise concepts need to be modeled by continuous fuzzy numbers instead of intervals and real numbers. Many researchers applied triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which are piecewise linear and continuous for imprecise concepts because of its convenience and ease. But imprecise variables in the fields of decision making, data analysis, fuzzy control, image processing, fuzzy clustering etc., need not be linear always. So parabolic fuzzy numbers can be used for modeling nonlinear fuzzy concepts to have a better accuracy in real life problems. Since parabolic fuzzy numbers are not completely studied till now and the triangular fuzzy numbers have been thoroughly studied, triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers may be used as supplementary tool along with parabolic fuzzy numbers. Approximation is a kind of de-fuzzification that has to change non-linear functions into linear functions which reduces the fuzziness for the undefined information and produces a better accuracy. So the study of approximation of parabolic fuzzy numbers is necessary and hence, in this paper, the problem of triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers is attempted using distance function in terms of α-cuts. Some properties of the parabolic fuzzy numbers which are useful in multi criteria decision making (MCDM) have also been discussed. Finally pertinent illustrations and applications of the approximation of parabolic fuzzy number have also been given. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

In this work, we have proposed a novel alert fusion method which overcomes the limitations of existing fusion methods and fulfils the requirements for alert fusion domain. We have demostrated the results for two different approaches of deriving reliability value of intrusion system detector which are based on conflict and true positive rate of intrusion detectors.

Due to node mobility, heavy packet dropping occurs, which leads to packet overhead and links break. The previous routing protocols are vulnerable to node mobility especially for large-scale networks. Due to this issue, an Efficient Multipath Routing Protocol (EMRP) using fuzzy logic controller is proposed which takes advantage of the stateless property of geographic routing and the broadcast nature of wireless medium. In this protocol, both stability and mobility are calculated to determine network reliability. The reliable multipath is constructed based on network topology. Both link and node reliability is determined to enable novel routing based on calculation of stability. Fuzzy logic control procedure is implemented with reliability to increase the network performance. This system is used in ad hoc network to determine its reliability.

Temperature is the important parameter which is required to be controlled in exothermic CSTRs. The reason for this is the huge temperature variations. These variations are the cause of side reactions which in turn can result in wrong final product. It is desirable that CSTR operates on the desired temperature. Hence, controlling the temperature of CSTR is of prime concern for any process engineer.

The Shivalik Landscape of Uttarakhand, Haryana and south eastern Himachal Pradesh is the north-western limit of wild population of Asian elephant. Elephant habitat in this landscape is characterized by mixed moist and dry deciduous forests. Geomorphologically southern aspect is highly dissected supporting mix of dry and moist deciduous forests, while northern aspect has moist deciduous forest of Shorea robusta (Sal) and its associates like Mallotus philippensis (major fodder species of elephant) and Lagerstoemia spp., etc. However, demographic changes including enhanced religious activities and urbanization, patterns of forest resource utilization and cropping, certain management actions, increased industrialization and communication network in last few decades have led to the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and forest cover density. We have attempted to analyse changes in LULC in last 35 years using satellite remote sensing data with an objective to find out changes LULC and cropping patterns for cash crops and the man-elephant conflict zones.

This paper shows that sliding mode (SM) can give better control due to its robust property but it has an unwanted chattering problem associated with it, which is harmful to the plant. To limit this problem a hybrid controller is presented in which a fuzzy controller is combined with the SM controller by a fuzzy supervisory system in such a way that the SM controller works in transient state and the fuzzy controller in steady state. The simulation results show that the SM controller is more robust when compared to PID and fuzzy control and hybrid control gives overall better system performance and reduced chattering when compared to SM control.

To overcome such problems, a novel neuro-fuzzy controller is proposed in this paper for single-shaft heavy-duty gas turbines ranging from 18.2 MW to 106.7 MW. A neuro-fuzzy controller was developed using a hybrid learning algorithm and the effectiveness of the controller for all heavy-duty gas turbine plants (5, 6, 7, and 9 series) is demonstrated against load disturbance and set-point variation in a grid-connected environment. Various time domain specifications and performance index criteria of the neuro-fuzzy controller are compared with that of a fuzzy logic controller and an artificial neural network controller. The simulation results indicate that the neuro-fuzzy controller yields optimal transient and steady-state responses and tracks set-point variation faster than a fuzzy logic or artificial neural network controller. Hence, the neuro-fuzzy controller is identified as an optimal controller for heavy-duty gas turbine plants. The neuro-fuzzy controller proposed in this paper is also applicable to the latest derivative Speedtronic controller. © TÜBİTAK.","Artificial neural network controller; Fuzzy logic controller; Heavy duty gas turbine; Neuro-fuzzy controller; Simplified model; Speedtronic governor","Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Neural networks; Artificial neural network controllers; Fuzzy logic controllers; Heavy-duty gas turbines; Hybrid learning algorithm; Neuro-fuzzy controller; Performance indices; Steady-state response; Time-domain specifications; Gas turbine power plants","Mohamed Iqbal, M.M.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sri Ramakrishna Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: mohdiq_m@yahoo.co.in",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020731967

Realistic and mechanically robust structure for a prosthetic arm was developed in Solid Works. The torque, power requirements and cost estimation were assessed systematically by interfacing the model with SimMechanics software. The robotic arm is equipped with several robot servo motors which perform as links between arms and perform arm movements by interfacing with a robot servo controller and the PIC16F886 microcontroller. The robot servo controller has the capability to drive the servo in controlled position, speed, and acceleration modes. Due to the complexity of the arm kinematics, machine-learning techniques, which rely less on precise mathematical analysis, are implemented. ANFIS is one such machine-learning technique which helps in decision-making and control of robotic arms. This paper implements a MATLAB-derived multilayered ANFIS controller using a PIC16F886 microcontroller as a supervisory control for a 6 DOF robotic arm. This type of robotic arm has many advantages such as simple structure, high flexibility, low energy consumption, quiet operation, and sensory feedback which make it a prosthetic arm with very high resemblance to a normal arm. A good tradeoff between cost and performance is achieved in order to meet the goal of less expensive and useful robotic arm for the disabled. The practically built arm is tested with predefined paths and random positional targets with in work space and results are shown to act satisfactorily. © springer international publishing switzerland 2017.","ANFIS; Clustering; Control system; Fuzzy logic; Prosthetics; Robotic arm; Servo motor; SimMechanics","Anthropomorphic robots; Artificial intelligence; Control systems; Controllers; Cost estimating; Decision making; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent robots; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; MATLAB; Microcontrollers; Prosthetics; Robotic arms; Robots; Sensory feedback; ANFIS; Clustering; Low energy consumption; Machine learning techniques; Mathematical analysis; Mechanical structures; Mechanically robust; SimMechanics; Robotics","Aswath, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa VidyapeethamIndia; email: aswathashh10@gmail.com","Karray F.Kim J.-H.Myung H.Jo J.Sincak P.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9783319312910,,,"English","Adv.

But the limitations of battery and processing power of smart phones are making it inferior to laptops and desktop computers. Mobile Cloud Offloading (MCO) allows the smart phones to offload computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, making it more effective in terms of energy, speed or both. Increased networking capacity due to the availability of high speed Wi-Fi and cellular connections like 3G/4G makes offloading more efficient. Even then, the choice of offloading is not always advisable, because of the highly dynamic context information of mobile devices and clouds. In this paper, we propose a dynamic decision making system, which will decide whether to offload or do the tasks locally, depending on the current context information and the optimization choice of the user. Metrics are developed for time, energy and combination of time and energy to assess the proposed system.

Since nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN) are energy constrained and replenishment of resources is generally not feasible, continuous research efforts are directed towards ensuring conservation of energy, so that network longevity may be maximized. This paper discusses the working philosophies of various clustering, tree and cluster-tree protocols and their energy conserving practices. A summarization of cluster-tree protocols with their salient features, problems addressed and limitations is also provided. Next, a mathematical analysis of energy consumption in ideal cases of cluster and cluster tree based protocols is presented. It is observed that cluster head election is the costliest process in a WSN and there is a scope to optimize this process in order to save energy. Hence, this paper proposes Energy Saving Using Memorization (ESUM); a novel energy-efficient and fault tolerant algorithm for cluster-tree based routing, that uses energy conservation to enhance network longevity, by using saved results and avoiding re-elections after each round. ESUM also handles CH failures efficiently as it uses memorized results to replace failed cluster heads thus saving both time and energy. The algorithm uses fuzzy logic for localization of motes to account for the irregularities like fading and multipath communication in wireless communication. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cluster based protocols; Cluster-tree based protocols; Energy conservation; Fault tolerance; Fuzzy logic; Localization; Network longevity; Tree based protocols; WSN",,"Jaspal, S.S.; Amity UniversityIndia; email: shalini.jaspal@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",1860949X,,,,"English","Stud.

Tragically in India, a growing slum population and lack of adequate sanitation makes over 50 million men and women to defecate in the open every day. This research paper sought to measure attitudes and behaviour towards toilet construction and its utilization by the poor people in urban areas in India. The survey collected primary data through questionnaire and analysed by cross tabulation, decision tree using chi-Square automatic interaction detector, multiple classification analysis, and logistic regression. Findings guided the design of a mass media communication campaign to impact toilet construction, its increased uptake, universal and consistent use of safe sanitation among poor urban communities, to reduce open defecation in urban areas. Results of the study demonstrate, principally, that while both women, and men, use toilets more during the rainy season, the drop-outs among men in the summer is greater than for women. The paper also documents new evidence on the pathways to decision-making regarding toilet use providing key insights for Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) campaign architects. It also presents evidence on how non-users behave with regard to their usage of community toilets and construction of toilets. © 2017 The Authors.

It is the prime power drive in industrial Applications. But due to the progress in engineering technology the speed of the Induction Motor can be varied within certain limitations. There are many techniques to control and run the machine in Variable speed drive applications. The basic method is 2-level inverter controlled by the microcontroller, using the space vector modulation method. By this method the output of the inverter will be Non-sinusoidal and hence at the star point of the load there exists a Voltage with respect to ground and it is known as Common Mode Voltage, induces electromagnetic interference which causes disturbance to the nearby communication and electronics equipment. To reduce the Common Mode Voltage a higher level of inverter 3-level can be used. By using the 3-level inverter the number of devices will be increased to twelve from six for 2-level. There is a method with less number of devices, nine for 3-level inverter, which gives better performance in terms of Common Mode Voltage than the 3-level method with twelve devices. In this paper the authors have discussed the 2-level, 3-level with twelve devices and 3-level with nine devices by simulation using MATLAB-Simulink and by Experiment. For 3-level inverter twelve devices, the Common Mode Voltage values are taken from the earlier published results. Fast Fourier transform has been done using the signal Analysis software and results are plotted with frequency versus voltage. The Phase Voltage, Line voltage and Common Mode Voltage are measured using Agilent make mixed signal oscilloscope.

In most of the industries the induction motor is mainly used for Drive Systems. But due to the advances in computer technology the speed of the induction motor can be controlled under certain conditions. There are many ways to control the speed of the Induction Motor for variable speed applications. The basic method is 2-level inverter controlled by microcontroller using space vector modulation. In this method the output of the inverter may not be exactly sinusoidal and hence at the star point of the Induction Motor winding, causing a Voltage Harmonic Distortion in the output of the inverter. To minimize the voltage harmonic distortion a multilevel inverter can be used. In addition, the harmonic frequencies will not produce usable torque but causes heating the Induction motor windings, which are harmful to the insulation. In this paper two level and three level inverter fed induction motor driven at various frequencies are reported. Simulation, experimentation and the measurement of voltage total harmonic distortion have also been reported. In the experiment the Arduino microcontroller, Line Impedance Stabilization Network, opto-isolator, Hall Effect sensor, H-bridge inverter and other necessary electronic circuits are used.

Monitoring of the heritage sites/monuments is essential as they face increasing risk due to unplanned urbanization, tourism, natural and man-made disasters, etc. In this study, geospatial techniques have been used for monitoring six national monuments / heritage sites (for eg. Kalinga monument in Dehradun, old cemetery in Roorkee) in Uttarakhand which are located in diverse geographic and economic conditions with different religious backgrounds. Multi-temporal high resolution satellite images viz., Landsat ETM+ (2000-2001), Cartosat-1 & LISS IV (2009-10) and other ancillary data have been used to monitor the development/expansion around the heritage sites within a specific buffer area encompassing its management zones viz., prohibited and regulated boundary. Landuse / Landcover (LU/LC) change analysis indicated changes in vegetation and built-up area categories, especially in the sites located within a city/town viz., Dehradun and Kashipur as compared to others located in remote areas, providing an important input for authorities for effective management. Evaluation of the tourism potential of these sites has been carried out to suggest planning strategies for overall area improvement including economic development. The tourism potential of the sites have been evaluated based on physical, social, and environmental parameters using weighted ranking method, a popular multi-criteria decision making tool. Based on the total tourist potential scores, the sites have been classified into four categories very high, high, medium and low potential and the planning strategies for improvement has been worked out. The methodology adopted in the study for monitoring can be extended to other nationally important monuments in Uttarakhand region for efficient management and conservation. The weighted ranking approach can be used to prepare a tourism developmental plan for improving the tourist inflows for other important heritage sites and monuments.

The TSK-type feedforward fuzzy neural network does not take the full advantage of the use of the fuzzy rule base in accurate input-output mapping and hence a hybrid model is developed using the Chebyshev polynomial functions to construct the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. The model to be known as locally recurrent neuro fuzzy information system (LRNFIS) is used to provide an expanded nonlinear transformation to the input space thereby increasing its dimension which will be adequate to capture the nonlinearities and chaotic variations in the time series. The locally recurrent nodes will provide feedback connections between outputs and inputs allowing signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. For training the proposed LRNFIS, an improved firefly-harmony search (IFFHS) learning algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the consequent part and feedback loop parameters. Three real world time series databases like the electricity price of PJM electricity market, the widely studied currency exchange rates between US Dollar (USD) and other four currencies i.e. Australian Dollar (AUD), Swiss Franc (CHF), Mexican Peso (MXN), Brazilian Real (BRL), along with S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 stock market data are used for performance validation of the newly proposed LRNFIS. © 2017, the Authors.","Chebyshev polynomials; Currency exchange rate prediction; Electricity price forecasting; Firefly-Harmony search algorithm; Recurrent neuro-fuzzy network; Stock indices prediction; TSK fuzzy rules","Bioluminescence; Commerce; Electronic trading; Feedback; Finance; Financial markets; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Information systems; Mathematical transformations; Polynomials; Power markets; Time series; Chebyshev polynomials; Currency exchange rates; Electricity price forecasting; Harmony search algorithms; Neuro-fuzzy network; Stock indices; TSK fuzzy rules; Fuzzy inference",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",18756891,,,,"English","Int.

This study considers nine types of criteria/factors with fifty-one sub-criteria, which have somewhat previously been used, and creates a ranking model that offers decision makers to measure the prior implementation of cloud computing adoption. A questionnaire-based survey research was used to collect data from 110 firms belonging to the SMEs industry in India. In this paper, the data collected was analysed by an integrated approach. Firstly, an Analytic Hierarchy Process approach was applied to find the significant fact of each criterion as the assessable indices of the cloud computing adoption. Secondly, an Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were used to examine structure, reliability and validity of the criteria. The data was tabulated in a Microsoft Excel sheet and then imported in SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20) for analysis. The findings discovered that 'security and Privacy’, ‘Organizational Risk’, 'sharing and Collaboration’, ‘Confidentiality’, and ‘Integrity’ have a major effect on the adoption of cloud computing. The research was conducted in the SMEs industry in India, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The findings and recommendations offer cloud computing service providers as well as users with a better understanding of what affects the cloud computing adoption feature, with a relevant understanding of the current scenario. The research aided in the application of the new technology of cloud computing adoption in the SMEs industry in India through the use of a wide range of criteria. The findings also help organizations study their information technology investments when applying cloud computing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Analytic hierarchy process; Confirmatory factor analysis; Critical success criteria; Exploratory factor analysis; Scale development; SPSS","Analytic hierarchy process; Cloud computing; Decision making; Multivariant analysis; Network function virtualization; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Confirmatory factor analysis; Critical success criteria; Exploratory factor analysis; Scale development; SPSS; Factor analysis","Raut, R.D.; Operations and Supply Chain Management, National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Room No. 515, ALB Building, 5th Floor, India; email: rraut@nitie.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",10478310,,JTMRE,,"English","J.

The idea is to let the machines communicate their working status to a decision making unit. The collected data on the basis of threat’s priority is used to decide whether to stop the train or let the train move. Whole critical machinery will be having their local error detection and correction mechanisms through sensors and transducers. A global sink placed off the train where the decision will be made by calculating a risk score. If the risk score is higher than the threshold then the train is signaled to stop immediately.

Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) is an advanced form of WSN with node mobility which is highly useful in several real time applications. Energy efficiency is the major challenge while designing MWSN. Clustering is one of the important energy efficient techniques to effectively utilize the available resources and also node mobility relieves hotspots problem. Clustering is the process of grouping the nodes into clusters. A cluster consists of a Cluster Head (CH) and number of cluster members. CH is responsible for collecting data from cluster members, aggregating it and forwarding the aggregated data to Base Station (BS). So, CH selection plays a vital role to preserve energy in MWSN. As CH selection influences the overall performance of the MWSN, many researchers are carried out to select the proper CHs. In this paper, a dynamic CH selection using Fuzzy logic is proposed. The fuzzy input parameters are residual energy, distance to BS and node mobility. The output parameter is the probability of becoming CH. The proposed method is compared to the well known clustering protocol LEACH. Simulation results shows that the proposed method produces better results than LEACH interms of energy consumption and network lifetime. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

A temporal association pattern is said to be similar if it satisfies specified subset constraints. The apriori algorithm which is designed for static databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns from temporal databases as patterns are vectors with supports computed at different time slots and Euclidean distance do not satisfy monotonicity property. The brute force approach to find similar temporal patterns requires computing 2n true support combinations for ‘n’ items from finite item set and problem falls in NP-class. In this present research, we come up with novel approach to discover temporal association which are similar for pre-specified subset constraints, and substantially reduce support computations. The proposed approach eliminates computational overhead in finding similar temporal patterns. The results prove that the proposed method outperforms brute force approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Prevalance; Subset specification; Support bounds; Temporal pattern","Bayesian networks; Database systems; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Image processing; Robot programming; Soft computing; Swarm intelligence; Brute-force approach; Computational overheads; Computationally efficient; Monotonicity property; Prevalance; Similar temporal patterns; Temporal association; Temporal pattern; Computation theory","Radhakrishna, V.; VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: radhakrishna_v@vnrvjiet.in","Matousek R.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9783319580876,,,"English","Adv.

It is a central repository of integrated data from one or more different sources. Now a day's data warehouse considered as one of the core component of business intelligence. The performance of traditional data warehouse become degraded when the report generation needs on a fly or the report generation needed only for a specific set of data in some emergency situations. Traditional data warehouse and data marts are based on the time consuming ETL process, hence on-the-fly decision makings are not possible. Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW) is the concept where the data are not required to be cleaned and transformed through ETL. Data in the VDW are schema-less, so the time requirement to form ETL is reduced drastically. Innovation of Service Oriented Computing Paradigm helps to provide the exact functionality to the users on the pay or need basis. The functionalities of VDW could be provided in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) in cloud computing environment using service modeling. Here we have proposed two different architectures to deploy VDW in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with the provision of offering cuboids as a service.","Data mart; Data warehouse; Decision support system; ETL; OLAP; SaaS; SOA; Virtual data warehouse","Artificial intelligence; Data warehouses; Decision making; Decision support systems; Distributed computer systems; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Van der Waals forces; Cloud computing environments; Data mart; Emergency situation; Knowledge workers; OLAP; SaaS; Service oriented computing paradigm; Virtual data warehouse; Software as a service (SaaS)",,"Goto T.Hu G.","The International Society for Computers and Their Applications (ISCA)",,9781943436088,,,"English","Int.

In this study, the significance of offshore/onsite teams (GSD teams) KT effectiveness in GSD projects is measured through various factors: knowledge, team, technology, and organization factors. Moreover, the assessment framework for the integration of knowledge, team, technology, and organization factors for evaluating KT effectiveness in GSD projects has not been adequately available in the existing literature. For this motivation, the main objective of this study is to propose the assessment framework to evaluate offshore/onsite teams KT effectiveness with reference to GSD project outcome. For evaluating KT effectiveness of GSD teams, we have integrated three Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) methodologies: (a) Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL), (b) Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and (c) Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REaite (ELECTRE). Further, the hybridization of fuzzy DEMATEL, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE has not available in the existing literature. Based on this research gap, we have integrated fuzzy DEMATEL, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE approach for evaluating KT effectiveness of offshore/onsite teams in the context of GSD project outcome.

The imprecision in demand is characterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. The triangular fuzzy numbers, counts upon lead time, are used to construct fuzzy lead time demand. It is assumed that the imprecision captured by these fuzzy numbers reduce with time because of learning effect. This implies that the decision maker gathers information about the inventory system and builds up knowledge from the previous shipments. Learning process occurs in setting and estimating the fuzzy parameters to reduce errors and costs. Under these considerations, the proposed model offers a policy and a solution algorithm to calculate the number of orders and reorder level such that the total annual cost attains a minimum value. The results of the proposed model are compared with the continuous review inventory system with fuzzy demand with or without learning effect. It is shown that learning effect in fuzziness reduces the ambiguity associated with the decision making process. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the importance of using learning in fuzzy model. The convexity of the total cost function is also proved. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

The paper introduces a novel approach to provide rehabilitative support to patients suffering from neurological damage in their pre-frontal, parietal and/or motor cortex regions. An attempt to bypass the natural visual-motor pathway is undertaken using interval type-2 fuzzy sets to generate the approximate EEG response of the damaged pre-frontal/parietal/motor cortex from the occipital EEG signals. The approximate EEG response is used to trigger a pre-trained joint coordinate generator to obtain the desired joint coordinates of the link end-points of a robot imitating the human subject. The robot arm is here employed as a rehabilitative aid in order to move each link end-points to the desired locations in the reference coordinate system by appropriately activating its links using the well-known inverse kinematics approach. The mean-square positional errors obtained for each link end-points is found within acceptable limits for all experimental subjects including subjects with partial parietal damage, indicating a possible impact of the proposed approach in rehabilitative robotics. Subjective variation in EEG features over different sessions of experimental trials is modeled here using interval type-2 fuzzy sets for its inherent power to handle uncertainty. Experiments undertaken confirm that interval type-2 fuzzy realization outperforms its classical type-1 counterpart and back-propagation neural approaches in all experimental cases, considering link positional error as a metric. The proposed research offers a new opening for the development of possible rehabilitative aids for people with partial impairment in visual-motor coordination. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Bypassing natural visual-motor pathways; Fuzzy mapping; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Prediction of positional body joint coordinates and Inverse kinematics in Robotics; Rehabilitative aids for visual-motor impairment","Backpropagation; Biomechanics; Brain; Coordination reactions; Fuzzy sets; Inverse kinematics; Kinematics; Point contacts; Robotics; Fuzzy mappings; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Joint coordinates; Motor impairments; Motor pathway; Patient rehabilitation; adult; algorithm; Article; brain computer interface; clinical article; controlled study; electrocorticography; evoked response; executive function; female; fuzzy system; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; mathematical model; methodology; occipital lobe; parietal cortex; prefrontal cortex; rehabilitation equipment; robotics; signal processing; task performance; visuomotor coordination; automated pattern recognition; brain cortex; devices; electroencephalography; fuzzy logic; man machine interaction; middle aged; movement (physiology); Movement Disorders; nerve tract; neurorehabilitation; pathophysiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Adult; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Man-Machine Systems; Middle Aged; Movement; Movement Disorders; Neural Pathways; Neurological Rehabilitation; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Robotics; Sensitivity and Specificity",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15344320,,ITNSB,"27323367","English","IEEE Trans.

Therefore, an adequate Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is designed for classification of brain tumor for assisting inexperience radiologists in diagnosis process. A multifarious database of real post contrast T1-weighted MR images from 10 patients has been taken. This database consists of primary brain tumors namely Meningioma (MENI-class 1), Astrocytoma (AST-class 2), and Normal brain regions (NORM-class 3). The region of interest(s) (ROIs) of size 20 x 20 is extracted by the radiologists from each image in the database. A total of 371 texture and intensity features are extracted from these ROI(s). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to classify these three classes as it shows better classification results on multivariate non-linear, complicated, rule based domains, and decision making domains. It is being observed that ANN provides much accurate results in terms of individual classification accuracy and overall classification accuracy. The four discrete experiments have been performed. Initially, the experiment was performed by extracting 263 features and an overall classification accuracy 78.10% is achieved, however, it was noticed that MENI (class-1) was highly misclassified with AST (class-2). Further, to improve the overall classification accuracy and individual classification accuracy specifically for MENI (class-1), LAWs textural energy measures (LTEM) are added in the feature bank (263+108=371). An individual class accuracy of 91.40% is obtained for MENI (class-1), 91.43% for AST (class-2), 94.29% for NORM (class-3) and an overall classification accuracy of 92.43% is achieved. The results are calculated with and without addition of LTEM feature with Principle component analysis (PCA)-ANN. LTEM-PCA-ANN approach improved results with an overall accuracy of 93.34%. The texture patterns obtained were clear enough to differentiate between MENI (class-1) and AST (class-2) despite of necrotic and cystic component and location and size of tumor. LTEM detected fundamental texture properties such as level, edge, spot, wave and ripple in both horizontal and vertical directions which boosted the texture energy. © 2017, the Authors.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Computer aided diagnosis (CAD); Graphical user interface (GUI); Magnetic resonance (MR); Region of interest(s) (ROIs)","Artificial intelligence; Brain; Database systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Graphical user interfaces; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Tumors; User interfaces; Classification accuracy; Classification results; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Primary brain tumors; Principle component analysis; Region of interest; Computer aided diagnosis",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",18756891,,,,"English","Int.

The relative comparisons of the IF values use all the three parameters, namely membership degree (more the better), non-membership degree (less the better), and hesitancy degree (less the better) leading to trade-off values of the parameters. The modified IF-SIR flows, namely IF-superiority and IF-inferiority flows are calculated using the advantage and disadvantage score matrices, respectively, derived from the relative comparisons. These score matrices are based on positive contributions of all three parameters of the IF values, wherever applicable.

In this paper, we define the concept of absolute degree, total degree, d2-degree of any vertex of an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy graph. Which leads to obtained some significant properties on regular and irregular interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy graph.

However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Fuzzy constrained Boltzmann machine; Link failure; Mobility prediction; Uncertainty; VANET; Vehicular network","Forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Probability distributions; Smart city; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Telecommunication links; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Boltzmann machines; Link failures; Mobility predictions; Uncertainty; VANET; Vehicular networks; Fuzzy logic","Banerjee, S.; Birla Institute of Technology, MesraIndia; email: soumyabanerjee@bitmesra.ac.in","Banerjee S.Bouzefrane S.Boumerdassi S.Sailhan F.Renault E.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319678061,,,"English","Lect.

Alternatively, the utility of integrating decision maker’s (DM’s) preferences into the optimization process so as to target some most preferred solutions by the DM (instead of the whole Paretooptimal front), is also being increasingly recognized. The authors here, have earlier argued that despite the promises in the latter approach, its practical utility may be impaired by the lack of—objectivity, repeatability, consistency, and coherence in the DM’s preferences. To counter this, the authors have also earlier proposed a machine learning based decision support framework to reveal the preference-structure of objectives. Notably, the revealed preference-structure may be sensitive to the timing of application of this framework along an MOEA run. In this paper the authors counter this limitation, by integrating a termination criterion with an MOEA run, towards determining the appropriate timing for application of the machine learning based framework. Results based on three real-world many-objective problems considered in this paper, highlight the utility of the proposed integration towards an objective, repeatable, consistent, and coherent decision support for many-objective problems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Timing circuits; Decision support framework; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Pareto-optimal front; Preference structures; Preferred solutions; Revealed preference; Termination criteria; Decision support systems","Duro, J.A.; Automatic Control and Systems Engineering Department, The University of SheffieldUnited Kingdom; email: j.a.duro@sheffield.ac.uk","Schutze O.Rudolph G.Klamroth K.Jin Y.Trautmann H.Grimme C.Wiecek M.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319541563,,,"English","Lect.

In this paper, a novel trust management model is proposed to alleviate packet dropping attack between data aggregation points of SGCN. The concept of probability theory is used to calculate trust of every node in the network before transmitting the packet. Trust evaluation is conducted in four stages viz., Direct, Indirect, Integrated and Overall trust and in each stage, suitable equations are suggested to measure the trust of each node. A novel technique based on fuzzy set theory is used to route the packet through the trusted channel. Hop count, reliability and capacity of the link are the parameters considered for constructing if-then rules and membership function. A qualitative reasoning is performed using inference mechanism and a defuzzication strategy is applied on the calculated trust value to make decision. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by varying the trust threshold and malicious nodes. From the experiments, it is observed that for all the metrics, the proposed trusted routing using fuzzy theory helps to improve the network performance with much reliable communication and reduced packet loss. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Fuzzy logic; Probability theory; Smart grid communication network; Trust management","Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Electric power transmission networks; Fuzzy set theory; Membership functions; Network routing; Probability; Smart power grids; Inference mechanism; Packet dropping attack; Probability theory; Qualitative reasoning; Reliable communication; Smart Grid Communications; Trust management; Trust management model; Fuzzy logic","Velusamy, D.; Department of Information Technology, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: mvdurgadevi@gmail.com",,"Springer-Verlag Wien",0010485X,,CMPTA,,"English","Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990946668

In both settings, we propose algorithms that are inspired by Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, incorporate cost distortions, and exhibit sublinear regret assuming Hölder continuous weight distortion functions. For the K-armed setting, we show that the algorithm, called W-UCB, achieves problem-dependent regret O (L2M2 log n/δ2/α-1), where n is the number of plays, δ is the gap in distorted expected value between the best and next best arm, L and a are the Holder constants for the distortion function, and M is an upper bound on costs, and a problem-independent regret bound of O((KL2M2)α/2n(2-α)/2). We also present a matching lower bound on the regret, showing that the regret of W-UCB is essentially unimprovable over the class of Hölder-continuous weight distortions. For the linearly parameterized setting, we develop a new algorithm, a variant of the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) algorithm (Abbasi-Yadkori, Pal, and Szépesvári 2011) called WOFUL (Weight-distorted OFUL), and show that it has regret O(dn polylog(n)) with high probability, for sub-Gaussian cost distributions.

Research efforts relevant to these paradigms are focused on the mode selection policies which decide when to switch from CR mode (i.e., opportunistic vacant spectrum access mode) to the RFEH mode (i.e., battery charging using ambient RF energy) and vice-versa. So far, very little attention has been paid to the dual but competing task of frequency band selection in CR and RFEH modes under partially observable environment in the decentralized wireless networks. Furthermore, the need of tunable bandwidth frequency band access for CRs and lower subband switching cost (SSC) for energy efficient implementation have made the design of the decision making policy (DMP) more challenging. In this paper, a new CR-RFEH DMP has been proposed for RFEH enabled CR terminals in the decentralized wireless networks. The proposed DMP consists of three sub-units: 1) Bayesian approach based tunable Thompson sampling algorithm for subband statistics estimation, 2) Thompson sampling algorithm based subband access scheme exploiting the past collision events to minimize collisions among CRs, and 3) Mode selection scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed DMP offers 10–35% improvement in the throughput of the decentralized network and 40–90% reduction in the number of subband switchings compared to existing DMPs. The simulation results are then validated using real radio signals on the proposed USRP testbed. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit algorithms; Radio frequency energy harvesting; Thompson sampling","Bandwidth; Bayesian networks; Decision making; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Learning algorithms; Radio systems; Radio waves; Sampling; Secondary batteries; Wireless networks; Bayesian approaches; Decentralized networks; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Partially observable environments; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Thompson samplings; Cognitive radio","Darak, S.J.; Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, IIITIndia; email: Sumit@iiitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Inc.",10512004,,DSPRE,,"English","Digital Signal Process Rev J",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987941268

Every traction vehicle to be authorised for operation on railway lines must fulfil the limits imposed on current harmonics magnitudes and those provided by railway operators. The solution introduced for prototypes of most modern traction drives is to replace the two-level inverters with three-level topology. Therefore, it is essential to establish the influence of the new solution on the railway signalling system. This paper presents a comparative analysis between simulation results delivered for two and three-level traction drive system regarding generation of disturbing current harmonics. Two types of VSI modulation techniques were taken under consideration: sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) and a new one, proposed by the authors, based on selective harmonic elimination (SHE). Furthermore, the authors presented application of one of the SHE based optimization techniques for shaping the EMU's (electric multiple unit) DC side input current harmonics spectrum in order to meet the required limits. The described technique is based on off-line generation of a set of solutions for each of the VSI operating points and selection of the best solution for the assumed criteria. The applied simulation models and the concept of SHE control were verified in a laboratory by means of a low-power drive stand. Using the three-level inverter in traction drives system results in less current harmonics than using two-level topology without modification of the modulation technique. Thus, it does not guarantee fulfilling all limits assumed in this paper. The proposed modulation technique allows for fulfilling the limits, and the technical implementation of the proposed technique in a traction drive system will be considered in future studies. © 2017 Polish Academy of Sciences.

This data is further used by decision making systems to infer a patient's condition and possibly to motivate a patient to follow a healthy lifestyle by using persuasive system approach. The implementation and maintenance of such systems require specific attention of software engineers for data management because of the complexity involved in the management of various data sources and privacy-related issues of personal data. In this paper, we propose a data model that is generic enough to describe and to support many kinds of telemonitoring applications. These applications include data mining applications which analyse and combine sensor data for a decision making, and persuasive systems which motivate a patient to follow a healthy lifestyle. We show that our data model is useful for a smooth management of data mining outputs and that it avoids the integration efforts in dealing with heterogeneous storage mechanisms. We also show that our data model eases the management of the granularity of data and that it facilitates software designers' tasks for the implementation of privacy protection mechanisms.

This introduces significant ripple on its DC bus voltage, and in the input DC source current. These are normally filtered out by placing a bulk capacitor in the DC bus, which affects the power density. Two novel schemes and control methods are presented, which help reduce the input ripple current considerably, while using a comparatively low-valued DC bus capacitor. These also help improve the power density and reliability of the inverter by reducing the size of the DC bus capacitor. Comparative analysis of the proposed schemes versus legacy schemes is presented. The proposed methods are verified by simulation and experimentation. The results show a significant reduction in peak-to peak ripple at the input. The concept was used and tested in the Little Box Challenge 2kW inverter prototype.

Multiple buyer-supplier power and dependence scenarios are considered to reflect the possible leverages involved in the decision-making. The situational strength evaluated through buyer-supplier power and dependence illuminates the inherent complexity in contract negotiation. Thus there is an evident need to develop risk sharing contracts for mitigating global risks. The developed relationship framework and risk sharing contract model are expected to help SC managers in better understanding behavioural aspects during contract negotiations.

The land suitability was categorized into 5 suitability classes (not-, poorly-, moderately-, good- and highly-suitable) based on a fuzzy logic based land suitability evaluation procedure. The results showed that 60% of marginal lands in UMRB were moderately to highly suitable for growth of the targeted biofeedstock crops. Predicted bioethanol production from marginal land in the UMRB with consideration of suitability level was two thirds of the production predicted without consideration of suitability level. Our results better constrain the potential of marginal land for biofuel production as well as the importance of land suitability evaluation for policy analysis targeting biofuel development on marginal lands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid poplar; Marginal land suitability; Miscanthus; Switchgrass","Bioethanol; Computer circuits; Crops; Plants (botany); Watersheds; Bio-energy; Hybrid poplar; Marginal lands; Miscanthus; Switchgrass; Fuzzy logic; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass power; fuzzy mathematics; grass; growth; policy analysis; river basin; site selection; Mississippi River; United States; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum","Chaubey, I.; Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, 550 Stadium Hall Drive, United States; email: ichaubey@purdue.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",13648152,,EMSOF,,"English","Environ.

The uncertainty definition leads to an improved and effective product style retrieval when combined with fuzzy sets. First, a style knowledge and features database are constructed using fuzzy case-based reasoning technology; a similarity measurement method based on case-based reasoning and fuzzy model of the fuzzy proximity method may be defined by the fuzzy nearest-neighbor algorithm for obtaining the style knowledge extraction. Second, the linguistic variables (LV) are used to assess the product characteristics to establish the product style evaluation database for simplifying the style presentation and decreasing the computational complexity. Third, the model of product style feature set, extracted by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), and the final style related form features set are acquired using LV. This research involves a case study for extracting the key form features of the style of high heel shoes. The proposed algorithms are generated by calculating the weights of each component of high heel shoes using FAHP with LV. The case study and results established that the proposed method is feasible and effective for extracting the style of the product. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligent; design methodology; fuzzy logic; knowledge based systems; machine learning algorithms","Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Computational linguistics; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Artificial intelligent; Based on case-based reasoning; Design Methodology; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy case-based reasonings; Fuzzy nearest neighbor algorithm; Product characteristics; Similarity measurements; Fuzzy logic","Shi, F.; College of Information and Engineering, Wenzhou Medical UniversityChina; email: sfq@wmu.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018967900

The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA.org) is the professional association that serves as a bridge between the expertise area from which auditing skills are delivered and assessed and the areas in which information systems security is developed and delivered, effectively bridging the practices of accounting and IT Security. Individuals skilled in accounting, such as graduates from combined Accounting/Information Systems departments in business schools are naturally oriented to such industry groups and certifications, but the mainstream IT practice and literature is not. This panel will serve to brief IT Security researchers interested in the process of auditing on the values and procedures of the certification process with implications for understanding corporate IT Security performance as a function of auditing expertise represented at the highest levels of organizational decision making. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.
