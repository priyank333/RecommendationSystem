The critical issue in WSNs is represented by the limited availability of energy within the network and hence optimizing energy consumption is very important. One important existing technique used to prolong the network lifetime of WSN is the Energy Minimization Scheme (EMS) using N-Policy Model (NPM) based on queue threshold but this technique increases mean delay. This paper proposes a Modified Energy Minimization Scheme (MEMS) which reduces the mean delay and average energy consumption of individual nodes in the cluster based heterogeneous sensor network using queue threshold based on M/D/1 Priority Queueing Model (PQM) in order to prolong the network lifetime. The expression for the optimal value of queue threshold for which the node consumes minimum energy using PQM is also derived. Results show that the mean delay is highly reduced in PQM when compared to the NPM and the trade-off exist between the average energy consumption and mean delay is explored. We perform simulations and the results obtained show that the simulation results match with the analytical results thus validating the accuracy of the approach. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Energy; Mean delay; NPM; PQM; Queue threshold","Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Queueing theory; Sensor nodes; Analytical results; Communication infrastructure; Diverse locations; Energy; Energy minimization; Heterogeneous sensor networks; Mean delays; Queue threshold; Wireless sensor networks","Jayarajan, P.; Department of ECE, Sri Krishna College of TechnologyIndia; email: pjayarajan@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039544513

The term coverage is strongly correlated with the Lifetime of the network. Improving the network lifetime therefore enhances the sensing task of any network. The work takes up two techniques for improving the lifetime of the linear iterative regression based clustered network. As the energy of the cluster head drains below a threshold due to the traffic carried, the cluster member of the dead heading node can be allocated to some existing eligible cluster heads in the network so that the data sensed by these nodes can still be communicated to the sink. Alternately the allocation of secondary cluster head can be done for the aggregation of data which serves for improvement in lifetime of the network. With exhaustive simulation and evaluated results the performance of the two schemes are compared using throughput, Network lifetime and residual energy and it shows that the secondary cluster head allocation scheme is better in performance improvement of the network with the lifetime improvement of 22.8% and throughput improvement of 18.6% as compared to that of the cluster member allocation scheme. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Cluster head; Cluster member; Clustered network; Network coverage; Network lifetime; Residual energy; Throughput","Iterative methods; Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Throughput; Cluster head; Cluster member; Clustered networks; Network coverage; Network lifetime; Residual energy; Wireless sensor networks","Joshitha, K.L.; Sri Sairam Engineering CollegeIndia; email: lakshmijoshitha@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039556715

Due to the openness and mobility of such networks, even without knowing the context of the exchanged data or linking traffic to the identities of involved sensors, criminals are able to gain useful information about the severe conditions of patients and carry effective undetectable physical attacks. Therefore, confidentiality and mutual authentication services are essential for WBANs, and the transmission must be anonymous and unlinkable as well. Given the limitations of the resources available for these sensors, a lightweight anonymous mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for centralized two-hop WBANs is proposed in this paper, which allows sensor nodes attached to the patient's body to authenticate with the local server/hub node and establish a session key in an anonymous and unlinkable manner. The security of our scheme is proved by rigorous formal proof using BAN logic and also through informal analysis. Besides, the security of our scheme is evaluated by using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) as well. Finally, we compare our proposed scheme with other related schemes and the comparison results show that our scheme outperforms previously related schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anonymity; AVISPA; Healthcare; Mutual authentication; WBAN; Wearable sensors","Authentication; Health care; Network security; Patient monitoring; Sensor nodes; Wearable technology; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Anonymity; AVISPA; Internet security; Mutual authentication; Physical conditions; Sensitive informations; WBAN; Wireless body area network; Wearable sensors","Li, X.; School of Computer science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, 411201, China; email: lixiongzhq@163.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

Agriculture has to tackle many problems like changing climate, water shortage, changing soil quality, etc. Due to the increasing demand for cereals and other crops for daily usage by the consumers there is a need for smarter implementation of irrigation and also develop farming methods that alter the basic eco systems and is less harmful to other creatures. India is one of highest crop producing countries all over the world. At the same time, India is facing the challenge of farmers committing suicide because of crop failure and debt. Most of the land in India is still being used for agriculture purposes. Still there exists several places that uses very primitive methods for irrigation, fertilization etc. This leads to the reduction in the crop yield and eventually less income for the farmers. This paper discusses the design and development of an IoT framework that helps farmers to improvise their methods of farming and also make the best use of their land for a better yield and income. The major goal of this IoT framework is to sense agriculture characteristics and advice farmers to properly grow and treat the crops. The system deploys a group of wireless sensor networks nodes deployed in the field for sensing agricultural parameters and the RF communication of WSN node is used to transmit the measured data to base station. Base station is connected to a decision support system. Based on the sensed parameters and the optimum values, the decision support system will generate an appropriate message for farmers. By using the collected data from the sensors, the proposed system will provide suggestions about the monitoring crop such as irrigation timings, directions for optimum usage of fertilizers etc. in accordance to the farmers' lands. An android application has been designed to deliver the messages to farmers in their regional language. The android app also gives information regarding the weather forecast and precaution to be taken based on the weather forecast. © 2017 IEEE.","Agriculture; Automation; IoT; Precision Farming; Smart Irrigation; Wireless Sensor Networks","Agriculture; Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Automation; Base stations; Crops; Decision support systems; Internet of things; Irrigation; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Android applications; Changing climate; Design and Development; Iot frameworks; Optimum value; Precision farming; RF communication; Water shortages; Weather forecasting",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509060467,,,"English","GHTC - IEEE Glob.

It plays a vital role in the survival and existence of flora and fauna. But, now a days it is been exploited heavily by dumping of human waste, industrial and chemical waste in to the water bodies which is the resultant of water being contaminated with toxic chemicals. Water scarcity and water contamination has been one of the major issues faced by the society around the world. In many developing countries like India, the main focus is given to industrialization and urbanization. But this has caused an increased water usage and water contamination. This paper deals with the monitoring of water quality by mainly considering the physical and chemical properties of water. For this purpose, a Wireless Sensor node is designed which will contain several sensors to sense the chemical contents of water. The highlight of sensor node is that it is water proof. The main components of WSN include microcontroller for processing the system, communication system for inter and intra node communication and several sensors. The power for the sensor nodes are obtained from the solar panels connected to the sensor nodes. Though, in earlier times, there were water quality monitoring systems, they were power hungry and not real time. Apart from acting as a single system, if this system integrates with other innovative solutions like Smart Home or Smart Building, the application of this system would increase leading to an increased demand for it. This paper highlights on how a real time monitoring system can be made generic, using Network Virtualization. Also, new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) could be incorporated in this system to make it advanced. © 2017 IEEE.","Low cost; Quality Monitoring; Water Quality; WSN","Automation; Developing countries; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Real time systems; Sensor nodes; Water pollution; Water quality; Internet of Things (IOT); Intra-node communication; Low costs; Physical and chemical properties; Quality monitoring; Real time monitoring system; Water quality monitoring; Water quality monitoring systems; Monitoring",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509060467,,,"English","GHTC - IEEE Glob.

For these achievement of clustering techniques, optimization technique particle swarm optimization is used for data transmission through base station. If the base station is inaccessible region from the cluster-head, energy consumption will be augmented and it can shrink the lifetime of wireless sensor network. To conquer these, multi-hop gateway node is implemented with both protocol to achieve maximum lifetime and energy efficiency of wireless sensor network.

The routing path to the sink is established using Grid Heads. Grid Heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternatively. So, not all Grid Heads take part in the routing process at a time. This saves energy of Grid Heads and improves the network lifetime. The proposed method builds a routing path using each active Grid Head leading towards the sink.

Furthermore, the traditional MANC techniques are not scalable and computationally complex when the noise cancellation is desired in a wide area. With an objective to mitigate noise in such an environment, acoustic nodes equipped with ANC modules are deployed in the area. A robust distributed active noise control system (RDANC) is developed based on incremental cooperative learning among these sensor nodes and R-estimator based robust cost function.

In additions, sensors in such environment are energy constrained and generate the huge amount of data due to redundant data transmission and thus reducing lifetime of networks. Moreover, there is need to use efficient clustering techniques for collecting relevant data from nodes to eliminate redundancy. The data gathering using existing clustering algorithms engage some problems like arbitrary shape of clusters, estimating input parameters, detection of noisy points. In this paper, we propose an improved clustering method known as hybrid DB-EMGM that combines both EMGM and DBSCAN methods. The improved method aims to reduce the data traffic inside the WSNs network by minimizing intra cluster distance and, thus, finding location of cluster heads using calculated cluster covariance and mean when forming different clusters. The concept of mobile sink node is utilized for collecting the relevant data from all nodes by visiting every cluster heads. Since the mobility concept of node tries to reduce wireless data transmission by following the shortest path based on cluster heads location. The results of our method show that it is computationally faster than EMGM by reducing intra and inter cluster communication distance and increases the transmission rate to the sink node. The performance of our improved method is validated through results presented. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; clustering etc; DB-EMGM; DBSCAN; EMGM; Energy Efficient","Big data; Cluster analysis; Data acquisition; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes; clustering etc; DB-EMGM; DBSCAN; EMGM; Energy efficient; Clustering algorithms",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In a given sensing field, sensor nodes can often be grouped into non overlapping subsets called clusters. Gaussian distribution is preferably used for realistic applications and can provide a reduction in energy hole problem and enhance intrusion detection capability. In this research paper, we proposed the cluster size optimization for the Gaussian distributed sensor nodes, while, Base Station (BS) follows a Tunable Multilevel Sensing Model (TMSM). Using this model, we obtained an expression to find optimal clusters. Herein, the communication between Cluster Heads (CH) and Base Station (BS) is considered to be of single-hop mode. Subsequently, it has illustrated the effectiveness of proposed model in comparison with two contemporary models (a) Gaussian distribution of sensor nodes, where a BS follows a simple (classical) sensing model (GSS) (b) Uniform distribution of sensor nodes, where a BS follows the simple (classical) sensing model (USS).

Due to this limited battery energy of sensor nodes it becomes a challenge for WSN to maintain proper functioning for a long time. So for the enhancement in network lifetime of the WSN, here we propose a modified diagonal first (bypass) forwarding scheme. In our proposed bypass forwarding scheme, the sensing region is partitioned into a grid based virtual infrastructure and in each grid the sensors elect a grid-leader on the basis of their residual energy and the grid-leaders are responsible for data dissemination to the sink node in three ways (a) horizontal (b) vertical and (c) diagonal. In this paper, we propose a modified data dissemination algorithm for wireless sensor networks that reduces the number of intermediate nodes involved during the communication between source and sink. This eventually extends the lifetime of sensor network. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can extend the network lifetime up to 30 percent. © 2017 IEEE.","Bypass Forwarding; Data Dissemination; Sink; Source; WSN","Electric batteries; Information dissemination; Bypass Forwarding; Data dissemination; Data dissemination algorithms; Forwarding schemes; Limited battery energy; Sink; Source; Virtual infrastructures; Sensor nodes",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Secured and reliable routing in the WSN is the most arduous task which needs to be performed with more concern for the stable output. In the existing work clustering based symbiotic organism search method is used to share the data with assured reliability and packet delivery ratio. However, this approach lacks performance due to the intruder, and it is resolved in the proposed method by introducing the novel method namely hybridized pareto-glowworm swarm optimization and authenticated data communication. In this paper, cluster head selection is made by considering multiple quality of service parameters such mobility and energy whereas in the previous research only energy is considered. To select the optimal cluster head with multiple objectives, a pareto optimal method is hybridized with the GSO algorithm for the multi-objective fitness evaluation. Here formation of clusters is purely based on the selected cluster Head. After clustering, data is gathered from the multiple sensor nodes which are aggregated to reduce the bandwidth utilization and forwarded to the base station. To ensure the security level in this work authentication between the cluster head and the base station is done and then data is transmitted.

Due to this energy constraint, efficient routing protocol comes into picture. A sensor node senses the environment and generated the data. It sends the data to the sink with the help of nodes which are closer to the sink. Probability of depleting the energy of nodes near the sink increases and hence decreases the network lifetime. Mobile sink somehow solves this problem. In the proposed protocol, sensor nodes first get the updated position of the sink and then the data are directly sent to the sink. This protocol is rendezvous based routing protocol in which a rendezvous region is constructed in the middle of the network. This rendezvous region partitions the whole network area and distribute the network load among the sensor nodes which increases the network lifetime. Nodes inside this rendezvous region are divided into different clusters. Each cluster have one cluster head(CH) which is responsible for communication among different clusters. Sink sends its updated location information inside this rendezvous region, and when the sensor node wants to send the data it retrieves the sink's current location information from this rendezvous area and directly sends the data to the sink. © 2017 IEEE.","Area-Based Routing; Rendezvous area; Routing Protocol; Wireless sensor network","Internet protocols; Military applications; Network routing; Routing protocols; Temperature sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Area-based; Efficient routing; Energy constraint; Location information; Randomly distributed; Real-time application; Rendezvous area; Temperature sensing; Sensor nodes",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In multi-hop clustering, sensor nodes closer to the Base Station (BS) deplete their energy faster as compared to far away nodes. Transmission of own data as well as other nodes data by the nearer nodes is the prime cause for this uneven energy consumption. Hence, the nodes closer to the BS die quickly and network gets disconnected, though most of the nodes have adequate energy to communicate. This type of problem is known as hot spot problem in WSN. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop intra-cluster technique in uneven clustering, to minimizing the hot spot and intra-cluster communication problems. The BS divides the whole network into three types of unequal fixed square shaped Grids (clusters). In each cluster, the BS selects a Cluster Head (CH) based on number of hop or neighbour nodes and residual energy of the sensor nodes. Our proposed scheme uses both (centralized and distributed) methods for efficient routing in the network. Formation of all clusters and CH selection are performed centrally, whereas intra and inter-cluster communications are handled in a distributed manner. Here, uneven clusters help to minimize the hot spot problem in WSNs. In order to reduce the intra-cluster routing, we limit the forwarding packets maximum up to two hop in medium size and three hop in large size clusters. The BS checks residual energy of CH and its one hop child nodes after completion of every round. If either CH or one hop neighbours' residual energy is less than or equal to p fraction energy of the total energy, the BS station starts new CH selection process. By keeping intra-cluster communication distance minimum and avoiding rotation of CH in every round, this scheme saves significant amount of energy in WSN. The result obtained through simulation proves the superiority of our protocol in terms of residual energy, number of active nodes and network lifetime as compared to the existing protocols. Though, our protocol sustains upto more than 1000 rounds, proved that it has less hot spot as compared to other existing protocols. © 2017 IEEE.","Cluster head; hot spot; intra-cluster communication; Unequal cluster; Wireless sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster head; Clustering techniques; Energy efficient routing; Hot spot; Intercluster communication; Intra-cluster communication; Unequal cluster; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044229391

This paper presents the link quality, routing path issue built on depth based routing techniques to overcome the shortages in the existing work. Triangular metric based routing is a geometric combination of Packet Reception Probability(PRP), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Link Quality Indication (LQI) that is used to select the next forwarding node with reliability, which in turn reduces the routing cost. moreover it makes the very less energy consumption and improves the network lifetime. This method overcomes the unnecessary overlapping and repairs the link failure during network operation.

These devices are generally called as 'nodes' of the network. In wireless ad-hoc networks, nodes do not depend on any pre-existing infrastructure. In these communications depends on the capability of the nodes to make a multi-hop radio network. Security is a major concern in every communication system. Every node in the network must be authenticated for reliable communication. There are many authentication mechanism like attribute based signature, identity based signature etc. Most of these mechanisms are either insecure or complex. We have proposed a distributed mechanism for authentication of nodes in wireless sensor networks. Tokens are used for authentication of nodes. The sensor nodes are logically arranged in the form of binary tree with base station forming the root node. A token is generated by the parent node for its child node. Then this token is used further by the child nodes for mutual authentication of the sensor nodes. The proposed protocol is simple and secure.

Revealing of any information communicated is not desirable in any mission critical applications. There are methods to provide securities for these applications by implementing cryptographic methods. However due to their resource constraint nature, public-key cryptography is too expensive. Although, the use of symmetric key cryptography as an alternative in traditional WSN is a promising solution, it is not as versatile as asymmetric cryptography. Also, due to the tiny physical attributes of the Sensor Nodes (SNs) in WSNs, they are prone to physical attacks. In the context of WSNs, the physical attacks may range from destroying, lifting, replacing and adding new SNs. The work in this paper addresses the threats induced due to physical attacks and, further proposes a methodology to mitigate it.

The nodes are used to monitor environment by spatially distributing them and by interfacing with sensors. All acquired data is transmitted wirelessly to gateway which in turn can process it independently or can be connected to a host system which can collect, analyze, process and present data using some software. IOT is an physical object network. Objects can be vehicles, buildings, devices, switches, and other items. The network is embedded with electronics, sensors, and softwares. Network connectivity is enabled to allow these objects to collect/acquire data and process whole data as per application requirement [1]. In this paper we present a system to monitor environment of soil with the help of WSN. Various sensors are used and data is acquired from each of them. Attention is needed for a farmer to protect his field from different disasters caused either by human or by nature. Human effort is not sufficient and also very expensive to pay for a worker. Here we are using few sensors to monitor the farm those are temperature sensor, moisture sensor to check whether the field is dry or wet and a LDR to verify the lighting at that place.

Because of these increase in services, medical staff faces with more and more challenges. To improve the quality of patient's life, wireless technology allows doctors to monitor patient's health condition remotely and gives them timely health information reminder anywhere anytime. The recent advanced biomedical sensors technology (i.e. wearable sensor), low-power integrated circuit and wireless communications have allowed the implementation of low-cost, small size and efficient physiological wearable sensor nodes. In this paper the advanced system contains the sensor nodes such as heart rate sensor and temperature sensor; these are capable of sensing the analog biomedical signal. These signals are then processed by using Arduino board and the processed data is integrated before transmitting. The information is continuously sent to the server through Zigbee network. At the receiver side, the collected information is analysed by the doctor. If any abnormal condition found in patients health than immediately alert system comes into action. This is performed by sending a stored message to the respective doctors of particular patient using GSM module.

In this paper, we are going to present an experimental evaluation of energy efficiency which depends on parameters such as energy consumption, latency and dropped frame in a 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional scenario of 100 nodes WSN. So for computing the energy efficiency of WSN, we compare the mean energy consumption, average dropped frames and latency of nodes with respect to number of packets, positioning of nodes (dimension-wise) and type of modulation (MSK or OQPSK16).

Multipath routing helps in establishing multiple paths within source and destination, providing the probability of the data reaching the destination and by sending multiple copies through different paths. The reliability of the path is measured through a fuzzy mechanism with limited rules (FMLR) algorithm to assess how far the path with multiple parameters is reliable and selecting the optimal route between source and destination.

This has become possible due to the technological advancements in which high computing and communication facilities are available for most of the modern handheld devices. In this environment, computing resources are available close to the proximity of the end users using the most popular technology called as Fog computing (devices used in the fog computing are called as fog devices). Most of the solutions reported in the literature for this purpose have used the traditional cloud-based infrastructure in which there may occur a long delay for getting the response even for data which is not of very huge amount which may cause a performance degradation for most of the implemented solutions (such as for treatment of neurological diseases where a real-time monitoring is required) in this environment. Hence, to cope up these issues, in this paper, we proposed a fog computing based patient monitoring system for ambient assisted living (FAAL). Data traces of the movement of the patients (for neurological diseases) are collected using sensor nodes using body area networks (BANs) and are passed using the fog gateways. To reduce the load on the communication infrastructure, an efficient clustering algorithm for data transmission is also presented in the paper. Performance of the proposed solution has been evaluated using the parameters such as-latency, and data overloading. Results obtained clearly show the superior performance of the proposed scheme as compared to the non-fog computing based environment. © 2017 IEEE.","Ambient Assisted living; Fog Computing; Wireless Body Area Sensor Network","Assisted living; Body sensor networks; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Fog; Neurology; Patient monitoring; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Ambient assisted living; Communication facilities; Communication infrastructure; Patient monitoring systems; Performance degradation; Technological advancement; Wireless body area network; Wireless body area sensor network; Fog computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509067046,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Time synchronization is the most fundamental and most important challenge faced by WSNs. Time Synchronization in WSN can be achieved either by gaining consensus amongst all the nodes or by a reference node which broadcasts a single unit of time to the entire network. The paper describes a novel technique to achieve fully distributed cluster clock synchronization, which synchronizes all the nodes in the network to a common consensus value. The algorithm employs clustering and confidence weighted running average (CWA) method for offset and skew compensations. The efficiency of protocol is validated with simulation results presented in the paper. © 2017 IEEE.","clock offset; consensus; convergence; time synchronization; wireless sensor network","Clocks; Clustering algorithms; Sensor nodes; Synchronization; Clock offset; Clock Synchronization; Clustering in wireless sensor networks; consensus; convergence; Distributed clusters; Time synchronization; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

But due to the constrained of resources and limited battery supply of sensor nodes, this becomes the major areas of research. Earlier the LEACH protocol proposed contributes a lot in terms of reducing energy consumption among sensor nodes. Later on concept of rendezvous nodes (RZ) and mobile sink was combined with LEACH to reduce energy consumption. In order to contribute more toward this direction Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been added to find the optimized route. The proposed work uses the concept of Neural Network (i.e. in the selection process of cluster heads) and Hybrid ACO/PSO technique (finds the shortest route) in optimizing the network lifetime and to improve energy efficiency.

LDN comprises of several such sensor nodes distributed in a certain geographical area which captures lightning signals. The single sensor node system consists of the antenna, analog circuit front end, and digital back end. These sensor nodes then transmit lightning data in real time to central lightning location system (CLLS) which calculates the exact location of the lightning stroke. We have designed and implement cost effective digital back-end system for a sensor node which digitizes analog signals and performs some signal processing in the digital domain before sending the data to CLLS. Analog front-end receives and amplifies lightning very low frequency signal (VLF) signals, then presented digital system samples the analog signals at a rate of 1 Mega samples per second. This is followed by digital filtering and digital down conversion; after which the data samples are time-stamped with the corresponding real time (UTC time) then this data is sent to CLLS by UART link.

The flow control loops often employ pneumatic control valves as the final control element. These control valves suffer from various nonlinearities and stiction is most common of these. Due to stiction effect in the pneumatic control valves, the commonly used proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller introduces limit cycles in the flow control loops, which essentially deteriorates the productivity of the industrial environment. To curb such non sinusoidal oscillations in these control loops, recently two novel controllers have been proposed namely, Stiction Combating Intelligent Controller (SCIC) and Nonlinear Proportional Integral Controller (NPIC). These two controllers have been earlier thoroughly evaluated for flow control studies and are claimed to be very efficient for curbing the limit cycle behavior in the control loops. However, a comparative study between them is missing for the same, which would fill the void existing at present. This paper addresses the same issue and a comparative study between the two controllers is performed and presented in this paper for the setpoint tracking, disturbance rejection and parametric uncertainty problems. © 2017 IEEE.","controller tuning; flow control; intelligent control; limit cycle; pneumatic control valve; stiction","Closed loop control systems; Control nonlinearities; Disturbance rejection; Flow control; Intelligent control; Pneumatic control; Pneumatic control equipment; Pneumatics; Proportional control systems; Safety valves; Stiction; Two term control systems; Controller tuning; Industrial environments; Intelligent controllers; Limit-cycle; Nonlinear proportional integral; Parametric uncertainties; Process control industry; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

Unlike common networks the WSNs have the capability of reconfiguration, whenever any defect occurs in the network. However, while routing in these network the loss of data is occurring due to its security lack. Hence many researchers have presented their research for providing secure routing in WSNs. The security is still an issue in routing of WSNs. In this paper, we have developed a novel protocol for the secure routing of WSNs, and named as Trust-Distrust Protocol (TDP). The proposed protocol has four stages, initial stage is topology management, where an improved k-means algorithm is applied. Then the second stage is Link Quality Appraisal, which means fitness evaluation of every nodes in the network. The third stage is Grading, in which based on the fitness value a grade point is allotted to every node. In the last stage the secure path for the routing is determined based on grade point. The proposed TDP is tested in NS2 and the performance is compared with the existing LEACH protocol.

Owing to the cost constraints, only a limited amount of nodes in the network can know their locations by a variety of positioning mechanisms such as GPS or manual setup mechanism. These nodes are commonly called as anchor nodes, where as other nodes with unknown location information are called non-anchor nodes or static sensor nodes. Anchor nodes are positioned by employing RSS measurements in this proposed method. It plays a major role in the intermediate processing so as to get accurate position of the static sensor nodes. Hence the signals from anchors, used for computation should be accurate as well. Just because RSS is concerned, the deployment of the anchors is a vital issue. To reduce the cost factor the numbers of them has to be optimized. This paper suggests an algorithm for the above purpose. © 2017 IEEE.","Optimization; Positioning; Received Signal Strength; Wireless Sensor Networks","Optimization; Wireless sensor networks; Anchor nodes; Cost constraints; Cost factors; Location information; Manual setups; Positioning; Received signal strength; Static sensor nodes; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033782,,,"English","Int.

This study deals in analysing the various lapses in security and the characteristics of various routing protocol's functionality and structure. This paper presents the implementation of ECC algorithm in the prevention of Denial of Service (DoS) attack through fictitious node. Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol is a MANET routing protocol and is evaluated mainly for two things. Primarily OLSR is less secure like AODV and others. The reason for it being less secure is that it is a table-driven in nature and uses a methodology called selective flooding technique, where redundancy is reduced and thus the security possibilities of the protocol is reduced. Another reason for selecting OLSR is that is an highly effective routing protocol for MANET. A brief information about formal routing is provided by the proposed methodology termed Denial Contradictions with Fictitious Node Mechanism (DCFM) which provides brief information about formal routing. Here, fictitious node acts as a virtual node and large networks are managed from attacks. More than 95% of attacks are prevented by this proposed methodology and the solution is applicable all the other DoS attacks of MANET. © 2017 IEEE.","DoS; ECC Algorithm; MANET; Network Layer Attacks; OLSR","Denial-of-service attack; DOS; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network layers; Network security; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Denial of Service; ECC algorithms; MANET; MANET routing protocols; Network layer attacks; OLSR; Optimized Link State Routing; Selective flooding; Mobile security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033782,,,"English","Int.

In this network, minimizing the battery consumption is most enormous challenge. For reliable data transmission, effective routing is required. In this work, an efficient node infirmity tracking scheme with stable supportive route for reliable data transmission is proposed. Problem Statement: Sensor nodes sense the data and forwards to CH. If there is any failure of edge node occurs then it needs to send the packet again. Retransmission of data causes overload in network. The proposed work concentrates on these issues. It consists of four phases: The first phase includes link establishment. In second phase, edge node failure is detected. In third phase, the disability of nodes is identified by using Infirmity Tracking Scheme (ITS). Finally in last phase, Stable Supportive Path Routing Algorithm (SSPRA) is used to find the supportive path in network if any failure of path occurs. It maintains the progression of data transmission and link stability. Outcome: It results minimized consumption of energy and balance load in network. Simulation is carried out and found it achieves better performance than existing algorithms in comparing metrics connectivity ratio, end to end delay, overhead, throughput and packet delivery ratio. © 2017 IEEE.","Edge node failure; Node Infirmity Tracking Scheme; Stable Supportive Path Routing Algorithm","Data transfer; Battery consumption; Consumption of energy; Edge nodes; End to end delay; Packet delivery ratio; Problem statement; Reliable data transmission; Tracking scheme; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033782,,,"English","Int.

Low-priced sensor nodes are used to form the WSN and are kept distributed in a dense manner in the environment. Collecting information and forwarding it to a Base Station (BS) is the chief function of a sensor node. New trends show that the importance and relevance of WSNs has widened and improved significantly. The biggest disadvantage of such type of network is its limited energy resources. To improve the lifetime of these networks a suitable method namely clustering is used which saves energy thus protecting the limited sensor resources. Meta-heuristic algorithms are popularly used for clustering of WSNs. In more complex problems calculating a huge amount of possible modes is carried out to find the most precise answer.

Existing security protocols exploit various cryptographic tools to strengthen their security. Not many works focus on constraints faced by an adversary. One such constraint being practical difficulties to trace a particular frequency band from a large range of unknown frequencies, specially in unharmonious geographical locations. Our research capitalizes on this weakness encountered by an adversary and preassigns nodes with multiple frequency bands from a wide range of frequencies allocated to the network. Deployed nodes can discover these bands during set network setup phase by a simple trick. Nodes are to internally switch their frequency bands depending on parametric variation that are caused by an (external) impulse. Experiments conducted using magneto optic sensors confirm that any variation of their parameter affects frequencies of emergent waves. Similar behavior is expected from application specific sensors. Frequency regulation (FR) concept is applied to combinatorial key predistribution schemes (KPS) having (regular) degree r. Depending on r and each node's capability to switch internal frequencies, nodes are preallocated with n frequency bands. This naturally partitions the (distributed) network and results in improved resilience. Combining our FR concept to a KPS where the number of shared key between a pair of nodes is at most one (γ ≤ 1) may yield best case scenario of an ideally resilient key predistribution. Our analysis of systems that combines FR idea with KPS where γ > 1 leads to an optimized key-band distribution argument and drastic resilience improvements. Results of simulations conducted assuming real-life scenario ascertain our analysis and establishes superior performance of our protocols as compared to prominent ones.

However, we reveal previously unpublished vulnerabilities in their scheme, which allow an attacker to carry out sensor node spoofing, password guessing, user/sensor node anonymity, and user impersonation attacks.

With increase in population and usage of RTS, safety measures are concerned to be most notable factor in the world. Moreover, during emergency cases internal wired safety setups of any RTS does not prevents drastic disaster and allows negative impact for on-demand reliable changes. As an alternative to other expensive technologies, wireless sensor network (WSN) system provides fast communicative and compact applications to RTS. Inorder to reduce causalities, designing such a network application to RTS always poses challenging problems in terms of fault tolerance and time bounded packet delivery. Integrated fuzzy-logic based synchronized data transmission (IFSDT) algorithm has been designed to optimize those challenges, especially in RTS. IFSDT is a synchronized energy aware algorithm that prevents the occurrence of potential faults during unexpected emergencies in the coaches of RTS and ensures the fast transmission of critical broadcast signal and response in a limited time span.

Both the nodes in the network and the jammer are capable of switching frequencies. Existing literature mostly thrive on mechanisms with a mutually pre-decided hopping-sequence or on random frequency-hopping techniques. However, these mechanisms often fall short in the context of energy-constrained WSNs. We propose a frequency-hopping strategy based on the optimal decision rule. The proposed solution takes into account the individual decision profiles of all the concerned nodes, and finally, makes the decision for the welfare of the overall network. The objective is to find an optimal frequency hopping rule to obtain the maximum throughput. We observe that the packet delivery ratio of the network improves by approximately 30% after the application of the optimal decision rule for frequency-hopping. The overall network energy consumption is also improved by approximately 53% by the application of the proposed solution approach, as observed from the results. © 2017","Frequency hopping; Jamming avoidance; Optimal decision rule; Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Energy utilization; Frequency hopping; Jamming; Sensor nodes; Energy-constrained; Hopping sequences; Maximum through-put; Optimal decision-rule; Optimal frequency; Packet delivery ratio; Random frequency hopping; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Misra, S.; School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal - 721302, India; email: smisra@sit.iitkgp.ernet.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

In a network node, each sensor has several parts such as transceiver with an internal or connection to an external antenna, micro controller, electronic circuits for interfacing sensors and energy source. The scaling of single node cluster has a limitation of CPU computational powers, maximum memory and number of processes that can run on a single machine. In order to overcome these limitations multi node clusters are needed. To process huge amount of data at the same timeframe, multi node clusters are used. To monitor environment and physical conditions such as temperature, ambient light etc. and to cooperatively pass their data through network to a main location a distributed autonomous sensor called Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are used.

The wireless sensor communication network is one of the major components of the critical infrastructure in all networked systems including networked control systems and CPSs. As these systems support range of time and data sensitive applications, varying from health care to emergency services, to transport, and to environmental monitoring services, core sensor network component faces potential threats due to varying attacks, including wormhole attack that can cause damage to the control system in terms of data leakage, data dropping, and delayed delivery. It is also difficult to detect, as it requires neither nodes in the network to be compromised nor adversaries to acquire valid network identity to instigate such attacks. Many existing solutions in the literature to detect wormholes are based on node's static location information, synchronization of clocks, use of additional hardware, such as antennas and GPS, and neighborhood and traffic information, which may lead to large energy consumption. In this paper, a scalable and distributed scheme which uses sequential probability ratio test is proposed, to avoid single point failures and to handle high mobility, with no additional resource requirements. It is observed that wormholes are detected using few packets and detection is faster with increasing mobility. The system is highly customizable as system parameters can be chosen to balance the speed and accuracy of detection. System overheads in terms of communication, computation, and storage aspects are analyzed and presented. © 2013 IEEE.","Cyber physical systems; networked control systems; security; sequential analysis; wireless sensor networks; wormhole attacks","Computer crime; Control system analysis; Control systems; Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Emergency services; Energy utilization; Health risks; Networked control systems; Sensor nodes; Distributed detection; Environmental Monitoring; security; Sensitive application; Sequential analysis; Sequential probability ratio test; Wireless sensor communication; Wormhole attack; Wireless sensor networks","Padmanabhan, J.; Department of Computer Technology, Madras Institute of Technology Campus, Anna UniversityIndia; email: pjshree12@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038398339

There is a high possibility that these existing methods will encounter more challenges and issues in relation to network dynamics, resulting in a high overhead in the network response time, leading to latency and traffic. In order to avoid these problems in the network and achieve an optimum level of resource utilization, a new paradigm called edge computing (EC) is proposed to pave the way for the evolution of new age applications and services. With the integration of EC, the processing capabilities are pushed to the edge of network devices such as smart phones, sensor nodes, wearables, and on-board units, where data analytics and knowledge generation are performed which removes the necessity for a centralized system. Many IoT applications, such as smart cities, the smart grid, smart traffic lights, and smart vehicles, are rapidly upgrading their applications with EC, significantly improving response time as well as conserving network resources. Irrespective of the fact that EC shifts the workload from a centralized cloud to the edge, the analogy between EC and the cloud pertaining to factors such as resource management and computation optimization are still open to research studies. Hence, this paper aims to validate the efficiency and resourcefulness of EC. We extensively survey the edge systems and present a comparative study of cloud computing systems. After analyzing the different network properties in the system, the results show that EC systems perform better than cloud computing systems.

This results in high energy dissipation of the devices. Thus, balancing of energy consumption is a major concern in such kind of network. Appropriate cluster head (CH) selection may provide to be an efficient way to reduce the energy dissipation and prolonging the network lifetime in WSN. This paper has adopted the concept of fuzzy if-then rules to choose the cluster head based on certain fuzzy descriptors. To optimise the fuzzy membership functions, particle swarm optimisation has been used to improve their ranges. Moreover, recent study has confirmed that the introduction of a mobile collector in a network which collects data through short-range communications also aids in high energy conservation. In this work, the network is divided into clusters and a mobile collector starts from the static sink or base station and moves through each of these clusters and collect data from the chosen cluster heads in a single-hop fashion. Mobility based on ant-colony optimisation has already proven to be an efficient method which is utilised in this work. Additionally, instead of performing clustering in every round, CH is selected on demand. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with some existing clustering algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol is more energy-efficient and provides better packet delivery ratio as compared to the existing protocols for data collection obtained through Matlab simulations. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Ant colony optimisation; Clustering; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimisation; Wireless sensor network","Ant colony optimization; Clustering algorithms; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Dust collectors; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; MATLAB; Membership functions; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; Clustering; Fuzzy if-then rules; Fuzzy membership function; Mobile data collections; Multi hop communication; Packet delivery ratio; Particle swarm optimisation; Short-range communication; Wireless sensor networks","Ghosh, N.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: ghosh.nimisha@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035803837

Clustering in WSNs significantly reduces the energy consumption in which the nodes are organized in clusters, each having a cluster head (CH). The CHs collect data from their cluster members and transmit it to the base station via a single or multihop communication. The main issue in such mechanism is how to associate the nodes to CHs and how to route the data of CHs so that the overall load on CHs are balanced. Since the sensor nodes operate autonomously, the methods designed for WSNs should be of distributed nature, i.e., each node should run it using its local information only. Considering these issues, we propose a distributed multiobjective-based clustering method to assign a sensor node to appropriate CH so that the load is balanced. We also propose an energy-efficient routing algorithm to balance the relay load among the CHs. In case any CH dies, we propose a recovery strategy for its cluster members. All our proposed methods are completely distributed in nature. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption and hence prolonging the network lifetime. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with some existing algorithms in terms of number of alive nodes, network lifetime, energy efficiency, and energy population.

The constant monitoring of critical scenarios has make WSNs an attractive choice for researchers at a large scale. The main objective is to increase the network lifetime for optimal and efficient utilization of resources in WSNs. For optimum functionality, various approaches have been proposed based upon clustering. Network lifetime is related with energy level of sensor nodes deployed in region of interest. As sensor nodes have limited lifetime, so there is a need to develop an algorithm for aggregating the sensors data in WSNs. A novel Dynamic Adaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation (DAHDA) algorithm has been presented for evolving, uniform and non-uniform networks while maintaining the data accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to handle sudden bursts in the underlying data by recording the data in the area of interest for the whole event duration. The experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data shows that the algorithm performs well in terms of extending the lifetime of the network, maintaining the original distribution of the sensors as long as possible and maintaining the accuracy of the sensed data. DAHDA is an adaptive hierarchical aggregation algorithm for WSNs. The proposed algorithm has been simulated and its performance has been compared with the existing approaches in terms of residual energy, number of alive nodes, data accuracy, sudden burst detection, sensor distribution, lifetime of last node, first node and average lifetime of node for uniform, non-uniform and evolving networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Data aggregation; Density based clustering; Hierarchical routing; Network lifetime; Non-uniform networks; Wireless Sensor Networks","Image segmentation; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Data aggregation; Density-based Clustering; Hierarchical routings; Network lifetime; Non-uniform; Wireless sensor networks","Randhawa, S.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: sukhchandan@thapar.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027501575

However, the significance of small world characteristics in wireless sensor network (WSN) applications has hitherto not been investigated. This work investigates the significance of introducing small world characteristics in a conventional WSN for improving the node localization accuracy. In this context, a novel constrained iterative average path length reduction algorithm is proposed to introduce small world characteristics into a conventional WSN. This method utilizes a novel frequency selective approach for the introduction of small world phenomena. The frequency selective approach utilizes two frequency bands for link addition and pruning to create an optimized small world WSN. Subsequently, a constrained least squares node localization method over the small world WSN is developed using both model-based and model-free signal propagation approaches. The proposed constrained iterative average path length reduction method provides reduced average path length and a high average clustering coefficient when compared to conventional WSN. Constrained least squares node localization over the small world WSN yields improved localization performance when compared to node localization over conventional WSN. Performance analysis in terms of localization error, power consumption, bandwidth and anchors required for node localization is also discussed. Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis for node location parameters is also used to provide insights into the error bounds obtained using the proposed method.

The data collected from the WSN is used for making decisions. The condition for making critical decision is to assure the trustworthiness of the data generated from sensor nodes. However, the approaches for scoring the sensed data alone is not enough in WSN since there is an interdependency between node and data item. If the overall trust score of the network is based on one trust component, then the network might be misguided. In this work, we propose the hybrid approach to address the issue by assigning the trust score to data items and sensor nodes based on data quality and communication trust respectively. The proposed hybrid trust management scheme (HTMS) detects the data fault with the help of temporal and spatial correlations. The correlation metric and provenance data are used to score the sensed data. The data trust score is utilized for making decision. The communication trust and provenance data are used to evaluate the trust score of intermediate nodes and source node. If the data item is reliable enough to make critical decisions, a reward is given by means of adding trust score to the intermediate nodes and source node. A punishment is given by reducing the trust score of the source and intermediate nodes, if the data item is not reliable enough to make critical decisions. Result shows that the proposed HTMS detects the malicious, faulty, selfish node and untrustworthy data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Data trustworthiness; Trust management; Wireless sensor networks","Decision making; Wireless sensor networks; Continuous observation; Data trustworthiness; Environmental conditions; Hybrid approach; Intermediate node; Making decision; Temporal and spatial correlation; Trust management; Sensor nodes","Karthik, N.; Department of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: nkarthikapce@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028564042

When a target enters in a monitoring region and moves around it, the deployed WSN is used to collect information about the target and send it to the nearby base station. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy based target tracking algorithm (CTFTT). The algorithm constructs a convoy tree around the target and dynamically moves the tree along with the target by adding new nodes into the tree and removing old nodes from the tree. The expansion, contraction and reconfiguration of the tree is done using a fuzzy based sensing model. Important advantages are (1) convoy tree provides 100% coverage, (2) fuzzy mechanism helps to localize the evevts such as tree expansion, contraction and reconfiguration. This in turn helps to reduce the energy consumption in the network. Localized events also reduce communication overhead. Thus CTFTT is able to support the tracking of even fast moving objects.

The wireless sensor nodes in sensor network are powered using rechargeable batteries. However, providing energy to nodes in the remote environment is a major issue in WSN. Hence WSN needs a new energy efficient algorithm to enhance the network lifetime. In a sensor node, the transceiving module consumes more energy when compared to other modules. In this paper, a Battery Recovery based Lifetime Enhancement (BRLE) algorithm is discussed, which considers battery voltage curve for scheduling the transceiving module of the sensor nodes. The Markov model helps in determining the state of the sensor node as CH and CM based on battery recovery process. By scheduling the transceiving module based on the battery terminal voltage, recovery factor and distance between the nodes, the lifetime of the network is enhanced. Experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms the others by 1.38 times increased lifetime and 1.574 times increased throughput. The BRLE decreases the HOT SPOT and energy hole problem, avoiding loss in connectivity with the sink. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Energy efficient; Energy management policy; Hot spot; Recovery effect; Voronoi; Wireless sensor network","Computer system recovery; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Markov processes; Recovery; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Sensor nodes; Energy efficient; Energy-hole problems; Hot spot; Lifetime enhancement; Recovery effects; Remote environment; Voronoi; Wireless sensor node; Wireless sensor networks","Mahima, V.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Krishna College of Technology, Kovaipudur, India; email: mahi.90may@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027862610

However, MANETs are more suspicious to various malicious activates and unauthorized access. In order to overcome this issue, we have proposed a cluster based certificate revocation method to isolate the malicious node and prevent the unauthorized access. The proposed algorithm effectively used to solve security issues in MANET. The proposed framework is demonstrated as following blocks, namely, cluster construction, cluster head selection, certificate authority, node classification, certificate revocation and evaluation of false accusations. Especially, we have proposed ECMS algorithm for identifying the best cluster head in each cluster. The ECMS algorithm is stands for energy (E), connectivity (C), mobility (M) and signal to noise ratio (S). The sensor nodes present in the network are classified into three types, namely, normal node, warned node, and revoked node. In certificate revocation procedure, every node present in the network is monitored with the help of one-hop neighbours. These neighbours are also used to collect the malicious information about the sensor nodes. If any node is wrongly identified as a malicious node then its legitimate nodes send the vindication packets (VPs) to the appropriate gateways to correct the mistake. The performance of the proposed cluster based certificate revocation method is evaluated on the basis of various parameters it includes successful certification ratio (SSR), settling time (ST), average certification delay (ACD), packet delivery ratio, normalized overhead (NRO), end-to-end delay and throughput. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the trust based algorithm, non-voting based algorithm and voting based algorithm.

A cantilever based piezoelectric energy harvester acts as a spring mass damper system having a resonance frequency tuned with ambient vibrations of low frequency. Maximum potential is generated when the resonance frequency of the energy harvester matches with frequency of ambient vibration. The highlight of this paper is a pyramidal shape seismic mass which results in a higher generated potential as compared to the square shaped seismic mass. This pyramidal shape is realized using tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide CMOS compatible 25 wt% wet etching. Two beam and four beam structures are front released using deep reactive ion etching which are fixed from both ends and having pyramidal shape seismic mass at the center. This paper presents a comparison of guided four beam and two beam cantilever type piezoelectric energy harvester fabricated using MEMS technology using a laser doppler vibrometer (LDV). Experimentally using LDV the resonance frequency for the fabricated guided two beam cantilever structure resonance frequency is 1971.9 Hz and for the guided four beam cantilever structure is 2540.6 Hz. Bandwidth for two beam cantilever structure is 40.6 Hz whereas for four beam cantilever structure bandwidth comes as 101.9 Hz.

A number of range-based and range-free localization algorithms have been proposed in last two decades. Range-based schemes attain higher localization accuracy at the cost of extra ranging hardware whereas; range-free schemes are cost effective but show poor localization accuracy. In order to improve the localization accuracy, we have proposed dynamic range normal bisector (DRNB) algorithm which is a distributed range-free localization approach. In DRNB, connectivity between nodes, dynamic ranges of anchor nodes, and principle of normal bisector are used to determine the location of nodes. Each anchor node transmits beacon packets at two different range levels in the network. Each normal node estimates its location by calculating the centre point of the overlapping region of the communication ranges of neighbouring anchors where it lies. Normal bisector technique is used to find the centre point of this overlapping region. Sometimes estimated location of a node may fall out of this overlapping region. To overcome this problem, correction factor has also been proposed. DRNB is an energy efficient algorithm, as it doesn’t require the exchange of information between neighbouring nodes. Analysis and simulation results show that DRNB performs better compared to other existing range-free schemes (e.g. centroid, restricted area based localization and mid-perpendicular algorithm). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Correction factor; Dynamic anchor range; Normal bisector technique; Range-free localization; WSN","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Location; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Correction factors; Energy efficient algorithms; Exchange of information; Localization algorithm; Normal bisector technique; Range free localization; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Sharma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, CVR College of EngineeringIndia; email: ergaurav209@yahoo.co.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026800270

Simulations and real field wireless sensor node deployments are then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

To make clustering more efficient, fuzzy clusters can be used to ensure faster cluster formation and reliable data delivery. A wireless sensor network such as MANETs can then have an extended lifetime with the workload being distributed evenly. This paper proposes a competent fuzzy approach in cluster formation. The proposed approach has two significant stages, one which helps in the formation of fuzzy clusters and the other introduces a 3-level filtering technique. The former makes MANETs efficient and manageable and the latter helps in identifying trusted nodes for communication. The modified Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is entrusted with the task of assigning membership to each and every data point linked to each singular cluster center used in the formation of clusters, while a special filter scheme is used to distinguish between the trusted nodes and the malicious nodes. This helps is determining the identity and authenticity of the cluster members’. Eventually only the trusted nodes will be part of the communication range. The filter based fuzzy clustering approach can be used to determine the perfect nodes, which will reflect in the network performance.

Every node is able to observe the substantial surroundings and send it to the sink either in single hop or multihop fashion. In the network, the nodes which is nearer to the sink will lose their liveliness soon. Clustering is a key method for reducing the power utilization and also the life time of the network is increased at the same time. In this method, entire network is separated as a set of clusters. Each cluster consists of one cluster head (CH) and non cluster member nodes from each cluster will transfer the sensed data to the CH.

A group key management scheme should satisfy backward secrecy and forward secrecy security requirements in case of sensor revocation and new sensor join respectively. All the existing schemes are analyzed for their security under passive attack model. However, active outsider adversary model in which as adversary is allowed to compromise the legitimate sensor of the group is a strong model. In this work, we show that the key management schemes for wireless sensor networks based on bivariate polynomials, exclusive basis systems, key tree etc are not secure against active outsider model. In particular, we show that an outside adversary by compromising the legitimate sensor could obtain access not only to the current session group key but also the past group keys. Adversary can get the past keys despite the fact that the sensor nodes have erased the past group keys. To secure them against active adversary all the keys should be updated for every rekeying event which incurs additional cost of computation and communication for managing keys. We also give the methods to secure the schemes under active outsider adversary model. © 2017 IEEE.","Active outsider; Key management; Strong security; Wireless sensor networks","Polynomial approximation; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Active outsider; Bivariate polynomials; Group communications; Group key management; Key management; Key management schemes; Security requirements; Strong securities; Network security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Adoption of mobile charger in the wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) makes it easier to charge sensor nodes rather than charging with energy harvesting schemes. However, many existing energy replenishment schemes do not adapt to the scenarios in which there are uneven distribution of charging requests with temporal and spatial constraints. As a result, sensor nodes get starved due to ill-timed response of mobile charger and thus network performance is degraded.

These low power sensor nodes consume energy for data routing to destination i.e., sink. Sensor node dies once it all energy is exhausted. This creates an unstable network. Hence, it is a key challenging task to increase the stability period of the network i.e., the time interval before the first node is dead. To address this key problem, in this paper a novel evolutionary based routing algorithm named Green Stable Evolutionary Routing Algorithm (GSERA) is proposed. This algorithm aims at prolonging the stability period. This in response improves the energy efficiency and reliability of the WSNs.

In many scenarios, the coverage area of the WSN will be very large and a multi-hop adhoc network needs to be maintained for the connectivity and data transfer among the nodes. The major part of the energy consumption of each node is used for data transfer among nodes. This paper proposes a energy efficient routing scheme. The scenario which is considered is a wireless sensor network which is a collection of clusters and data transfer happens with the help of cluster head (CH) rather than the collective effort of every node in the network. In such a cluster based WSN, it is advantageous to have a routing protocol which uses the information about clusters to decide upon route formation. This paper proposes a novel Cluster Based Routing Protocol for a WSN which optimizes the energy consumption on data transfer and thus increasing the lifetime of the WSN network. To conclude the advantages of the proposed scheme, comparison is carried out between the performance of AODV and CBRP protocols. © 2017 IEEE.","Cluster Based WSN; Data Aggregation; Data Transmission; Energy Efficiency; On Demand Routing; Routing Protocols; Wireless Sensor Networks","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Patient monitoring; Power management (telecommunication); Remote patient monitoring; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Structural health monitoring; Virtual reality; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster-based; Data aggregation; Disaster management; Energy efficient routing; On demand routing protocols; On-demand routing; Search and rescue operations; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Due to the use of random deployment strategy in such areas, the load must be balanced equally among the sensor nodes for efficient utilization of energy and extending the network life time. Hence, an efficient load balancing algorithm is proposed for grid-based clustering where merging and splitting of clusters is devised for sparse and dense clusters respectively and cross clustering is applied for averagely dense clusters. We have used multi-hop communication among the Cluster Heads (CHs) which reduces the energy consumption as well. The decision of cluster members to join adjoining cluster depends on its distance from both its current CH and adjoining CH. Thus communication of data, that requires the highest amount of energy, will be done for a short distance. Hence, the amount of energy spent by cluster members in communicating is also reduced. The overhead comparison with an existing algorithm depicts that the proposed algorithm being centralized in nature generates asymptotically the same amount of control packets as a distributed approach does. Our algorithm can perform better in terms of energy consumption and load balancing which eventually increases the network lifetime and minimizes creation of energy holes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cluster; Cluster Head; Energy Efficient; Grid; Load Balance; Wireless Sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Cluster head; Energy efficient; Grid; Load balance; Clustering algorithms",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353243,,,"English","ACM Int.

At first the concept of Voronoi diagram is utilized to divide the large scale monitoring area into small clusters in order to ensure maximum coverage and then the CH is selected in two stages.

As the application areas of the WSN are increasing at the same rate the security threats are also increasing. Intruders are applying various mechanisms to access the sensible and confidential data from sensors. Hence, strong security measures are much needed to immune WSNs from various attacks. Authentication is a security mechanism that protects WSNs from wide range of security attacks. In this paper, an authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is based on tokens. Any node when deployed in WSN is embedded with base station's public key and through the corresponding cluster head; it requests and acquires its token for authentication from the base station. The generated token is light in weight and reduces much of computational, communicational and storage overheads. The proposed protocol is verified for its security both formally and automatically.

Real processes often exhibit nonlinear behavior. Many process industries use conical tanks because its shape contributes to better drainage. Its non-linearity due to the constantly changing cross section makes the control of a conical tank a challenging problem. In order to improve the control effectiveness of some nonlinear processes, a novel Nonlinear Guided Intelligent Controller (NGIC) inspired by the bio-cooperative regulation mechanism and the regulation characteristics of glucose in human body is developed. The Nonlinear Guided Intelligent Controller comprises of an Enhanced Control Unit (ECU), an Inhibitory Control Unit (ICU), an Auxiliary Control Unit (ACU) and a Cooperative Control Unit (CCU). To shorten the rise time of the process variable, the ECU takes effect first with a rapid step action when the set-point changes or a large error appears. After a prescribed time, to reduce the system overshoot or to avoid oscillations, the ICU takes effect with an opposite step action. Once the steady state is obtained, in order to improve the control precision of the Nonlinear Guided Intelligent Controller, the ACU becomes effective by applying a central proportional law with a guided final control output. As a super managing unit, the CCU coordinates the working of the ECU, ICU and ACU to make the Nonlinear Guided Intelligent Controller eliminate the control error thereby giving short rise time and settling time as well as less overshoot. Nonlinear Guided Intelligent Controller is used to control the level of water in a conical tank which is a non-linear process. The model of the process is identified using standard step response based system identification and by mathematical modelling. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Control systems; Controllers; Intelligent control; Intensive care units; Tanks (containers); Auxiliary control; Changing cross section; Co-operative control; Control effectiveness; Cooperative regulation; Intelligent controllers; Nonlinear behavior; Process industries; Process control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045273,,,"English","Proc.

The trust-based security mechanism of TESDA allows the sink and cluster head to estimate a deviation based trust and it diminishes the impact of the compromised sensor node contribution in aggregation performance. By considering the current trust values of sensor nodes in the cluster head election process, the TESDA optimizes the cluster head election performance and also enhances the routing performance By electing a CH based on residual energy, the clustering mechanism of TESDA attains fair energy consumption among nodes within the cluster.

Unlike the conventional PI controller, in the proposed controller the gains are no longer fixed. It is dynamically adjusted by the fuzzy logic-based intelligent supervisory control system according to system operating conditions. Thus, the intelligent supervisory control system forces the controller to work in a linear region for a wide range of operating conditions and improves the dynamic performance.

The distributed nature of this network has several QoS issues and these are addressed by the clustered QoS routing protocol. Due to the dynamic nature of the wireless sensor network the nodes may move from one position to another position. If the moved node is a header node and it is not in the communication range of its neighbor header, then there will be link breakage between two header nodes. Once such link failure occurs, then single network will be partitioned into two different networks. They cannot communicate each other and it leads to packet dropping. Existing methods addresses link failure by rerouting protocols. But it will take time to construct rerouting. To address this issue, a Header to base station and base station to header (H2B2H) protocol is proposed. When there is a link failure between two header nodes, that is, between predecessor CH and successor CH, the proposed protocol will be automatically invoked. According to the proposed H2B2H protocol, the predecessor will send the data to the base station. The base station has information about all the nodes. So the base station will take the responsibility to forward the data to the destination group cluster head. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm increases throughput, packet delivery rate, network life time and decreases the packet dropping rate, end to end delay, energy consumption of header nodes and routing overheads. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","H2B2H protocol; Link breakage; Network partition; Packet dropping; Predecessor CH; QoS; Successor CH","Base stations; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Packet loss; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Telecommunication links; Wireless sensor networks; Link breakages; Network partitions; Packet dropping; Predecessor CH; Successor CH; Sensor nodes","Krishnan, R.; Deprtment of Infornation Technology, PSNA College of Engineering&TechnologyIndia; email: rajkumardgl@psnacet.edu.in",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034116004

Therefore, we propose an Enhanced Routing Protocol for LLNs (ERPL), which updates the Preferred Parent (PP) of the Mobile Node (MN) quickly whenever the MN moves away from the already selected PP. Further, a new objective function that takes the mobility of the node into an account while selecting a PP is proposed. Performance of the ERPL has been evaluated with the varying system and traffic parameters under different topologies similar to most of the real-life networks. The simulation results showed that the proposed ERPL reduced the power consumption, packet overhead, latency and increased the packet delivery ratio as compared to other existing works. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Distance; Low Power and Lossy Networks; Objective function; Preferred Parent; Routing protocol","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Topology; Distance; Lossy networks; Mobility support protocol; Objective functions; Preferred Parent; Real time data transmission; Sensor node mobilities; Technological advancement; Low power electronics","Sanshi, S.; Department of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: it15f03.sanshi@nitk.edu.in",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033490235

Normally, the sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a square network field and applying clustering technique extends the lifetime of the network. In our proposed work, energy efficient concentric circular clustering protocol(EECCCP), the energy heterogeneity normal and the super nodes having flat topology while the advance nodes having clustering topology, are deployed in different zones of concentric circular network field. A hybrid communication with energy heterogeneity increases the network lifetime. The protocol considers the average energy of the network and residual energy of the nodes to select the cluster-heads. Since the network field is circular with the base station at the center and the nodes with same energy are deployed at equal distance from the base station, this topology increases the network life time and stability of the network.

The key idea of this system uses MANET environments to publicize the truths by increasing the data transmission rate. This influences to changed security problems such as collision, conflict et cetera. These problems would decrease the scattering of the packet ratio. In the preceding research method Interference Avoidance using CoEfficient of Restitution Measure (IA-CERM) is accomplished. This would compute the “restitution” of a collision of a node that is accomplished due to discovering the incoming packets from above one node by opening up this calculation, mounting enhanced route could be accomplished by reducing the interference effect. On the other hand these techniques are short of from the interference all through the subsistence of various paths existence. This is solved in the presented research methodology by proposing the new research methodology called as Multi-Path Interference aware Route Path Establishment (MP-IRPE). In this stage, dynamic analysis route behavior is carried out to discover the route path breakage priory. The non-interfering numerous paths will be chosen parallel while the data’s broadcasting via the principal path to avoid the path breakage. Therefore the instantaneous re-routing could be carried out without delay; consequently the waiting time could be minimized significantly. In this work optimal routing is done with the consideration of multiple QoS parameters using pareto-optimal approach as like in our previous work QoS and interference aware routing in dynamic MANET. The QoS parameters considered are “bandwidth, power, delay, link stability and reliability”. The whole assessment of the research method is performed and executed in the NS2 simulation environment. So, it is shown that the proposed methodology give improved result compared to the existing techniques. While comparing with other familiar protocols, MP-IRPE gives fine qualities in relation to overhead latency, and packet losses.

Heterogeneity in terms of energy in the devices independent or embedded is an inherent property of WSNs for internet-of-things. Dissimilar energy consumption of sensor nodes has become a crucial factor for the designing and development of clustering protocols. Stability period and network lifetime are the basic parameters for the realization of network from energy balancing point of view. Scalability in the network with variant number of nodes as well as different values of energies has allowed analysis of stability period, network lifetime and also sub-periods of lifetime for better connectivity, coverage and efficient communication in the above mentioned web applications. Periodic assessment of sub periods of lifetime for event based dynamic monitoring of the objects in internet-of-things will prove advantageous in the coming decades. A protocol based on broad and crossover transmission distance for heterogeneous wireless sensor network system is proposed here.

We allow for imperfect communication links, where information packets may be lost due to noise and collisions. The packets that are received correctly are used to estimate the objects' trajectories by employing an extended Kalman Filter, where provisions are made to accommodate a randomly changing number of obseravtions in each iteration. An adaptive rate control scheme is additionally applied to instruct the sensor nodes on how to adjust their transmission rate so as to improve the location estimation accuracy and the energy efficiency of the system. By focusing explicitly on the objects' locations, rather than working with a pre-specified grid of potential locations, we resolve the spatial quantization issues associated with sparse identification methods. Finally, we extend the method to address the possibility of objects entering and departing the observation area, thus improving the scalability of the system and relaxing the requirement for accurate knowledge of the objects' initial locations.

For saving resources as well as energy, data should be collated for reducing quantity of traffic in the network. Data aggregation is to be carried out with the assistance of a clustering strategy. Cluster-based routing in WSNs is an effective solution for enhancing energy efficacy of nodes as well as resourceful data aggregation. Several studies on network life time as well as data aggregation are suggested with low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) scheme which permits the part of the cluster head (CH) to be rotated amongst the sensor nodes and focuses on the distribution of energy use throughout all nodes. Life time of WSNs are impacted by the choosing of CHs; this is due to the fact that CH consumed more energy than other member nodes. In the current work, an energy effective CH election in mobile WSNs is suggested, analysed as well as evaluated based on residual energy as well as randomized election of nodes that were not designated as CHs in earlier rounds. The study proposes random competition based clustering (RCC) strategy which is more stable than the traditional clustering strategies like Lower ID (LID). IWO or Invasive Weed Optimization is a metaheuristic that has been developed recently to mimic the behaviour of the weeds. But the spatial dispersal operators and reproduction in the IWO that was originally used can make the seeds stay around the weed that is considered best that can result in convergence prematurely. In order to overcome this, EIWO or Enhanced IWO algorithm has been developed using TS or Tabu Search.

Due to multiple node failures, network topology may change or partition into many disconnected segments causing data/query path breakage. Early detection and recovery of faults is desirable in most scenarios. Also, due to limited battery life of a node, the solution must consume minimum possible energy for prolonged network operation. Hence in this paper, we propose a Fault Detection and Recovery scheme which is an energy efficient fault detection and recovery strategy that achieves minimum data loss by efficiently replacing faulty node on the present route or by finding full or partial alternate paths. Topology is managed by constructing a virtual grid over the entire network which helps in managing dynamically changing network topology easily and makes failure detection and recovery effective. It also helps to create energy efficient path between a source and a sink by finding shortest possible path. Further, nodes’ cooperation is exploited to create certain zones on the data/query path which provides alternate nodes or possible alternate paths if required on some node failures. Thus, scheme achieves fault tolerance and at the same time achieves energy efficiency by always selecting shortest path for data delivery between source and sink.

The most widely accepted method to preserve energy of sensor nodes is clustering. In cluster based networks, energy consumption is higher in the nodes which are closer to the sink as compared to the nodes which are located farther away from base station (BS). Various unequal clustering algorithms were proposed in the past to correct this issue. The major drawbacks in the findings are that the nodes, which join a specific cluster head, cause overburdening of the cluster head. In this paper, we present an algorithm namely energy efficient unequal sector clustering (EUSC) using multi-sector and unequal clustering approaches which improve the network’s energy efficiency. EUSC divides the network into multiple sectors based on nodes distances from BS. Selection of cluster heads in each sector is based on nodes distances to BS, residual energy and neighbor nodes proximities in that sector. Selection of a relay cluster head for data transmission is also based on residual energy, nodes distances to BS and queue length of nodes. In this paper, we have carried out some theoretical analysis of the nodes energy consumption in each sector and derived an expression for optimal number of clusters in each sector to minimize nodes energy consumption. Various simulations were carried out with MATLAB package to differentiate the competency of the proposed EUSC algorithm with that of the existing protocols ECHA and ‘PSO based protocol’. Simulation results in different network scenarios indicate that EUSC has given much improved performance than ECHA and ‘PSO based protocol’ in terms of number of clusters formed during each round, network lifetime and energy efficiency. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Energy consumption; Sector; Unequal clusters; Wireless sensor networks","Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based networks; Energy efficient; Energy minimization; Number of clusters; Sector; Unequal clustering; Unequal clusters; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Sundaran, K.; School of Computing, SRM UniversityIndia; email: karthika.su@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032939072

One of the core challenges of WSN is to increase the network life time, meaning that the efficiency of power utilisation should be the maximum. The major reasons for high power consumption are drawn out transmission path to reach sink, work load add-ons on nodes closer to storage medium, and the energy necessary for storage. This study proposes a novel method of data storage and retrieval for WSN environment to improve the network lifetime by minimising the energy consumption. The proposed method accomplishes this milestone using four novel algorithms, namely weighted optimum storage-node placement(SNP), efficient and energetic wireless recharging, efficient rule-based node rotation and critical-state-data passing.

The mobile sink moves throughout the network and collects data in a single-hop fashion resulting in less energy consumption of the sensor nodes. Despite the advantage of this scheme, data forwarding to the mobile sink during an emergency situation is a major issue that should be dealt with. For efficient data delivery within the stipulated deadline, the sensor node which has sensed a delay-intolerant data needs to forward the data towards the mobile sink. In this paper, a Moore curve based trajectory of the mobile sink has been considered for efficient sink based data collection. This work is also motivated by anycast forwarding of delay sensitive data to the mobile sink before the sensed data lose its relevance, where the node follows a strict sleep-wake pattern. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory based data collection scheme by simulation using MATLAB. The delay-intolerant data routing scheme (DRS) shows that the data reaches the mobile sink within the given deadline while restricting the energy dissipation of the sensor nodes to a minimum. This have been verified by extensive simulations which show that when compared to static sink, the usage of a mobile sink improves the network lifetime by almost 12%. This work has also been compared with an existing work (PMDD) to show its validity. The simulation results depict that DRS shows an improvement of about 25%–29% in terms of network lifetime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data dissemination; Mobile sink trajectory; Moore space filling curve; Sleep-wake scheduling; Wireless sensor network (WSN)","Data acquisition; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Network routing; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Wakes; Data collection scheme; Data dissemination; Emergency situation; Extensive simulations; Mobile sinks; Moore space; Sleep-wake scheduling; Trajectory-based routing; Wireless sensor networks","Ghosh, N.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, Howrah-711 103, India; email: ghosh.nimisha@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00457906,,CPEEB,,"English","Comput Electr Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028717065

The factors like multipath fading, path loss, Doppler spread, limited battery power, and high mobility void region cause UWSNs to become spatially variable. In this paper, the idea of Geography-based Opportunistic Routing (GOR) is applied to advance the packet towards the destination and to handle the void problem. The proposed design is termed as Void Handling using Geo-Opportunistic Routing (VHGOR). In executing so, a heuristic algorithm comprising two metrics, namely OREPP and NCD for optimal forwarder selection is proposed. Additionally, a void handling mechanism is also proposed that handles void in two ways. Quick hull algorithm that makes a convex hull assists to identify whether the void is convex or concave. When the node approaches a convex void, reconstruction of convex hull helps to determine an alternative way to resume the greedy forwarding if the node has neighbors within its proximity. Failure of convex void handling during communication void makes VHGOR switch to concave void handling (or) recovery mode to recover the packet from local maximum node and to route the packet to the destination. At the end of simulation, the proposed VHGOR results considerably improve the network performance when compared with the existing solutions, both in sparse and very dense networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Convex hull; Geography Opportunistic Routing; Local maximum; Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks; Void handling","Computational geometry; Heuristic algorithms; Network routing; Underwater acoustics; Wireless sensor networks; Convex hull; Local maximum; Opportunistic routing; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Void handling; Sensor nodes","Kanthimathi, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: kanthimathi.phd@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00457906,,CPEEB,,"English","Comput Electr Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027506588

In order to establish a dynamic session secret amongst a group of sensor nodes in a WSN, group-key broadcast is found to be a workable solution. However, when a node misses one or more group-key broadcast messages, rebroadcasting results in additional energy consumption at node end and increased network traffic as well. Self-healing mechanism is, therefore, used to recover the lost broadcasts using a future session broadcast. A node, that has missed multiple consecutive broadcasts and does not want to wait for a future broadcast, can obtain the session key through mutual-healing with the help of a neighbor node. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient mutual-healing protocol that uses Chinese remainder theorem(CRT) based secret sharing for group key broadcast. During mutual-healing, mutual authentication and key confirmation are provided. The probability of an unauthorized member retrieving a past session key through self-healing or responding to a mutual-healing request as a neighbor node is shown negligible.

The routing algorithm builds a trade-off between energy efficiency and energy balancing, whereas the clustering algorithm takes care of the energy consumption of gateways as well as sensor nodes. We develop an efficient particle-encoding scheme and derive a multi-objective fitness function for each of the proposed routing and clustering algorithms.

In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a sensor node collects all the data and forwarded to a sink node. The position of the sink node has a huge impact on the energy consumption and lifetime of WSNs. The collected data is transmitted through multihop communication to the sink. Data aggregation is a well-known approach in WSN and it is a process of collecting and aggregating the data from multiple sensors to provide combined information to the base station. This process repeats for many rounds in collecting these data efficiently that is to reduce the energy cost of data transmission. Traditionally tree-based structured approach is a basic operation for periodically sensing and collecting reports from all sensors nodes and sends it to the sink. It can find the shortest path between the leaf nodes and sink for transmitting the data in more efficient way in order to reduce the energy utilization. It is been known that this paper proposes algorithms such as Angular Query Region Division Routing Algorithm In Angular algorithm data aggregation protocol are used for sensing and collecting the data.

In WMSNs, communication links are typically error-prone and unreliable. The presence of bad quality links on a path may cause higher packet error rate and results in low throughput. This paper presents Link Quality and Energy-Aware Routing (LQEAR) scheme, which finds energy-aware high-quality links along the path. Next forwarding node is selected based on the link quality, remaining energy and the distance between next forwarding node and the sink. The adaptive cost function can be customized for reliable and high throughput transmission, high network lifetime, and for balanced optimal QoS performance.

In this article, we propose a mechanism to solve this issue of ordering task executions within a CPS that inherently handles mutual exclusion. The mechanism caters to a decentralized and distributed CPS comprising nodes such as computers, robots, and sensor nodes and uses mobile software agents that knit through them to aid the execution of the various tasks while also ensuring mutual exclusion of shared resources. The computations, communications, and control are achieved through these mobile agents. Physical execution of the tasks is performed by the robots in an asynchronous and pipelined manner without the use of a clock. The mechanism also features addition and deletion of tasks and insertion and removal of robots facilitating On-The-Fly Programming.

In such monitoring systems, the sensor nodes at the network boundary require remaining vigilant to detect events like objects entering and leaving the area under surveillance. Nodes performing surveillance of target area can be classified as boundary node and others as an interior node. Due to continuous vigilance, boundary node suffers from quicker energy exhaustion (compare to internal nodes) which results to a shorter life span of the node. None of the reported works on boundary detection algorithms have considered the problem of maximizing the lifetime of boundary nodes. The problem of maximizing the lifetime of boundary nodes collectively addresses the problem of an optimal number of boundary nodes detection and maximization of boundary node's lifetime. In this work, we formulate the problem of the maximum lifetime of the boundary as the problem of partitioning the boundary region of the network into disjoint dominating sets of a boundary region with the aim of maximizing the number of disjoint dominating sets of a boundary region in the network. This is the problem of the domatic partition of boundary region in graph theory, where each partition is dominating the set of boundary region (i.e., not the dominating set of entire network). Rotating the disjoint dominating sets of boundary region in the network resulting into maximizing the lifetimes of boundary nodes. We found that our disjoint dominating sets of boundary region algorithm have an approximation ratio ((4.8+ln5)opt+1.2), where opt is the minimum size dominating set which has the same approximation ratio as the minimum dominating set problem. The time complexity of boundary detection algorithm is O(mn2) where m=|Euk∖1|, n=|Nuk∖1| and k is the radius of graph. Simulation results reveal that using our proposed domatic partition of boundary region algorithm, the boundary node saves 35.71% energy lesser as compared to without domatic partition based boundary detection algorithm. To support our claim, we extended our work one step further and performed the experimental analysis of our proposed algorithm on telosb motes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Distributed sensor networks; Pervasive computing; Surveillance","Approximation algorithms; Complex networks; Distributed computer systems; Graph theory; Monitoring; Object detection; Sensor nodes; Signal detection; Space surveillance; Ubiquitous computing; Approximation ratios; Boundary detection algorithms; Disjoint dominating sets; Distributed sensor networks; Experimental analysis; Minimum dominating set; Monitoring system; Network boundaries; Wireless sensor networks","Shukla, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jaypee University of Information TechnologyIndia; email: shailendra.shukla@juit.ac.in",,"Academic Press Inc.",07437315,,JPDCE,,"English","J.

Another unique pattern observed from literatures is that majority of such techniques are cluster based which causes latency in data fusion mechanism. Therefore, this paper has discussed a tree-based data fusion technique using an extra module termed as core fusion node, which ensures energy aware and non-redundant data to be fused by the fusion node and then transmit to the base station using multiple-hops.

We propose Optimized Discharge-Curve-based Coverage Protocol (ODCP) to handle these problems. ODCP determines optimal sleep schedules for redundant nodes using their neighboring active nodes’ battery discharge rate, failure probability, and coverage overlap information.

Though disjoint clusters are generally preferred, overlapping clusters find its prominence in some applications of inter-cluster routing, time-synchronization and node localization. Replica node detection is a major challenge in overlapping clusters. This paper aims at replica node detection in overlapping clusters based on two methods, Replica detection based on RFID (RDBRFID) and Replica detection based on Localization techniques (RDBLT). The first method uses RFID for unique node identification and the second method detects replica by identifying its locality based on received signal strength (RSSI) and Triangulation method. These methods are implemented and their performance is compared with Multicast and non clustered methods: Randomized multicast (RM), Line selected multicast (LSM), Fault tolerant virtual back bone tree (FTVBT) and K-coverage WSN. It is observed that RDBRFID exhibits better detection rate and lesser communication overhead due to its deterministic approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cloning attacks; Intrusion detection; Replication attacks; Sensor network security; Wireless sensor network","Intrusion detection; Multicasting; Network security; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Clustering in wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Deterministic approach; Hierarchical wireless sensor networks; Inter-cluster routing; Localization technique; Received signal strength; Replication attacks; Wireless sensor networks","Rani, T.P.; Department of Information Technology, Sri Sai Ram Engineering College, Anna UniversityIndia; email: rani.it@sairam.edu.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",00457906,,CPEEB,,"English","Comput Electr Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027971932

Normally, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network gets fragmented. To mitigate this issue, we propose a three phase energy balanced zone based routing protocol. Specifically, in the first phase the region is physically divided into equi-sized zones. In the second phase, a node with minimum traffic and minimum distance from other nodes inside each zone is selected as the zone leader. This leader is responsible for delivering data generated by any node in that zone and for routing and forwarding the data received from other zone leaders of the neighbor zones. In the third phase, zones are categorized as non-congested, medium-congested and congested zones and route path is established in inter and intra zones. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the zone congestion levels along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed both at inter and intra zone levels in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 10.5% enhancement in the network throughput, 19.5% energy saving when compared with grid-based multi-path GMCAR with congestion avoidance and 23.03% energy saving when compared with priority-based application-specific congestion control clustering protocol PASCC. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Congestion control; Energy efficient; Gradient value; Wireless Sensor Networks; Zone based routing","Congestion control (communication); Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Application specific; Clustering protocol; Congestion avoidance; Congestion control mechanism; Energy efficient; Experimental evaluation; Performance degradation; Zone-based; Wireless sensor networks","Sunitha, G.P.; Dept. of ISE, Jawaharlal Nehru National College Of EngineeringIndia; email: sunithagp17@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023172078

However, recent advances in multimedia technology have led to the availability of a wide range of sensors with widely varying capabilities. The introduction of multimedia sensors has presented additional challenges such as requirement of application-specific quality of service (QoS), high bandwidth and low delay. This paper presents an enhanced ant-based QoS-aware routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (EAQHSeN). It is a differentiated service-based QoS routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with multimedia and scalar nodes. We have used bio-inspired routing heuristics, and the key feature of the protocol is its ability to meet diverse QoS requirements claimed by heterogeneous traffic generated by the nodes. The routing decision is taken independently for control traffic, scalar traffic and multimedia traffic, thus maximizing the network performance and utilization. Simulation results show that the proposed EAQHSeN protocol performs better than the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol and energy-efficient ant-based routing (EEABR) protocol. The average percentage improvement in minimum residual energy by EAQHSeN over EEABR is approximately 4 % which is an indication of extended lifetime. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ant routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor network; Heuristic function; Multimedia packets; QoS routing; Scalar packets","Energy efficiency; Heuristic algorithms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routers; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Ant routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Heuristic functions; Multimedia packets; QoS routing; Scalar packets; Sensor nodes","Woungang, I.; Department of Computer Science, Ryerson UniversityCanada; email: iwoungan@scs.ryerson.ca",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987608817

To achieve this, we propose a variant of the DCP technique with autonomous constellation selection at the different SNs. In the first stage of the two-stage time division duplexed cophasing scheme, the SNs obtain estimates of the channels to the FC using pilot symbols transmitted by the latter. Following this, the SNs simultaneously transmit their data symbols prerotated according to the estimated channel phases to combine coherently at the FC. The symbols transmitted by different SNs are drawn from possibly different constellations selected based on the estimated instantaneous channel gains. We show that this scheme is equivalent to transmitting symbols from hierarchical constellations. Based on the properties of hierarchical constellations, we develop recursive expressions for the BER of the proposed system. Following this, we use the properties of the effective channel coefficients to show that it is possible to recover the transmitted data bits from the signal received at the FC blindly, without requiring explicit pilot symbols to be sent by the power-starved SNs. We develop three blind channel estimation and data detection schemes for the presented system model. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed blind channel estimation algorithm achieves a probability of error performance close to that with genie aided perfect channel state information (CSI) at the FC, while using only a moderate number of unknown data symbols for channel estimation. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","adaptive Modulation; blind channel estimation; data fusion; Distributed co-phasing; hierarchical constellations; wireless sensor networks","Adaptive modulation; Blind equalization; Data fusion; Data integration; Error correction; Errors; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Personnel training; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Testbeds; Wireless sensor networks; Blind channel estimation; Blind equalizer; Co-phasing; Constellation diagrams; Error correction codes; Hierarchical constellation; Channel estimation","Chopra, R.; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: ribhu@outlook.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1053587X,,ITPRE,,"English","IEEE Trans Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028997097

Session key establishment between the sensor node and the user is also required for secure communication. In this paper, we perform the security analysis of A.K.Das's user authentication scheme (given in 2015), Choi et al.'s scheme (given in 2016), and Park et al.'s scheme (given in 2016). The security analysis shows that their schemes are vulnerable to various attacks like user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack and attacks based on legitimate users. Based on the cryptanalysis of these existing protocols, we propose a secure and efficient authenticated session key establishment protocol which ensures various security features and overcomes the drawbacks of existing protocols. The formal and informal security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol withstands the various security vulnerabilities involved in WSNs. The automated validation using AVISPA and Scyther tool ensures the absence of security attacks in our scheme. The logical verification using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic confirms the correctness of the proposed protocol. Finally, the comparative analysis based on computational overhead and security features of other existing protocol indicate that the proposed user authentication system is secure and efficient.

Due to the popularity gained by the wireless environment, Security is the main concern. Node authentication without compromising lifespan of the networks is practically a daunting task. This research work introduces a new model, IBE-ECC that administers the energy of sensor nodes with faster authentication process. Signature verification model is deployed to achieve faster authentication process. Nevertheless, the public key-based strategies eliminate the security process but their verification process takes larger time. Therefore, authentication speed is a major constraint of our research endeavor. The proposed scheme is design to achieve high security and fast authentication with energy efficiency. It uses identity-based encryption on elliptic curve cryptography and a user authentication with an energy efficient key management. Further, to improve the speed of the authentication, it reduces the signature size so that it would accelerate signature verification faster. Hence, the proposed scheme will provide a secure key management, energy efficiency, fast authentication and additionally, computation overhead and communication costs are minimized.

Clustering is either classified as static and dynamic or as equal and unequal. In cluster based routing protocols that employ multi-hop communication, imbalanced energy consumption among the nodes results in hot-spots. Unequal clustering overcomes hot-spots but requires a high overhead and is prone to connectivity issues. To offer guaranteed connectivity and alleviate the hot-spot problem, a zone divisional hierarchical routing protocol has been proposed in this paper. The network is divided into equal sized static rectangular clusters which are assigned to two zones namely near zone and far zone. The zone facing the base station is known as the near zone and rest of the network space makes up the far zone which is further divided into sub-zones. Dual cluster heads approach for sharing the reception, aggregation and forwarding tasks is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol against the existing protocols reveals that the method offers energy-efficient multi-hop communication support, uses negligible overhead, prevents creation of hot-spots, avoids early death of nodes, uses balanced energy consumption across the network and maximizes the network lifetime. © 2016 IEEE.","clustering; hot-spots; multi-hop; network lifetime","Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Balanced energy consumption; Cluster based routing protocols; clustering; Communication bandwidth; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hot spot; Multihop; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks",,"Tomar G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509011445,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

These nodes are battery powered due to which energy of a node plays a vital role. The amount of the energy used up by any node while the data is transmitted, it needs to be optimized so that the less amount of energy is consumed. The efficiency of the WSN depends on the numerous performance parameter of the network. A lifetime of network and energy consumption is the most important parameters in the design of a WSN. Various routing protocols have been designed to find the route in the network. Various energy efficient protocols have such as LEACH, DEEC, etc. were proposed, later on with Bio-inspired optimization like ACO, GA, PSO, etc. were used for finding the route in the network to increase the efficiency of the wireless sensor network but still there was need to design the algorithms that are more efficient than these in terms of energy consumption and network life, so in this paper an advancement in the PSO algorithm is proposed.

WSN consists of small nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. In WSN, clustering is used as an effective technique to achieve scalability, self-organization, power saving, channel access, routing etc. Lifetime of sensor nodes determines the lifetime of the network and is crucial for the sensing capability. Clustering is the key technique used to extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In this proposed method, the node next to the present cluster head is selected as the new cluster head if its energy is greater than the threshold energy. Moreover all the nodes used in this method are mobile nodes. Mobile nodes increases the scope of gathering updated information. Mobile nodes also have a chance of entering remote area where cluster head cannot reach them. In this case the nodes die. In the proposed method this problem is solved, whenever the nodes tends to move out of the cluster, the nodes generates a random angle to which it is redirected. This approach will increase the network lifetime and will provide high throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","Clustering; Mobile Nodes; Network; Routing; Scalability; Wireless Communication","Network routing; Networks (circuits); Routing protocols; Scalability; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clustering; Mobile nodes; Mobile sensor networks; Routing; Self organizations; Updated informations; Wireless communication capabilities; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks",,"Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538622155,,,"English","Ind.

Sensors nodes are energy constraints devices. For the sustainability of sensor networks energy optimization is the prime challenge for researchers which can be achieved by efficient design of clustering routing protocols. LEACH is one of the most renowned hierarchical routing protocols which prepare the fields for many other routing protocols for WSN. An enhanced version of LEACH is the EEEAC protocol which is an adaptive clustering based on residual energy of each node and generated uniform cluster heads over the network. Unlike EEEAC which considers unique identification of subarea code, for locating the nodes position in this paper we use the threshold level of mean link quality of sensor node for sub-area division. This process reduces the cost complexity and size of sensor nodes and non-functioning of GPS within indoor environment for area division. The significant contribution of this work lies in the real test bed implementation of both LEACH and our proposed model under SENSEnuts. Network stability and battery consumption are evaluated practically which shows that the modified EEEAC (mEEEAC) is the more energy efficient enhancing network lifetime. © 2017 IEEE.","clustering; energy efficient protocol; Hierarchical routing; Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH); TDMA schedule; Wireless Sensor networks (WSN)","Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Low power electronics; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Sustainable development; Time division multiple access; clustering; Clustering routing protocol; Energy Efficient clustering; Energy efficient protocols; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hierarchical routings; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509056194,,,"English","Proc.

One such attack is Node Replication attack, where the attacker creates multiple clones /replicas of the legitimate node and deploys them at various paths in the network. As these replicas behave exactly like legitimate node, it is very difficult to detect them in the network. The presence of replicas mainly aims at disrupting the services of the network, thereby decreasing the performance of the same. Many research works have been carried out to detect the replicas in the network, but still each of the mechanisms have some push-backs. This paper mainly analyses the use of a Zone based routing protocol(ZRP) for Clone detection and how effectively routing can be done even in the presence of a clone in the network.

In WSN, effective use of energy resource is one of the challenging research issues as the battery limits the lifetime of sensor node. The Rumor Routing has advantages in energy saving by making full use of two features: clustering structure and next-hop scheme. This rumor routing algorithm in WSN allows query source to distribute query to identify source which helps to get timely query message but the energy efficiency is made better using hierarchical method by clustering formation, where the appropriate selection of cluster head reduces energy conservation. So we have fuzzy logic as the proposed method which is based on three features : Centrality, Energy, Distance. The mobile co-ordinator is used in this method to increase the network efficiency. Thus fuzzy logic can effectively avoid the problems that occur in RR and can provide more energy-efficient routing paths. The performance between fuzzy logic using mobile co-ordinator and RR are evaluated by simulations. This simulation results indicate that compared with RR, the fuzzy logic can save energy consumption, provide better path, and increases delivery rate. © 2017 IEEE.","fuzzy logic; Mobile coordinator; RR; WSN","Computer circuits; Data communication systems; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Energy efficient routing; Hierarchical method; Mobile coordinator; Network efficiency; Query message; Real-time application; Research issues; Energy efficiency",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

In-network data aggregation removes redundancy as well as unnecessary data forwarding, and hence cuts on the energy used in communications. However such accumulation is known to be profoundly powerless against compromising assaults. Since sensor nodes are typically unattended and without alter safe equipment, they are exceptionally helpless to such assaults.

Use of multiple sinks provides fault tolerance and load balancing. In tree based networks, every sink becomes root of exactly one tree. When node deployment is not uniform across the region, some trees become very dense and others are sparse. When scheduling is done, dense tree results in higher schedule length than the sparse one. For aggregated convergecast, schedule length minimization is an important objective. In this work, we have proposed an algorithm which allows every node to decide which sink (i.e. tree) to join such that schedule lengths of trees remain balanced.

The routing protocol for wireless sensor networks mainly aims in the energy-efficiency of the network. Due to restricted energy, memory, transmission range, power and high traffic load, the nodes which act as a sink get depleted quickly. Because of these so many approaches proposed over past years to reduce energy consumption and to prolong network lifetime. Energy consumption of the network can be reduced by means of using the mobile sink and it also reduces the hotspot problem. Hence Virtual Grid based Data Gathering technique using mobile agent (VGDG-MA) for WSN with mobile sink is proposed. Mobile agent is the one which is used to collect the data by flexibly planning its route. In this paper, virtual grid based data gathering technique using mobile agent is presented that mainly aims to reduce the route construction path frequently in a grid structure. Mobile agent is placed in a multihop environment which automatically clones and migrates based on the environmental changes. Instead of mobile sink, these mobile agents migrate in the environment and collect data, clone when it leaves the particular node results in energy consumption and also reduce the construction cost of the network. Based on residual energy of the node, sink relocates its position and avoids network failure. Proposed method shows that mobile agent can powerfully transfer data from sink to source and source to which results in energy consumption, good packet delivery ratio. Simulation results shows that the proposed VGDG-MA increases the network lifetime and gives better results in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and throughput when compared with other protocols. Simulation is carried out in OMNeT++. © 2017 IEEE.","mobile agent; mobile sink; sink relocation; virtual grid; wireless sensor networks","Cloning; Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Environmental change; Mobile sinks; Packet delivery ratio; Real-time application; Reduce energy consumption; Sink relocation; Virtual grids; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Mobile agents",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

Implementation of these networks face immense challenges due to short wireless range; along with limited power, storage & computational capabilities of SNs. Also, due to the tiny physical attributes of the SNs in WSNs, they are prone to physical attacks. In the context of WSNs, the physical attacks may range from destroying, lifting, replacing and adding new SNs. The work in this paper addresses the threats induced due to physical attacks and, further proposes a methodology to mitigate it. The methodology incorporates the use of newly proposed secured and efficient symmetric and asymmetric key distribution technique based on the additional commodity hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Further, the paper demonstrates the merits of the proposed methodology. With some additional economical cost for the hardware, the proposed technique can fulfill the security requirement of WSNs, like confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, resilience to attack, key connectivity and data freshness. © 2017 IEEE.","Asymmetric Key Cryptography; Hierarchical Wireless Sensor Networks; Key Distribution; Key Pre-distribution; Pair-wise; Security; Symmetric Key Cryptography; Trusted Platform Module","Cryptography; Digital storage; Hardware; Hardware security; Network security; Sensor nodes; Trusted computing; Wireless ad hoc networks; Asymmetric key cryptography; Hierarchical wireless sensor networks; Key distribution; Key pre-distribution; Pair-wise; Security; Symmetric key cryptography; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are subjected to node failures because of energy constraints; also nodes can be added to or removed from the network upon application demands, leading to unpredictable topology changes. Bursty traffic resulted from the detected events will simply cause congestion within the networks, especially in high rate applications. Congestion might occur at a sensor which causes energy waste, throughput, reliability and packet loss. The packets are scheduled by scheduling unit and based upon the priority number the data packet is send from the source to the destination. The packet scheduling algorithm provides an efficient scheduling rate to prevent the packet loss at each flow. By controlling the scheduling rate congestion prevention in the Network is possible.

The effective packet transmission through wireless senor networks is a quite challenging task as the malicious nodes might often lead to packet loss or corruption which should be avoided by the reliable method of packet transmission. Hence the present research focuses on employing a novel method for secured transmission of data packets. By proposing the communication and threshold based cryptographic mechanism (CTCM), the insider attackers present in the cluster nodes can be considered for enhancing the security of the wireless sensor network. The behavior of malicious node is first located by keeping some monitoring nodes in the communication environment. The monitoring nodes will communicate the information on malicious node to as much nodes as possible for secured data transmission. The secret keys are also shared to other set of sensor nodes. This ensures that the data can be accessed by the node only when it possesses the specific shares unless which the nodes are refrained from sharing their secret key as it is considered malicious. The evaluation of the experimental results are performed in MATLAB simulation environment and compared with the existing approaches in terms of various performance metrics. The simulation results have proved that the proposed CTCM mechanism shows higher performance compared to other available methods. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Communication; Malicious nodes; Security; Shared key; Threshold sharing","Access control; Communication; Data communication systems; Data transfer; MATLAB; Network security; Packet networks; Wireless sensor networks; Communication environments; Malicious nodes; Reliable data transmission; Security; Shared key; Threshold sharing; Transmission of data; Wireless senor network; Sensor nodes","Kavitha, R.J.; Department of ECE, University College of Engineering, Panruti, (A Constituent College of Anna University Chennai)India; email: kavithajothi1978@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031400917

However, the design of an efficient path for the mobile sink is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithms to determine rendezvous point (RP) based dynamic path for mobile sink called delay aware energy density based trajectory (DAEDT). The DAEDT designs an energy efficient delay bound path for the mobile sink. In order to balance energy consumption among the sensor nodes, the proposed algorithm selects RPs based on the energy density of the sensor nodes. The DAEDT is also presented with a detour criteria following some threshold. The algorithm is extensively simulated and the results of DAEDT are compared with some existing schemes to show its effectiveness over various performance metrics.

Precisely WSNs are well-known in real time applications using homogeneous sensor nodes. As sensor nodes are battery powered, it will become dead after consumption of the battery which decides the lifetime of WSNs. The battery of sensor nodes is neither replaced nor recharged. Hence it is essential to introduce the techniques to prolong the lifetime of the WSNs. Heterogeneous nodes in wireless sensor network is an effective way to increase network lifetime. This involves the need for energy efficiency in heterogeneous WSNs. Limitation on energy is a major concern, and hence it can be managed efficiently using clustering. In homogeneous clustering, each sensor node has equal initial energy but in heterogeneous clustering. There are two or more types of sensor nodes that have different initial energy. This paper describes the various heterogeneous WSN protocols that carry out a survey of the recent clustering protocols for heterogeneous WSNs.

Since the sensors are constrained by battery power, so lifetime of the network and the energy efficiency becomes a challenging for WSN. To solve this problem many clusters-based routing protocols are proposed like LEACH, TEEN, SEP. This paper deals with Threshold Sensitive Energy Efficient Network Protocol (TEEN) which is a reactive cluster based protocol. It is specially designed for critical application of time. As multiple nodes are required for cooperative communication, TEEN Protocol is used for cluster formation. Further Vector Quantization (VQ) is used for analysis of low energy path for the nodes and clusters respectively. The main issue of inter cluster node communication is carried out in earlier work using TEEN protocol. The proposed technique illustrates the TEEN-Vector Quantization (TEEN-V) protocol, for intra-cluster communication in a cooperative communication network. As per the application point of view, TEEN-V performs the lowest energy path for intra cluster communication. TEEN provides the optimum cluster size and their cluster head and using VQ, the minimum distance is calculated using Euclidean distance between the multiple cluster heads which creates the shortest path results in energy efficient technique. Further the spectral distortion of the proposed technique has been analysed for practical implementation. © 2017 IEEE.","cooperative communication; Energy efficient; TEEN; Vector Quantization; Wireless Sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Vector quantization; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based protocol; Energy efficient; Energy efficient networks; Energy-efficient techniques; Intra-cluster communication; Multiple cluster-heads; Research applications; TEEN; Cooperative communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032433,,,"English","Proc.

Nowadays, the congestion becomes major cumbersome to degrade the network performance. Due to congestion, some of the significant packets are lost to mitigate the quality. To surmount this congestion issue, the Epsilon constraint-based Adaptive Cuckoo Search Rate Optimization algorithm is proposed. Initially, the occurrence of congestion is detected by incoming packets (traffic) of sensor nodes. Then, the congestion level is determined by virtual queue length. If congestion occurs, then it is fed into the proposed optimization algorithm. In order to find out the optimal value, the fitness function is newly formulated with the aid of Epsilon parameter. Then, the proposed algorithm exploits the new fitness in which the new solution is generated by adjusting the step size adaptively. Finally, the proposed algorithm obtains the best solution where the data is transmitted without congestion. The experimental results and performance is analysed using MATLAB implementation by throughput and sending rate. The performance outcome of proposed algorithm attains 0.99 high throughput value and 0.1 sending rates to enhance the transmission efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptive Cuckoo Search; congestion level; Epsilon constraint; Sending rate; WSN network","Adaptive control systems; Internet of things; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Congestion avoidance; Congestion level; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Epsilon constraint; Optimization algorithms; Sending rate; Transmission efficiency; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032433,,,"English","Proc.

Energy efficiency and bit error rate (BER) performance are the basic criteria to be taken into account while designing an optimal error correction scheme for WSNs. In this paper, a novel energy efficient error control scheme is proposed which minimizes the energy overheads of a typical error control scheme such as additional bits’ transmit energy and encoding/decoding energy, while achieving a better BER performance compared to the standard schemes. The redundant bits’ transmit energy is saved by incorporating compression and coding energy is minimized by employing simpler operations compared to other schemes. Further,the proposed scheme is validated in the context of mica2 motes. The BER performance and energy consumption of the presented scheme are studied and compared with standard error control schemes,such as, Hamming (7, 4) and RS (31, 29). Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology yielding a coding gain (CG) of 4.093 dB with a parameter selection of {30, 7, 2, 5}, in AWGN channel at BER of 10 - 5, as compared to CG of 0.561 dB and 1.485 dB obtained using Hamming (7, 4) and RS (31, 29), respectively.

However, in a hierarchical cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving and aggregating the data from their member sensor nodes and transmitting the aggregated data to the base station. Therefore, the proper selection of CHs plays vital role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient cluster head selection algorithm which is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) called PSO-ECHS. The algorithm is developed with an efficient scheme of particle encoding and fitness function. For the energy efficiency of the proposed PSO approach, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. We also present cluster formation in which non-cluster head sensor nodes join their CHs based on derived weight function. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs, varying number of sensor nodes and the CHs. The results are compared with some existing algorithms to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CH-selection; Energy consumption; NP-hard; Particle swarm optimization; Wireless sensor networks","Algorithms; Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; CH-selection; Cluster formations; Cluster-head selections; Efficient schemes; Fitness functions; Hierarchical clusters; NP-hard; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Rao, P.C.S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: vasu.piit@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964318544

To facilitate ease of deployment and keeping the cost to a minimum we focus on devising a target tracking system based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We adopt a model based approach in which the targets are assumed to evolve in time according to a certain maneuver model and the deployed sensors record RSSI measurements governed by an appropriate observation model. To devise an accurate target tracking algorithm, that would account for the radio environment, we use mixed maximum likelihood (ML)-Bayesian framework. Under this framework the radio environment is estimated using the ML approach and the target tracking is accomplished using a Bayesian filtering technique namely, particle filtering. Next to create a distributed tracking algorithm which warrants that every sensor node has access to RSSI measurements of all the other sensor nodes we introduce a dissemination mechanism for the same based on the technique of random linear network coding (RLNC). In this technique every sensor node encodes RSSI measurements that it has received from other nodes (including its own) to create a network coded packet, which in turn is transmitted using the carrier-sense multiple access based access mechanism. Our simulation results demonstrate that the root mean square tracking error (RMSE) obtained by using RLNC is strictly lower than what was achieved with a competing scheme based on localized aggregation. This can be attributed to the rapid dissemination capability of the RLNC technique. Further, the growth of RMSE in a strongly connected network with noise variance was found to be much slower than in the case of a weakly connected network. This points to the potential of RLNC in improving tracking performance, especially in strongly connected networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bayesian filtering and EM algorithm; Network coding; Wireless sensor networks","Bayesian networks; Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Clutter (information theory); Codes (symbols); Linear networks; Maximum likelihood; Sensor nodes; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Distributed tracking; EM algorithms; Random Linear Network Coding; Received signal strength indicators; Root mean square tracking error; Target tracking algorithm; Target tracking systems; Weakly connected networks; Network coding","Pillutla, L.S.; Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Post Bag 4, Near Indroda Circle, India; email: laxminarayana_pillutla@daiict.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014290894

The frequent faults and failures sometime create large holes causing loss of sensing and connectivity coverage in the network. In present work, a zone based failure detection and recovery scheme is presented to reliably handle such node failures. We first propose a consensus and agreement based approach to elect a suitable monitor node called as zone monitor (ZM). ZM is responsible for coordinating failure recovery activities and maintaining desired coverage within a zone. In order to overcome failure overhead due to false failure detection, a consensus is carried out amongst neighboring nodes of a suspicious node to confirm the correct status with high accuracy. On confirmation of a node failure, the impact of resulting hole on coverage is analyzed and if impact exceeds beyond a particular threshold, a recovery process is initiated. The recovery process utilizes backup nodes having overlapping sensing coverage with failed node and may also relocate some nodes. Firstly a backup node is probed and activated if available. If no backup node is found, the solution strives to recover coverage jointly by recursively relocating some mobile nodes and probing backup nodes. The proposed scheme is analyzed and validated through NS-2 based simulation experiments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Connectivity; Coverage; Failure diagnosis; Failure recovery; Wireless sensor network","Computer system recovery; Distributed computer systems; Recovery; Sensor nodes; Connectivity; Connectivity coverages; Coverage; Failure detection; Failure detection and recoveries; Failure Diagnosis; Failure recovery; Neighboring nodes; Wireless sensor networks","Sharma, K.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kpsharma17vce@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968638573

Recently, the network structure changes rapidly in modern applications and imposes priority for heterogeneous flows which may change dynamically to fulfill the end-user requirement. In some scenarios, the priorities of the flows need to change in middle of the communication. However the major problem is that the packets of different applications are not served in the destination by their expected priority ratio even if the priority does not change. Considering the above problem, this paper presents a fair packet scheduling policy which collects information from each individual flow according to its priority and auto-updates the priorities of flows when required. The presented work focuses on the prioritized packet scheduling policy with the help of multiple queues, whose lengths are determined by priority of each application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to consider a scenario where change in priority of flow occurs dynamically. The proposed protocol has been simulated using NS2 for two applications, where each application carries multiple flows. The simulation result shows the internal buffer queues are occupied and transmitted by their respective packets according to their priority ratio. Moreover, it reduces overall packet loss which leads to serve more packets at destination than the existing fairness protocols and the packet service rate reflects instantly soon after the priority changes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Active queue monitoring; Ad hoc networks; Fairness; Packet scheduling; Transmission control protocol","Ad hoc networks; Internet protocols; Queueing theory; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Transmission control protocol; Active queue; Ad-hoc sensor networks; End user requirements; Fairness; Fairness protocols; Modern applications; Network structure change; Packet scheduling; Packet networks","Mishra, T.K.; National Institute of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: tapas@cse.ism.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020060405

The most important need for WSNs is energy efficient routing protocol that consumes optimal energy. It provides extension to the network’s life period. Nowadays a number of energy efficient routing protocols are proposed by various researchers in WSNs. However, security and energy efficiency in data collection and transmission in WSNs should be simultaneously considered for security challenges and to overcome limitation of WSNs. In this paper, we propose a new and effective routing protocol named, “Intelligent Energy Aware Secured Algorithm for Routing (IEASAR)” which is secure by using a Trust based approach and is Energy efficient at the same time. For this purpose, a new energy efficient protocol using Fuzzy C-means has been proposed in this paper. Moreover, a modified minimum spanning tree approach is applied here to identify the minimum distance path between the sender node and the destination node and hence an optimal and secured routing path is selected. Extensive simulations have been conducted in this work to verify the validity of our claims. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy Aware; Fuzzy C-means clustering; Network lifetime; Secured routing and IEASAR; WSNs","Energy efficiency; Fuzzy systems; Network routing; Power management; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Energy aware; Fuzzy C means clustering; Network lifetime; Secured Routing; WSNs; Power management (telecommunication)","Sairamesh, L.; Department of Information Science and Technology, CEG Campus, Anna UniversityIndia; email: sairamesh.ist@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019761274

Designing energy-aware routing protocol can significantly reduce energy consumption in WSNs. Grouping of sensor nodes into clusters is a proficient routing technique for reducing the energy depletion of the nodes in the WSN. In this work, a novel multi-branch tree based clustering approach is proposed to extend the lifetime of the WSNs. A number of branches and selection of cluster heads are performed based on the independent neighbour set properties of nodes. For this, a maximum of five branches constructed by the algorithm and these branches are grown to different direction using the nature of INS. In this approach, inter-cluster communication distance is drastically minimized and evenly distributed the energy consumption of nodes over the network.

In this standpoint, we propose two perspectives for diagnosing and alleviating anomalies. The first view depicts input space partitioning by subtractive clustering method with robust density measure. Later, Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference model is applied for selection of several parameters and its membership functions, and rule-based construction is practiced to spot anomalies in distributed clustering wireless sensor network.

Hence, the network consumes more energy which is the main and challenging issue in WSNs. Since the sensor is operating under battery, recharging is impossible and hence the lifetime of each sensor is an important issue. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new and efficient techniques to extend the network lifetime. In this paper, a new delay constrained energy efficient routing technique is proposed for performing effective routing in WSNs. This approach introduces a delay constraint based reliable routing approach which reduces the energy consumption by constructing efficient clusters without increasing the end-to-end delay. Moreover, the proposed technique called the rule based clustering for routing model provides better performance in terms of network lifetime than the other existing techniques since they consume more energy during the formation of clusters and finding the shortest path. Moreover, additional overhead on the cluster head selection is tackled also using rules in this proposed model in an efficient manner by building balanced clusters. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it extends the lifetime of the network and increases the throughput, energy efficiency, link quality and scalability. The experimental verification of this technique has been carried out using MATLAB simulations and proved that this model increases the packet delivery rate, network performance and reduces the delay and energy consumption. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cluster head; Data gathering; Depth First Search routing; Energy efficiency; TED based clustering; Wireless sensor network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Based clustering; Cluster head; Cluster-head selections; Constrained energy; Data gathering; Depth first search; Experimental verification; Matlab simulations; Wireless sensor networks","Velvizhy, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University, CEG Campus, India; email: velvizhy@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029789284

But like other wireless networks WSN is also prone to adversary interventions. So the researchers are addressing this issue to make routing protocols secure for communication. But due to the severe resource constraints on sensor nodes like limited battery life and limited storage capacity prevents the traditional complex security mechanisms to be employed on the sensor nodes. In this paper we propose a new routing algorithm called Secure Energy Aware Multipath Routing with Key Management (SEAM-KM) in Wireless Sensor Network. This protocol focuses on using a base station as the central control block for all kinds of computation like shortest path selection, routing table generation, Updating the routing table and distribution of pair wise keys among the sensor nodes and the base station. Leaving the energy consuming computations to be performed by the base station, the lifetime of the sensor nodes can be prolonged. Moreover distribution of pair wise keys among sensor nodes provides security among sensor nodes and also increases the resilience of the network. This protocol is resistive to some of the specific attacks which rely on forming attractive routes to lure the sensor nodes to communicate through the already compromised nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","Dijkstra's algorithm; Energy efficiency; Key Management; Multipath routing; Security","Base stations; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Network security; Power management; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; Critical environment; Dijkstra's algorithms; Key management; Multi path routing; Resource Constraint; Security; Security mechanism; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

This WBAN is a network with a special purpose that has been designed for operating in an autonomous manner and connect the various medical sensors as well as the appliances that are located inside and also outside the human body.

Hybrid energy-efficient distributed (HEED) protocol is one of the prominent clustering protocol in WSNs. However, it has few shortcomings, i.e., cluster heads (CHs) variation in consecutive rounds, more work load on CHs, uneven energy dissipation by sensor nodes, and formation of hot spots in network. By resolving these issues, one can enhance HEED capabilities to a greater extent. We have designed variants of Optimized HEED (OHEED) protocols named as HEED-1 Tier chaining (HEED1TC), HEED-2 Tier chaining (HEED2TC), ICHB-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICOH1TC), ICHB-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICOH2TC), ICHB-FL-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICFLOH1TC), and ICHB-FL-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICFLOH2TC) protocols. In HEED1TC and HEED2TC protocols, we have used chain-based intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication in HEED, respectively, for even load balancing among sensor nodes and to avoid more work load on CHs. Furthermore, for appropriate cluster formation, minimizing CHs variation in consecutive rounds and reducing complex uncertainties, we have used bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA)-inspired proposed intelligent CH selection based on BFOA (ICHB) algorithm for CH selection in ICOH1TC and ICOH2TC protocols.

With the popularity of the Internet of Things in recent years, source privacy protection has attracted a lot of attentions. In order to mitigate this threat, many proposals show their merits. However, they fail to get the tradeoff between multi-path transmission and transmission cost. In this paper, we propose a constrained random routing mechanism, which can constantly change routing next-hop instead of a relative fixed route so that attackers cannot analyze routing and trace back to source nodes. First, we design a specific selection domain which is located around the sending node according to the dangerous distance and the wireless communication range. Then sending nodes calculate the selected weights of the candidate nodes according to their offset angles in this domain. Finally, the selected weights help to decide which node will become the next hop. In this way, attackers would be confused by the constantly changing paths. The simulation results prove that our proposal can achieve high routing efficiency in multi-path transmission, while only introducing a controllable energy consumption, end-to-end delay and redundant paths. © 2013 IEEE.","offset angle; probability; source privacy protection; Wireless sensor networks","Energy utilization; Probability; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Internet of thing (IoTs); Multi-path transmission; Offset angle; Routing efficiency; Source privacies; Transmission costs; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Hu, G.; Shenzhen Institute of Information TechnologyChina; email: hugw@sziit.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030321687

In clustered WSNs, network is partitioned into set of clusters, each having a coordinator called cluster head (CH), which collects data from its cluster members and forwards it to the base station (BS) via other CHs. Clustered WSNs often suffer from the hot spot problem where CHs closer to the BS die much early because of high energy consumption contributed by the data forwarding load. Such death of nodes results coverage holes in the network very early. In most applications of WSNs, coverage preservation of the target area is a primary measure of quality of service. Considering the energy limitation of sensors, most of the clustering algorithms designed for WSNs focus on energy efficiency while ignoring the coverage requirement. In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm that uses fuzzy logic to establish a trade-off between the energy efficiency and coverage requirement. This algorithm considers both energy and coverage parameters during cluster formation to maximize the coverage preservation of target area. Further, to deal with hot spot problem, it forms unequal sized clusters such that more CHs are available closer to BS to share the high data forwarding load. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is compared with some of the well-known existing algorithms under different network scenarios. The simulation results validate the superiority of our algorithm in network lifetime, coverage preservation, and energy efficiency.

A topology control scheme is proposed, in which the sink node, which acts as the leader, identifies the set of jamming affected nodes. On the other hand, the sensor nodes, which act as followers, need to decide an optimum transmission power level, while ensuring an optimal set of neighbor nodes covered. A scheme, named TC-JAM, for ensuring packet delivery ratio, while avoiding jammers and increasing network lifetime in wireless sensor networks, is proposed. In existing literatures, the sensor nodes are envisioned to be equipped with multiple interfaces, while having access for multiple channels. However, in TC-JAM, the sensor nodes have simple hardware with single interface for communication, ie, the sensor nodes have single channel for communication. Additionally, in the proposed scheme, TC-JAM, each sensor node has a provision to vary its transmission power according to the chosen strategies.

The protocol is an iterative method where at every time iteration, the node updates its state to calculate the potential factor.

However, the selection of RPs for the design of path has a significant impact on timely data collection from the network.

Large amount of data is generated from WSN and suffers from data fault, inaccuracy and inconsistency. To increase the reliability of application, several data trust management schemes are introduced to ensure the trustworthiness of data in decision making process. Apart from these schemes, in the absence of ground truth, sensor data models are used to find the trustiness of the sensor data. The data generated from the simulation of data model is used as a metric to evaluate the degree of trustiness of sensor data.

In order to maintain these metrics, the issue of finding and healing of coverage hole is closely related to these two facts and plays a vital role in the performance improvement of the network. Many works in the past explored for 2D-WSNs, but now the time has come to investigate this matter for 3D-WSNs to reach the new heights of research and technology. In this paper, different scenarios with respect to the deployment of sensor nodes or network topology with the presence of different shaped coverage holes are discussed. Not only this, to heal these perceived holes introduction of sensor nodes having sensing radius different from initial deployed sensors has been suggested which in turn outlines the development of heterogeneous sensor networks, a keen issue with respect to technology development. This deployment of sensors to constitute heterogeneous sensor networks also influences the overall network cost in terms of cost reduction with an optimum coverage level. A mathematical analysis to give a relationship between the radii of former and later deployed sensor nodes is presented in the form of theorem.

In this paper, we have modified the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to partition the network into clusters such as to ensure that the resulted clusters are both spatially efficient and are sharing equal data transmission load. Further in this paper, we have re-defined the medium access protocol for cluster heads. The proposed medium access protocol is dependent upon the data traffic at the Cluster heads. Cluster heads with high traffic are given preference to access the channel and cluster head(s) having low traffic are made to wait for comparatively higher back-off time. By giving more time to cluster heads with lower initial data to collect more data, energy efficiency of the system is increased and contention losses are decreased due to reduction in number of transmissions between cluster heads and sink. The proposed method has been simulated and compared with LEACH protocol, a FCM based clustering protocol and Zonal based Deterministic Energy Efficient Clustering Protocol. The simulation results show that our proposed method performs better in terms of network performance parameters viz. network lifetime, energy dissipation, throughput and packet delivery ratio. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; CSMA/CA MAC; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy C Means algorithm; Multichannel access; Scalability","Carrier sense multiple access; Copying; Data acquisition; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Medium access control; Routing protocols; Scalability; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Channel access algorithms; Cluster based wireless sensor networks; Clustering; CSMA/CA; Energy Efficient clustering; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; Multichannel; Number of transmissions; Clustering algorithms","Jain, A.; Department of ECE, Ambedkar Institute of Advanced Communication Technologies and ResearchIndia; email: rtjain2001@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018670760

The paper presents planar localised Delaunay triangulation (PLDT) based algorithm for self-deployment of sensor nodes for PoI coverage and optimise the data forwarding from PoI to sink. The deployment algorithm used to cover a PoI maintains connectivity all along the deployment. PLDT provides connectivity as well as path robustness compared to relative neighbourhood graphs (RNG) based straight line deployment strategy. But PLDT based path from PoI to sink has more number of hops as against RNG based path. To minimize the number of hops a cross-layer opportunistic robust routing protocol (CORRP) is designed and been used. CORRP uses request-to-send–clear-to-send (RTS–CTS) handshaking mechanism to select a forwarder amongst the contending nodes with minimal overheads. Performance of scheme is evaluated for PoI coverage with respect to time and distance.It is observed that the scheme adequately covers the PoI in finite time. The upper and lower bound on number of hops under zero loss and network failure conditions are estimated. Compared to RNG-based straight line deployment, simulation results show that PLDT deployment with CORRP exhibits better performance in the range of 40–10% for energy consumption and 12% for packet reception approximately for increasing value of node sleeping probability. Also the energy consumption under lossy links is less by 40% compared to RNG-based straight line deployment. Thus PLDT based deployment and forwarding with CORRP exhibits improvement for energy consumption, packet reception and ensures robustness. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Mobile wireless sensor networks; Point of interest; Robust opportunistic routing","Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Delau-nay triangulations; Deployment algorithms; Deployment strategy; Mobile wireless sensor network; Neighbourhood graphs; Opportunistic routing; Point of interest; Upper and lower bounds; Wireless sensor networks","Karyakarte, M.S.; Vishwakarma Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: karyakarte.ms@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020080950

The SDP relaxation method is derived to prevaricate the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) convergence problem that will result in Lagrangian problem. Consequently, this problem can be optimally solved in a stress-free method which provides the value of multipliers. In this Relax and cut scheme, Lagrangian multiplier added in the objective function which gives the minimum value of the function that fulfills the relaxed constraints and reduce the execution time.

Invariably, in all these WSN architectures, devising suitable algorithms for the efficient network resources utilization has been a challenging task. In certain events driven scenarios, random arrival pattern of queries generation; their geographical distribution (spatial aspect) and generation rate (temporal aspect) are hard to predict precisely. However, these phenomenons could be appropriately modelled using probabilistic framework while yielding adequate accuracy. Usually, in adopted probabilistic models, the associated control parameters are treated as crisp numbers, which fail to encompass uncertainties that are inevitably associated with the modeled parameters. To include impact of such uncertainties, we propose a modified Poisson PMF expressions in that dependency on spatial and temporal aspects is incorporated based on interval concepts. The paper also validates the dynamic fuzzy c-means algorithm as the most efficient clusters formation scheme.

Localization system is required to provide position information to the nodes. Traditional localization method involves utilizing global positioning system (GPS) in all the nodes. It gives high precision, but is suitable only for outdoor environment. The energy consumption is also high. Recently, localization of each node was done using range-based and range-free techniques. Use of movable beacons to assist the nodes of a WSN in estimating their positions, has been proposed. A beacon is a node that is aware of its position (with GPS) and it will move in and around the sensor field. This beacon can be a robot. This paper gives an overview of the different localization techniques in WSN and an obstacle avoidance path planning localization algorithms, based on V Curve. This algorithm avoids the use of GPS in all sensor nodes except for the mobile beacon. And also in real-time environments, if a beacon is moving, it will be highly influenced by the obstacles. To avoid this obstacle, back-tracking technique is used. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Localization; Mobile anchor; Obstacle avoidance; Path planning; Wireless sensor network","Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global positioning system; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Localization; Localization algorithm; Localization method; Localization technique; Mobile anchors; Outdoor environment; Position information; Real-time environment; Wireless sensor networks","Magadevi, N.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Anna UniversityIndia; email: magadevin5@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028587669

These sensor nodes sense the changes in physical parameters from the sensing range and forward the information to the sink nodes or the base station. Since sensor nodes are driven with limited power batteries, prolonging the network lifetime is difficult and very expensive, especially for hostile locations. Therefore, routing protocols for WSN must strategically distribute the dissipation of energy, so as to increase the overall lifetime of the system. Current research trends from areas, such as from Internet of Things and fog computing use sensors as the source of data. Therefore, energy-efficient data routing in WSN is still a challenging task for real-Time applications. Hierarchical grid-based routing is an energy-efficient method for routing of data packets. This method divides the sensing area into grids and is advantageous in wireless sensor networks to enhance network lifetime. The network is partitioned into virtual equal-sized grids. The proposed mode-switched grid-based routing protocol for WSN selects one node per grid as the grid head. The routing path to the sink is established using grid heads. Grid heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternately. Therefore, not all grid heads take part in the routing process at the same time. This saves energy in grid heads and improves the network lifetime. The proposed method builds a routing path using each active grid head which leads to the sink. For handling the mobile sink movement, the routing path changes only for some grid head nodes which are nearer to the grid, in which the mobile sink is currently positioned. Data packets generated at any source node are routed directly through the data disseminating grid head nodes on the routing path to the sink. © 2013 IEEE.","energy efficiency; grid head; grid-based routing; mobile sink; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Grid Head; Grid-based routing; Hierarchical Grid; Internet of Things (IOT); Mobile sinks; Network lifetime; Physical parameters; Real-time application; Wireless sensor networks","Puthal, D.; Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology SydneyAustralia; email: deepak.puthal@uts.edu.au",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028722885

In such cases, it is not able to find the location due to excessive overhead. If a sensor node wants to communicate with neighbor node, geographical location of node is required. In hierarchical structure of WSN, it is very difficult to deploy the sensor node in accurate position. In previous schemes, there are several methods which were proposed to achieve location accuracy. However, it suffered from excessive overhead during localization process. In this research work, an adaptive signal strength based localization approach (ASSLA) is proposed for increasing location accuracy with node update method. In this approach, the stable paths are found with the determination of bit error rate, signal strength and packet delivery ratio. Once the paths are found, a cluster is formed with minimal hop count value. Node location update value is estimated using revised vector concept and trilateration method. From the extensive simulation results and analysis using network simulation tool (NS 2.34), the proposed approach ASSLA outperforms than existing schemes in terms of delay, location accuracy, overhead, delivery ratio, location detection efficiency. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cluster routing; Delivery ratio; Localization scheme; Node location update value; Overall delay and location detection efficiency of sensor nodes; Stable path determination; WSN","Bit error rate; Efficiency; Location; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster routing; Delivery ratio; Localization schemes; Location detection; Node location; Stable path determination; Sensor nodes","Kiruthiga, G.; Karpagam UniversityIndia; email: kiruthiga_g532@rediffmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027530304

In this paper, we study RS-TDMA and TS-TDMA in the presence of distance dependent propagation delay deviation, which is one of the most important parameters for underwater wireless ad hoc networks. First we analyze RS-TDMA and TS-TDMA using discrete time Markov chain in the presence of distance dependent propagation delay deviation. Further we find the optimum parameters to get the maximum frame utilization and compare RS-TDMA and TS-TDMA with respect to arrival rate, transmission range, distance dependent propagation delay variability constant and slot size.

Underwater Smart things are deployed to facilitate the discovery of unexplored regions of ocean. Unique characteristics of underwater wireless sensor networks pose many constraints in transmission of data packets and energy efficient routing is one of them. Motivated by the significance of less costly energy efficient routing protocol, we propose energy efficient chain based routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks (E-CBCCP). While keeping in view the complex features of underwater dynamics, dynamic network topology and node mobility, energy of the cluster heads (CHs), relay nodes (RNs) and cluster coordinators (CCOs) has been considered during the transmission of data and role of the CHs, CCOs and RNs is changed after some time duration to maintain the load on the nodes. Distance based communication is based on the location aware nodes and can be used in monitoring domains during steady state but in dynamic state, location free communication is required therefore RN communication is based on hop to hop. Confidence level of the sensor nodes is computed to select the optimal RN and to improve the reliability. New prototype has shown the improvement over CARP a routing protocol in terms of data packets transmission and energy. Simulations in MATLAB validate our methodology which has decreased the communication cost of sensor nodes and hence prolonged the network lifetime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chain Based routing protocol; Energy efficient communication; Relay node election algorithm; UWSNs","Chains; Complex networks; Data transfer; Internet protocols; MATLAB; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Dynamic network topology; Election algorithms; Energy efficient communications; Energy efficient routing; Energy efficient routing protocol; Internet of underwater things; Underwater wireless sensor networks; UWSNs; Energy efficiency","Rani, S.; Research Scholar, Department of Computer Applications, IKG Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: shalli@ssdwit.org",,"Academic Press",10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011031849

Node capture is one of the prominent attack in such networks. Whenever, a node is captured, its keys have to be revoked from the network by means of rekeying. We aim to optimize the problem of key revocation and rekeying by reducing the communication and computation overhead. An attack algorithm is presented from an adversarial view point, compromising of capturing cost and traveling cost. It is used to compute the destructive rank of each node which ultimately finds the set of vulnerable nodes of the network. Each communicating node determine a backup key for future node revocation and automatically switches to it, to avoid the reconfiguration of the shared key. The keys of vulnerable nodes are bypassed during the generation of the backup link keys. It is shown that proposed scheme has high level of security as well as reduced communication overhead during rekeying process. The proposed attack is also compared with random attack and found that it is improved in terms of route compromise ratio and energy cost. © 2017 IEEE.","Node capture attack; Node revocation; Random key predistribution; Rekeying","Cost reduction; Costs; Wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Computation overheads; Key revocation; Node capture attack; Node revocation; Random key distribution; Random key predistribution; Re-keying; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047086,,,"English","Int.

Therefore, for efficient routing, some of the nodes are selected to form a virtual backbone. Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) can be used as a virtual backbone. However, MCDS construction is an NP-Hard problem. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed greedy approximation algorithm for CDS construction which reduces the CDS size effectively. The proposed method constructs the CDSs of smaller sizes with lower construction cost in comparison to existing CDS construction algorithms for both uniform and random distribution of nodes. The performance ratio of the proposed algorithm, which is the best at the current moment, is (4.8+ln5)|opt|+1.2 where |opt| is the size of an optimal CDS of the network. Its time complexity is O(D) where D is the diameter of the network. Its message complexity is O(nR) which is linear, where n is the network size and R is the maximum between number of rounds needed to construct the PDS and number of rounds needed to interconnect the PDS nodes.

As energy becomes a quite challenging issue in these networks, clustering protocols are employed to deal with this problem. One of the main research areas in cluster-based routing protocols is fair distribution and balancing the overall energy consumption in the WSN, by selecting the most suitable cluster heads (CHs). In order to reduce the energy consumption and enhancing the CHs selection process a new routing protocol based on fuzzy logic has been proposed. There exist several algorithms based of fuzzy logic to select the most proper CHs for the network. But these algorithms do not consider all the important parameters and information of the sensor nodes in order to guarantee the optimal selection of the CHs. In The proposed algorithm, a two-step fuzzy logic system is used to select the appropriate CHs. The selection of CHs is based on six descriptors; residual energy, density, distance to base station, vulnerability index, centrality and distance between CHs. The result of the simulation indicates that, the proposed algorithm performs better comparing with some other similar approaches in case of fair distribution and balancing of the overall energy consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cluster heads selection; Clustering protocols; Energy; Fuzzy logic; WSNs","Algorithms; Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Reconfigurable hardware; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster head; Clustering protocol; Energy; Resource restrictions; Vulnerability index; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Fuzzy logic","Tamandani, Y.K.; Department of Computer Science, Aligarh Muslim UniversityIndia; email: Yahya.kord@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964008632

Due to the wide variety of WSN applications, there is a need for protocol solutions optimized for specific application classes. JRAM is proposed for WSNs deployed for monitoring multiple events in the same geographic region which require prompt detection and response. In existing contention-based synchronous MAC protocols designed for this, a node gets only one chance to succeed in data transmission scheduling per cycle, and a sink can also only receive data packets from at most one node in a cycle. Therefore, end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD) and packet delivery ratio (PDR) of these protocols drastically degrade with the increase in event occurrence rate (EOR). In contrast, JRAM proposes a novel approach to provide {k (k >1) chances to a node to succeed in data transmission scheduling in a cycle, and also allows a sink to receive data packets from k nodes in the same cycle. This is done, in JRAM, by partitioning the network nodes into k disjoint sets and then using a novel cycle structure. We evaluate JRAM through extensive NS-2.35 simulations and compare its performance with existing pipelined data collection (PDC), adaptive data collection (ADC), and CROPMAC protocols, for different types of traffic loads and traffic patterns. Results suggest that in case of high EOR, JRAM outperforms PDC, ADC and CROPMAC both in terms of the E2ETD and the PDR. © 2014 IEEE.","Energy-efficiency; medium access control (MAC) protocols; routing protocols; transmission delay; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Access control; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Network routing; Oil well flooding; Routing protocols; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Data transmission scheduling; End-to-end transmission; Many-to-one communications; Medium access control protocols; Packet delivery ratio; Transmission delays; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wsn applications; Wireless sensor networks","Singh, R.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: s.ripudaman@iitg.ernet.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23274662,,,,"English","IEEE Internet Things J.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023196570

Low power consumption, acceptable bit error rate and minimal complexity are three critical factors for UWA sensor network design. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is an attractive option because of its robustness against frequency selective underwater channel. But, OFDMA suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and high sensitivity to frequency offsets. Single carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) has not been well investigated over UWA channel in literature. Two variants of SC-FDMA namely interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) and localized FDMA (LFDMA) are considered here. Firstly, through simulation it has been observed that IFDMA performs significantly better than OFDMA, in terms of SER and PAPR. However, IFDMA outperforms LFDMA in terms of PAPR, but SER performance of IFDMA is poor as compared to that of LFDMA. In case of power limited uplink UWA communication, IFDMA serves as a feasible solution. But for downlink, where lower SER is an important performance parameter, LFDMA is an efficient multiple access scheme. The use of carrier interferometry (CI) codes with SC-FDMA further enhances the SER and PAPR performance over highly frequency selective UWA transmission. We have also evaluated the effect of multi-user diversity for CI/SC-FDMA over 5-tap frequency selective UWA channel by applying scheduling algorithm. The algorithm selects the sensor mote with best channel condition for transmission. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Multi-user diversity; OFDMA; PAPR; SC-FDMA; Scheduling; SER; Subcarrier mapping; Underwater acoustic communication","Bit error rate; Frequency allocation; Interferometry; Low power electronics; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Underwater acoustics; Multiuser diversity; OFDMA; PAPR; SC-FDMA; Subcarrier; Underwater acoustic communications; Frequency division multiple access","Trivedi, V.K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: vinay.pee14@iitp.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017148427

These restrictions make the sensor network prone to failures because most of the energy is spent on data transmission, sensing, and computing. Many applications such as habitat monitoring, military surveillance and forest fire detection expect the sensor nodes to last for a long time because they operate human unattended. Therefore, the major challenges in designing a wireless sensor network (WSN) are energy conservation, reducing data transmission delay and improving the network lifetime. In this context, data aggregation is an intelligent technique used in WSN, wherein the data from disparate sources are accumulated at intermediate nodes, thereby reducing the number of packets to be sent to the sink. Literature study shows that various routing algorithms are used to perform data aggregation based on the network topology. In order to provide an improved performance amongst the existing, a routing algorithm called cluster-chain mobile agent routing (CCMAR) is proposed in this work. It makes full use of the advantages of both low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (PEGASIS).

In WSNs, energy management and network lifetime optimization are major issues in the designing of routing protocols. Clustering is an efficient data gathering technique that effectively reduces the energy consumption by organizing nodes into groups. However, in clustering protocols, cluster heads (CHs) bear additional load for coordinating various activities within the cluster. Improper selection of CHs causes increased energy consumption and also degrades the performance of WSN. Therefore, proper CH selection and their load balancing using efficient routing protocol is a critical aspect for the long run operation of WSN. Clustering a network with proper load balancing is an NP-hard problem. To solve such problems having vast search area, optimization algorithm is the preeminent possible solution. In this paper, differential evolution based clustering algorithm for WSNs named threshold-sensitive energy-efficient delay-aware routing protocol (TEDRP), is proposed to prolong network lifetime. Dual-hop communication between CHs and BS is utilized to achieve load balancing of distant CHs and energy minimization. The paper also considers stability-aware model of TEDRP named stable TEDRP (STEDRP) with an intend to extend the stability period of the network. In STEDRP, energy aware heuristics is applied for CH selection in order to improve the stability period. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocols significantly outperform existing protocols in terms of energy consumption, system lifetime and stability period. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Boolean DE; DE; Network lifetime; Stability period; WSN","Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet protocols; Network routing; Optimization; Power management; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Boolean DE; Clustering protocol; Differential Evolution; Distributed nodes; Energy minimization; Network lifetime; Optimization algorithms; Stable clustering; Power management (telecommunication)","Mittal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh UniversityIndia; email: mittal.nitin84@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010735716

Information gathering is a typical but an important operation in many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It is necessary to operate the sensor network for longer period of time in an energy efficient manner for gathering information. One of the popular WSN protocol, named low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and its variants, aim to prolong the network lifetime using energy efficient clustering approach. These protocols increase the network lifetime at the expense of reduced stability period (the time span before the first node dies). The reduction in stability period is because of the high energy variance of nodes. Stability period is an essential aspect to preserve coverage properties of the network. Higher is the stability period, more reliable is the network. Higher energy variance of nodes leads to load unbalancing among nodes and therefore lowers the stability period. Hence, it is perpetually attractive to design clustering algorithms that provides higher stability, lower energy variance and are energy efficient. In this paper to overcome the shortcomings of existing clustering protocols, a protocol named stable energy efficient clustering protocol is proposed. It balances the load among nodes using energy-aware heuristics and hence ensures higher stability period. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms LEACH and its variants in terms of energy variance and stability period. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; DRESEP; Network lifetime; Residual energy; SEECP; WSNs","Clustering algorithms; Leaching; Low power electronics; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; DRESEP; Network lifetime; Residual energy; SEECP; WSNs; Energy efficiency","Mittal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh UniversityIndia; email: mittal.nitin84@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961588974

This paper proposes an energy efficient approach for a cluster based wireless sensor network architecture by employing the game theory and ant colony optimization technique. Initially, the proposed work forms various clusters within the network and thereafter, the coalitions are formed using the proposed algorithm based on the game theory. The proposed algorithm considers the extent of spatially correlated sensed data that are generated by neighbouring nodes in order to form a coalition within a cluster. The proposed coalition scheme reduces the number of transmissions across the network. It is compared with the competing clustering protocols. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves the increased network lifetime under the specified quality of service specification (QSS). The results of the proposed work are compared with that obtained through the existing low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and the deterministic stable election protocols (D-SEP). The overall improvement gain achieved by the proposed work is 31% and 10% at specified QSS, when compared with the LEACH and the D-SEP protocols respectively.

In MWSN, nodes move in and out of the network randomly. Hence, a path formed between two distant nodes is highly susceptible to changes due to unpredictable node movement. Also, due to the limited resources in WSN, the paths used for data transmission must be tested for the link quality and time consumed for data forwarding. In order to solve these issues, in this paper, an ant-based routing protocol with QoS-effective data collection mechanism is proposed. In this protocol, the link quality and link delay are estimated for each pair of nodes. Link quality is estimated in terms of packet reception rate, received signal strength indicator, and link quality index. A reliable path is chosen from the source to the destination based on the paths traversed by forward ants and backward ants. Then, if the link is found to be defective during data transmission, a link reinforcement technique is used to deliver the data packet at the destination successfully. The mobile robots collect the information with high data utility. In addition, each mobile robot is equipped with multiple antennas, and space division multiple access technique is then applied for effective data collection from multiple mobile robots. Simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol provides reliability by reducing the packet drop and end-to-end delay when compared to the existing protocols. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Link quality index (LQI); Mobile wireless sensor networks; Packet reception rate (PRR); Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)","Complex networks; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Mobile robots; Quality of service; Robots; Routers; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Space division multiple access; Data collection mechanism; Link quality; Mobile wireless sensor network; Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs); Multiple mobile robot; Packet Reception Rate; Received signal strength indicators; Reinforcement technique; Wireless sensor networks","Fareen Farzana, A.H.; Aalim Muhammed Salegh College of EngineeringIndia; email: fareenfarzana0902@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961216408

Based on the application scenario, the reliability of the nodes deployed has become more important for trust management evaluation. At the same time, trust management system should not be power killing, complex in terms of computation and processing capability. To convey a noticeable framework, we propose Collaborative Trust based Secure Routing protocol (CTSR) for observing direct and indirect trust values. Here we utilize two-way acknowledgement-based trust framework (2-ACKT) which requires lesser memory resources and minimizes the communication overhead. Our simulation setup for Mobile Adhoc Networks with 2-ACKT framework calculates trust value with both direct and indirect observations based on Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of uncertain reasoning approach respectively. Since the inception of DST for indirect observation in wireless networks trust values are effectively derived with data packets and control packets. The capability of DST to solve the problems with different reliability has flaws in certain areas where the nodes were subjected to disclose critical information like residual energy level and available bandwidth. And also common results derived from DST may lead to uncertain decisions. Considering all these factors we make few notable modifications in DST to enhance the security feature in 2-ACT. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-ACKT; Dempster-Shafer theory; Mobile Ad-hoc networks; Throughput","Ad hoc networks; Bandwidth; Bayesian networks; Computation theory; Formal logic; Inference engines; Military applications; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Probabilistic logics; Sensor nodes; Throughput; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; 2-ACKT; Communication overheads; Dempster-Shafer theory; Design and Development; Indirect trust values; Trust management systems; Trust-based Secure Routing; Wireless communications; Mobile ad hoc networks","Sargunavathi, S.; St Joseph’s College of Engineering, Sholinganallur, India; email: rndsargunavathi@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",1383469X,,,,"English","Mobile Networks Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015618888

This analysis put forward two different algorithms; mixed hierarchical cluster oriented routing program and hybrid hierarchical secure algorithm. A mixed hierarchal cluster based algorithm has been suggested for generating CNH and CN, for identifying the harmful node and packet is securely delivered. The source node transmits details about packet to the CN and then it chooses the pathway which is the shortest, depending upon the trust value among intermediate node and sensor node. The behavior activities of all the nodes are analyzed by the CNH, if anyone of the node’s behavior found to be incorrect, the organizer who finds the harmful node and CNH will drop those particular node behaviors.

Sensing devices had communicated in two ways: Active mode and sleep mode. In Active mode not maintaining the routing table - they provide facility to communicate the nodes on large distances. While in sleep mode, the nodes shutdown the radio to spare the vitality. In early stage, sensor nodes elected as Cluster Head and it absorb more energy; the high level of noise on the path made communication worse for the sensor devices; sensing devices get hot and has affected their overall performance at the sensor network.

Hence, resource mapping is required in a WMSN, which is based on user linguistic quality of service (QoS) requirements and available resources to offer better communication services. This paper proposes an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based resource mapping for video communications in WMSNs. Each sensor node is equipped with ANFIS, which employs three inputs (user QoS request, available node energy, and available node bandwidth) to predict the quality of the video output in terms of varying number of frames/second with either fixed or varying resolution. The sensor nodes periodically measure the available node energy and also the bandwidth. The spatial query processing in the proposed resource mapping works as follows. (i) The sink node receives the user query for some event. (ii) The sink node sends the query through an intermediate sensor node(s) and cluster head(s) in the path to an event node. A cluster head-based tree routing algorithm is used for routing. (iii) The query passes through ANFIS of intermediate sensor nodes and cluster heads, where each node predicts the quality of the video output. (iv) The event node chooses the minimum quality among all cluster heads and intermediate nodes in the path and transmits the video output. The work is simulated in different network scenarios to test the performance in terms of predicted frames/second and frame format. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed resource mapping is the first work in the area of sensor networks. The trained ANFIS predicts the output video quality in terms of number of frames/second (or H.264 video format) accurately for the given input. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","ANFIS; fuzzy inference system; query processing; resource management; resource mapping; Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Bandwidth; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Mapping; Multimedia systems; Quality of service; Query languages; Query processing; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; ANFIS; Fuzzy inference systems; Resource management; Resource mapping; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Sensor nodes","Shivappa, N.; JSS Academy of Technical Education, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Uttarahalli-kengeri Main Road, India; email: nageshashiva@gmail.com",,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",03341860,,JISYE,,"English","J Intell Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023161893

Information from physical layer adaptively changes the sleep time of the nodes. Here Sensor-MAC (S-MAC) protocol is used which uses sleep-wake cycles to improve the performance of the system. Simulations were done in NS2 and the proposed cross layer design shows a marked reduction in energy consumption of the system. © 2016 IEEE.","Cross Layer Design; Duty cycle; Energy consumption; PHY-MAC; Sensor-MAC (S-MAC); Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Computer aided software engineering; Energy utilization; Network layers; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Cross layer optimization; Cross-layer design; Duty-cycle; PHY-MAC; PHY-MAC cross-layer; Reduce energy consumption; Reducing energy consumption; Reduction in energy consumption; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

Challenge is to collect data in wsns through optimized network performance. Current researchers focus on how to minimize the energy of sensor nodes to help improve the lifetime of the node. Identifying mobile sink's moving trajectory in advance is cumbersome process in large scale WSN. We formulate a new technique - mobisink that uses Intelligent Mobility Pattern based Routing Protocol (IMPR) for efficient data collection. IMPR protocol proactively identifies trajectories based on convergent locations. Convergent location is the predominant geographical area where the sink receives the highest response from the sensor nodes. Unique aspects that distinguish the proposed approach from previous ones: 1) mobisink's - Trajectory uniqueness, enabled through convergent locations 2) Efficient Data Gathering - Success rate in data collection is enhanced through IMPR protocol. Several design factors were considered and systematically analyzed in the proposed work.

The main challenge of WSN is the distance, energy and time delay. The power resource of the sensor node is a non-rechargeable battery. Here the greater the distance between the nodes, higher the energy consumption. For having the effective transmission of data with less energy, the cluster-head approach is used. It is well known that the time delay is directly proportional to the distance between the nodes and the base station. The cluster head is selected in such a way that it is spatially closer enough to the base station as well as the sensor nodes. So, the time delay can be substantially reduced. This, in turn, the transmission speed of the data packets can be increased. Firefly algorithm is developed for maximizing the energy efficiency of network and lifetime of nodes by selecting the cluster head optimally. In this paper firefly with cyclic randomization is proposed for selecting the best cluster head.

Area coverage is one of the issues in WSN that guarantees the selected active nodes among all the deployed nodes should cover each point of the deployed area. The objective of complete area coverage is to find out redundant nodes and deactivate them, so that the remaining active nodes can cover the deployed area. Among the various existing approaches for area coverage in WSN, a grid-based approach has been proposed that provides a better way to select the active nodes or deactivate the redundant nodes from the grid rather than choosing the nodes from the deployed area. The existing approach goes with certain limitations such as how many numbers of grids need to be made in a certain deployed area with a certain number of nodes and how much percentage of nodes need to be selected from each grid. In order to avoid these limitations, in this paper, we propose a randomized grid-based approach that splits the intended area into small grids depending upon the density of nodes in a different location of the deployed area. At the same time, rather than selecting a certain percentage of nodes from each grid, here we select only one node from each grid and repeat the process till selected nodes satisfy the whole area coverage. Matlab simulator is used to study the simulation results of the proposed work, and it is found that the proposed randomized grid-based approach outperforms the existing grid-based approach both with respect to energy as well as throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","Area coverage; Voronoi; Wireless Sensor Network","MATLAB; Wireless sensor networks; Active node; Area coverages; Grid-based approach; Intermediate node; Matlab simulators; Redundant nodes; Voronoi; Sensor nodes",,"PadmaSai Y.Garg D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015603,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It is projected that by 2020 the number of connected devices is estimated to grow exponentially to 50 billion. The growing interest for the Internet of Things is contributing to the large-scale deployment of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). These networks support communications amongst sensor devices from the real world and their interconnection to the Internet. An open standard routing protocol called RPL has been specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in order to address the specific properties and constraints of these networks. However, this protocol is exposed to a large variety of attacks. Their consequences can be quite significant in terms of network performance and resources It is apparent that security will pose a fundamental enabling factor for the successful deployment and use of most IoT applications and in particular secure routing among IoT sensor nodes thus, mechanisms need to be designed to provide secure routing communications for devices enabled by the IoT.

In WSNs, the network is partitioned into several numbers of clusters of same or different size. In each cluster, a cluster head is selected. Some cluster heads are located nearer to the sink node and some are far away from the sink node. The cluster head distance from the sink node may probably influence the quality of data transmission and consume energy in high rate, which causes earlier death of cluster head. To reduce this problem, an informed search algorithm ModLeach-A is proposed.

The localization algorithms or techniques can be categorized into two: range-based and range-free. The range-free scheme uses the connectivity information between nodes. In the range-free scheme, nodes that are aware of their location are called anchors, while others that are not are called normal nodes. Anchors are fixed nodes, while the normal nodes are generally mobile. For estimation of their positions, the normal nodes initially gather the information of the positions of anchors as well as their connection, and then calculates its own positions. When compared with range-based techniques, the range-free techniques are more cost-effective, since no additional devices are required. As a result, this paper focuses on the study of two range-free localisation techniques namely, Approximate Point in Triangulation (APIT) and DV-Hop. Thus, we are interested in the investigation of wireless sensor networks on application of these two techniques under varying conditions and parameters. © 2017 IEEE.","APIT; DV-Hop; Localisation; WSN","Cost effectiveness; Sensor nodes; Surveying; Triangulation; APIT; Comparative analysis; Connectivity information; DV-Hop; Environmental Monitoring; Localisation; Localization algorithm; Localization problems; Wireless sensor networks",,"PadmaSai Y.Garg D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015603,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

These sensor nodes used to deploy in the hostile or unattended areas to sense and monitor the atmospheric situations such as motion, pressure, sound, temperature and vibration etc. The sensor nodes have low energy and low computing power, any security scheme for wireless sensor network must not be computationally complex and it should be efficient. In this paper we introduced a secure routing protocol for WSNs, which is able to prevent the network from DDoS attack. In our methodology we scan the infected nodes using the proposed algorithm and block that node from any further activities in the network. To protect the network we use intrusion prevention scheme, where specific nodes of the network acts as IPS node. These nodes operate in their radio range for the region of the network and scan the neighbors regularly. When the IPS node find a misbehavior node which is involves in frequent message passing other than UDP and TCP messages, IPS node blocks the infected node and also send the information to all genuine sender nodes to change their routes. All simulation work has been done using NS 2.35. After simulation the proposed scheme gives feasible results to protect the network against DDoS attack. The performance parameters have been improved after applying the security mechanism on an infected network. © 2017 IEEE.","DDoS attack; intrusion; IPS; security Algorithm; sink node; WSNs","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Denial-of-service attack; Low power electronics; Mercury (metal); Message passing; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Uninterruptible power systems; Wireless sensor networks; DDoS Attack; intrusion; Security algorithm; Sink nodes; WSNs; Network security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062188,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These nodes are intelligent of sensing and monitoring the environmental or physical condition like temperature, sound, pressure, motion, etc. and communicating with other nodes. Sensor nodes in WSN have limited power and energy constraint hence it becomes necessary to efficiently use these resources. Energy consumption is the major problem of WSN to overcome this problem there are many solutions introduced, it consists flat, hierarchical and location based routing. The basic hierarchical routing protocol for WSN is Low Energy Adaptive clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). LEACH works in two different phases viz. set-up and steady-state phase. LEACH periodically do the rotations among cluster-head nodes in such a way that every node gets a chance to become cluster head and distributes energy consumption between the nodes in the network which reduces the power utilization, increasing the lifetime of the network. In this paper detail working of LEACH is discussed using Omnet++ simulator. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy consumption; LEACH; Wireless sensor network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Leaching; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head nodes; Energy constraint; Energy efficient routing protocol; Hierarchical routing protocol; Location based routing; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Physical conditions; Steady state; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052974,,,"English","Proc.

In Iterative filtering algorithm (IF) the data is aggregated concurrently from multiple sources & IF also render trust assessment of these sources.

The correctness of these methods are validated through simulation study only. We propose a method to solve the original network localization problem with noisy distance measurements without any modification of constraints in the model. Using the nonlinear Lagrangian technique for non-convex optimization, we convert the problem to a root finding problem of a single variable continuous function.

For load balancing and efficient data collection in the network, clustering is used. Sensors in each cluster send the data to their corresponding cluster heads. The cluster head performs data aggregation and transmission of the aggregated data to the base station. Farther sensor nodes data are aggregated by cluster heads and send to the base station. This leads to a heavy traffic and faster depletion of energy to the nodes that are nearer to the sink. To enhance the energy conservation, for suppressing hot spot problem and for load balance achievement, we propose an algorithm namely as ECUCF (Energy Conserved Unequal Clusters with Fuzzy logic). Based on the distances of the nodes from the base station, the network is divided into three different sectors. For designing unequal clusters in each sector, a fuzzy logic approach is followed. The cluster heads that are nearer to the base station are designed to be of smaller sizes whereas the cluster heads that are situated farther away from the sink to have higher cluster sizes. The proposed algorithm ECUCF is simulated using MATLAB environment. The performances obtained are compared with the performances of other clustering schemes like LEACH (equal clustering algorithm) and FBUC (unequal clustering algorithm). From the simulated results, it is found that the performances of ECUCF are much improved as compared to LEACH and FBUC in maximizing the number of clusters, increasing the number of live nodes in the network and extending the lifetime of nodes on each round of operation. © 2017 IEEE.","Cluster; Competition radius; Fuzzy logic; Prime-CH; Residual energy; Unequal clustering","Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Leaching; MATLAB; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Fuzzy logic approach; MATLAB environment; Number of clusters; Prime-CH; Research challenges; Residual energy; Unequal clustering; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062201,,,"English","Proc.

Many drowning prevention systems have been proposed however they are not suitable for implementation at sea level. Our target to abide a cryptogram lapse prevents drowning at the beaches. Two sensors namely oxygen sensor and water detector are used. Water detectors are placed in the locket. This is suitable for people who play at the shore; who don't go deep into beaches. If a person gets pulled into the sea by the waves, the water detector in their locket will be submerged completely and if the detector continues to remain submerged then an alarm is triggered through which the coast guards are alerted. Oxygen sensor used for swimmers and is placed in the armbands of the swimmer. Oxygen level in the sea and the oxygen level in the atmosphere vary drastically. If a swimmer is about to drown the oxygen level will constantly be around 80 per cent (which is the normal oxygen residue in the sea); Then the sensor triggers a floating aide and simultaneously alerts the coast guards. An underwater network is deployed with a modem at each network node. The sensors communicate with these nodes. Similarly, sensors are placed on the seabed to indicate sudden increase in depth.

It increases the consumption of energy among the nodes. In our scheme, the encrypted content of the data is shared without revealing the data and key to other nodes by using simple technique. It preserves the key and data from an adversary with less computational and communication overhead. The base station can identify the distrustful groups related to the set of group aggregates and the retransmission of data is performed only for the abnormal data sensing intermediate nodes.

UWSNs need energy efficient designing approach, because underwater sensor nodes are battery driven. Also the deployed batteries cannot be easily recharged by non-conventional energy resources, like solar energies. Clustering is an effective technique to design an energy efficient UWSNs. Due to the sparse deployment of nodes and dynamic nature of the channel, the clustering characteristics of UWSNs are different from those of terrestrial wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we focused on optimal clustering for UWSNs which are compliant with any one of the acoustic, free space optical (FSO) and electromagnetic (EM) wave-based communication techniques. Besides, we proposed an energy dissipation model of sensor node for FSO and EM wave-based communication and compared with the contemporary energy dissipation model for acoustic-based communication.

Each nodes are self-organized, having the capacity of sense, process, and aggregate data. Energy utilization in WSN is major issue in networks for improving network lifetime. Conventional clustering schemes are created with static cluster heads that die past than the normal nodes that degrade the network performance in routing. It is very vital area to develop an energy aware clustering protocol in WSN to reduce energy consumption for increasing network life time. In this paper, a Energy Aware Clustering using Neuro-fuzzy approach (EACNF) is proposed to form finest and energy aware clusters. The proposed scheme consists of fuzzy subsystem and neural network system that achieved energy efficiency in forming clusters and cluster heads in WSN. EACNF used neural network that provide effective training set related to energy and density of all nodes to estimate the expected energy for Uncertain cluster heads. Sensor nodes with higher energy are trained with various location of base station to select energy aware cluster heads. Fuzzy if–then mapping rule is used in fuzzy logic part that inputs to form clusters and cluster heads. EACNF is designed for WSN that handling Trust factor for security to the network. EACNF used three metric such as transmission range, residual energy and Trust factor for improving network life time.

However, in some occasions, a sensor node required to move in the sensor networks. The node has to change its own position with the requirement of applications. Considering this phenomena, in this paper, we propose to design an angular function and private key management system authenticated by group leader for the transmission of a node. In the proposed scheme, the group is divided into sectors. The motion of the node is related with the angles to the group leader, which is the basis of our proposal. The nodes movement and activity should be tracked. The proposed scheme attains high connectivity and security with the help of the directional transreceiver. The lifetime of a node is increased, and it enables a node to move through the network and to transmit data to its neighbors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Angular movement; Cosine function; Group leader; Wireless sensor network","Cosine transforms; Energy efficiency; Wireless sensor networks; Angular movements; Cosine functions; Energy efficient; Group leaders; High connectivity; Key management schemes; Mobile wireless sensor network; Transmit data; Sensor nodes","Chella Thevar, G.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, St. Joseph’s Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kousalyaphd@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959340290

Since the estimation of collective coverage-area turns out to be computationally complex in the euclidean geometry, we represent each Euclidean circle in ℝ2 with a digital circle in ℤ2 for enabling faster computation. Based on the underlying geometric properties of digital circles, we present a novel O(n log n) centralized algorithm and O(d2log d) distributed algorithm for coverage estimation, where d denotes the maximum degree of a node. In order to further expedite the estimation procedure, we approximate each digital circle by the tightest square that encloses it as well as by the largest square inscribed within it. Such approximation allows us to estimate the coverage-area, in a much simpler way, based on the intersection-geometry of a set of axis-parallel rectangles. Our experiments with random deployment of nodes demonstrate that the proposed algorithms estimate the area coverage with a maximum error of only 1.5 percent, while reducing the computational effort significantly compared to earlier work. The technique needs only simple data structures and requires a few primitive integer operations in contrast to classical methods, which need extensive floating-point computations for exact estimation. Furthermore, for an over-deployed network, the estimation provides an almost-exact measure of the covered area. © 2017 IEEE.","Coverage estimation; digital geometry; wireless sensor networks","D region; Digital arithmetic; Geometry; Image resolution; Sensor nodes; Axis parallel rectangles; Centralized algorithms; Computational effort; Coverage estimations; Digital geometry; Estimation procedures; Floating-point computation; Geometric properties; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23327766,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

A sensor is battery-operated, unattended low-cost device with limited computing, communication and storage capabilities. Thus the network lifetime has become the key characteristic for evaluating sensor networks in an application-specific way. There are certain approaches in literature which consider the lifetime maximization problem. However, they suffer from impulsive energy hole, coverage hole and communication hole. In this paper we propose a novel Energy Efficient Connected Coverage (EECC) scheduling to maximize the lifetime of the WSN. The EECC adheres to Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as remaining energy, coverage and connectivity. In EECC the sensor which doesn't contribute to coverage will act as a relay node to reduce the burden of the sensing node. The sensing node senses the target whereas the relaying node communicates the sensory information to the sink. The EECC forms non-disjoint cover sets using remaining energy, coverage and connectivity of every sensor. The proposed EECC outperforms similar scheduling algorithms found in the literature in an energy efficient way with the short execution time. Through simulations the constancy of EECC in extending the lifetime of WSN is confirmed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient connected coverage (EECC); Lifetime maximization; Remaining energy; Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)","Energy efficiency; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Lifetime maximization; Remaining energies; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Roselin, J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Regional Office, Anna University Tirunelveli RegionIndia; email: roselin.js@auttvl.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019650892

Starting from the sink node (e.g., a base station), a ""deployment agent"" walks along the line, stops at equally spaced points (""potential"" relay locations), placing relays at some of these points, until he reaches a location at which the source node (i.e., the sensor) needs to be placed, the objective being to create a multihop wireless relay network between the source and the sink. The deployment agent decides whether to place a relay or not at each of the potential locations, depending upon the link quality measurements to the previously placed relays. In this article, we seek to design efficient deployment algorithms for this class of problems, to achieve the objective of 2-connectivity in the deployed network.We ensure multi-connectivity by allowing each node to communicate with more than one neighbouring node. By proposing a network cost objective that is additive over the deployed relays, we formulate the relay placement problem as a Markov decision process. We provide structural results for the optimal policy and evaluate the performance of the optimal policy via numerical exploration. Computation of such an optimal deployment policy requires a statistical model for radio propagation; we extract this model fromthe raw data collected via measurements in a forestlike environment.

However, its efficient design and practical implementation has not yet been achieved on mote platforms that are typical in wireless sensor network due to resource constrains. In this paper, we propose StructS-XCorr: cross-correlation via structured sparse representation, a new computing framework for ranging based on ℓ1 1 -norm minimization [1] and structured sparsity. The key idea is to compress the ranging signal samples on the mote by efficient random projections and transfer them to a central device; where a convex optimization process estimates the range by exploiting the sparse signal structure in the proposed correlation dictionary. Through theoretical validation, extensive empirical studies and experiments on an end-to-end acoustic ranging system implemented on resource limited off-the-shelf sensor nodes, we show that the proposed framework can achieve up to two orders of magnitude better performance compared to other approaches such as working on DCT domain and downsampling. Compared to the standard cross-correlation, it is able to obtain range estimates with a bias of 2-6 cm with 30 percent and approximately 100 cm with 5 percent compressed measurements. Its structured sparsity model is able to improve the ranging accuracy by 40 percent under challenging recovery conditions (such as high compression factor and low signal-to-noise ratio) by overcoming limitations due to dictionary coherence. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","compressed sensing; cross-correlation; location sensing; positioning; Ranging; sparse approximation; structured sparsity; ℓ1-norm minimization","Compressed sensing; Convex optimization; Range finding; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Tracking (position); 1-norm minimizations; Cross correlations; Location-sensing; positioning; Sparse approximations; Structured sparsities; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361233,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

End-to-end delay, power consumption, and communication cost are some of the most important metrics in a wireless sensor networks when routing from a source to a destination. Recent approaches using the swarm intelligence (SI) technique proved that the local interaction of several simple agents to meet a global goal has a significant impact on WSNs routing. In this paper, a proposed routing algorithm that has an ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm with an endocrine cooperative particle swarm optimisation algorithm (ECPSOA) is used to improve the various metrics in WSNs routing. The ACO algorithm uses mobile agents as ants to identify the most feasible and best path in a network. Additionally, the ACO algorithm helps to locate paths between two nodes in a network. In the ECPSOA, finds the best solution for a particle's position and velocity, which can enhance the capacity of global search and improve the speed of convergence and accuracy of the algorithm. This routing algorithm has an improved performance when compared with the simple ACO algorithm in terms of delay, power consumption, and communication cost.

This forces the data aggregating nodes to receive distorted, faulty or interference ridden signals, which severely affects the fidelity of data being aggregated. If such faults are not arrested at the source, interference laden transmissions or Interference-Faults pervade the entire WSN. On detection of such faults, the aggregating nodes keep demanding retransmission of data packets till interference-fault free data is successfully received and deciphered. This adversely affects the network traffic load. However, for want of information related to potentially interfering nodes, all efforts to determine an Interference-Fault Free Transmission (IFFT) data aggregation schedule have achieved very limited success. In a recent pioneering work, a Composite Interference Mapping (CIM) model to generate a comprehensive interference map for all nodes in the WSN was developed. In this paper, we use the CIM model, to generate an interference map for tree-based WSNs. We develop an IFFT-Tree algorithm that generates an IFFT aggregation schedule for all nodes in a tree structured WSN. We prove analytically that the aggregation schedule generated by IFFT-Tree algorithm is optimized and is interference-free. Two performance metrics are introduced to study the performance of the algorithm in maximizing the number of IFFT schedules and minimizing the number of time slots. The performance of the algorithm is validated through extensive simulation studies. © 2016 IEEE.","Data aggregation; Data transmission; Fault; Interference; Scheduling; WSN","Data communication systems; Faulting; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Wave interference; Data aggregation; Extensive simulations; Interference map; Interference mapping; Interference-free; Minimizing the number of; Network traffic loads; Performance metrics; Trees (mathematics)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035847,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Mainly, proposed work includes three algorithms: 1) network formation using MST, 2) data aggregation using normalization, and 3) pruning technique with multi-cast communication. Aggregation tree includes dominator nodes (DN) which perform certain operations like data aggregation, multicast communication and pruning the sub network using normalized values in the range of 0 to 1 and at lower layer i.e. Inferior nodes (IN) sense the requested information and reports to its upstream DN nodes.

Therefore, more sophisticated techniques are required to combat with network congestion. Various constrained resources of the WSN are to be taken into account while devising such mechanisms. Different approaches for congestion detection and avoidance have been introduced in the past few years. The traditional flooding and gossiping algorithm can cause loss of data. To tackle some of the issues, this paper presents a novel approach for congestion control based dynamic routing. In the proposed work, whenever the packet traversal experiences the congestion, an alternate path is computed to reroute the packets on the new path. The proposed work has three phases namely congestion detection, alternate path computation and re-routing the packets on new path. Congestion in the path can be detected based on the free space available in the buffer. Alternate path is computed based on available bandwidth, hop distance and residual energy on the path. This work is simulated using C for its effectiveness. Some of the performance parameters considered in this work are route discovery time, congestion ratio, delay etc. © 2016 IEEE.","Alternate path computation; Congestion Control; Wireless sensor network","Bandwidth; Congestion control (communication); Embedded systems; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Alternate path; Area of interest; Available bandwidth; Congestion detection; Constrained resources; Network congestions; Performance parameters; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication which can play an effective role in the monitoring of the remote areas for applications like military surveillance, seismic activity monitoring, earthquake detection and disaster relief operations etc. The nodes are randomly deployed in the sensor field for such applications because of which the density of nodes in some part of the area to be monitored will be more and other areas might be very less. Another problem is the physical access to sensor nodes in these areas is extremely challenging, so the human intervention is not easy. Thus, the replacement of nodes or recharging their batteries is practically impossible.

Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the apphcation and network architecture. There is a design trade-off between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. This paper provides method for clustering and cluster head selection to WSN to improve energy efficiency. It presents a comparison between LEACH and R-LEACH on the basis of the network lifetime.

In this work, we propose event driven data gathering and routing in UWSN. The proposed work operates in three phases namely (1) event detection, (2) data gathering, and (3) routing. The proposed scheme is as follows. Upon detection of the event in the sea bed, the elliptical structures are created at the sea bed, mid of the sea and on surface layer. The radius of the elliptical structure is directly proportional to the impact of the event. At each elliptical structure, the Elliptical structure Head (EH) are elected for data gathering. EH of respective elliptical structure gathers data locally using horizontal links and sends it to center node of the ellipse. Bottom elliptical structure center node transmits its data to the upper layer (sea mid layer), in-turn it sends to the surface layer center node and in turn center node of the surface layer sends it to the sink node.

In the boundary, a node which is near to the base station is highly responsible and loaded with more tasks. The task is aggregating data from different nodes deployed in the network and transfer the messages to the base station. A node which is not transferring the packets to the base station at boundary can be replaced by other mobile node. The replacement is done using the algorithm Mobile Node Movement to Boundary. The intension for mobile relay scheme is to support a complete transfer of messages and lifetime for sensor networks. © 2016 IEEE.","Cluster Head (CH); Mobile node; Mobile Node Movement to Boundary (MNMB); Relay void; Replacement; Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Base stations; Energy utilization; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster head; Dynamic sensor; Heterogeneous sensor networks; Mobile nodes; Mobile relays; Relay void; Replacement; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046973,,,"English","Int.

New cellular devices are equipped with powerful computing, communicating and storage facilities which will improve scalability, energy efficiency and decrease packet delay, etc. The performance metrics like coverage, enhanced target tracking and superior channel capacity can be increased by using mobile sink over a static sink in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). On the other hand Mobile Cellular Network (MCN) has technology of wide coverage area, powerful nodes and network robustness but it's deployment is expensive. Therefore, integration of MCN and WSN is the need of the hour. This integrated type of communication network minimizes the data loss which is an important challenge that occurs at medium access control (MAC) layer. Therefore Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for data flow is emerging issues which need to be solved. In this paper, we study the issues in convergence of MCN and WSN with respect to MAC layer.

Since, the sensor is a battery operated device the lifetime of each sensor is reduced. Therefore effective cluster formation and routing is needed to prevent the sensor node to die earlier. The existing approach consumes excess energy during routing. This was due to increased overhead on the cluster head that has to perform all the work. The proposed work introduces a technique named as Honey Bee Optimization that aims to reduce the energy consumption by finding an optimal route with low cost. The proposed approach is to extend the lifetime of a network and throughput and it delivers better performance than existing method in terms of the energy efficiency, link quality, and scalability.

The collection of enormous amount of homogenous sensor nodes forms the Wireless Sensor Network. These sensor nodes have restricted battery power and memory and so the limited amount of energy is considered as the major issue. To overcome this issue several mechanisms were proposed, among them clustering is a popular way which minimizes the consumption of energy in the sensor nodes and thus the life span of the Wireless Sensor Network can be increased. Grouping the sensor nodes in an energy efficient and distributed approach is considered as the important issue in clustering. Hotspots problem and energy hole problem are the problems faced by the non-distributed clustering. So in order to triumph over these issues, a Fuzzy Based Dynamic Clustering (FDC) in Wireless Sensor Network is proposed. Also a new fitness function for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed which discovers the possible cluster heads The hotspots problem and energy hole problem is overcome by the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which chooses unique radius for each cluster head thus unequal clustering is formed. A fair comparison is done between this proposed algorithm and some existing algorithms. The simulation results obtained reveals that our proposed algorithm increases the lifetime and has better energy efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.","Clustering; Energy Efficient; Fuzzy Inference System; Particle Swarm Optimization; Wireless Sensor Networks","Energy efficiency; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Internet of things; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; Clustering; Consumption of energy; Distributed approaches; Distributed clustering; Energy efficient; Energy-hole problems; Fuzzy inference systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509058884,,,"English","Int.

DECAF reduces the task termination (join) operations by aggressively increasing the scope of join operations (in a semantics preserving way), and eliminating the redundant join operations discovered on the way. Further, DECAF extends the traditional loop chunking technique to perform load-balanced chunking, at runtime, based on the number of available worker threads. This helps reduce the redundant parallel tasks at different levels of recursion. We also discuss the impact of exceptions on our techniques and extend them to handle RTP programs that may throw exceptions. We implemented DECAF in the X10v2.3 compiler and tested it over a set of benchmark kernels on two different hardwares (a 16-core Intel system and a 64-core AMD system). With respect to the base X10 compiler extended with loop-chunking of Nandivada et al. [26] (LC), DECAF achieved a geometric mean speed up of 2.14× and 2.53× on the Intel and AMD system, respectively.

The mote and network level energy consumption is evaluated, analyzed for real and emulated Zolertia Z1 motes so as to know the factors on which it depends. The mote level energy consumption is evaluated based on the amount of current drawn and the supply voltage for the time spent by the mote in processing, transmitting and receiving the packets. To ease the evaluation on per mote basis a small scale 6LoWPAN is considered. The network level energy consumption is evaluated based on the routing protocol overhead, the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) overhead, the received signal strength indication (Received Signal Strength Indication), the positions of the motes, the percentage duty cycle and various states of motes like processing, receiving and transmitting. Three major observations are drawn from the experiments and simulations; First, maximum energy is consumed at the mote level in receiving state and found to be higher than that in transmitting and processing states on an average by 10.94 and 27.24 percent respectively. Second, energy consumed at the network level depends on the composite effect of the received signal strength, average overhead bytes in control as well as in data packets, the percentage duty cycle of the motes and activities carried out by the motes in various states.

The proposed protocol considers that the communication in a clustered network is secured using a common group secret which is distributed by the respective cluster head only to the authorized nodes in the cluster. The protocol uses Chinese remainder theorem based group key broadcast to revoke the victim node and update the group key for remaining valid nodes.

In this paper we have provided a solution to detect malicious nodes which perform radio transmission power control attack and sinkhole attack in wireless sensor networks. In the proposed approach, data transmission is divided into multiple rounds of equal time duration. Each node chooses the parent node in the beginning of the round for forwarding the packet towards sink. Each node adds its identity in the packet as a routing path marker and encrypts before forwarding to parent. Child node observes the parent, handles acknowledgement from 2-hop distance node and decides the trust on parent based on successful and unsuccessful transactions. Each node sends a trust value report via multiple paths to Sink at the end of the round. Sink identifies the malicious node by comparing trust value report received from each node with number of data packets received.

Sensor nodes are deployed in region to be observed. They sense quantity of interest. It may be temperature, pressure, humidity, solar radiation and so on. The sensed readings are transferred to a central node known as sink or base station. Often networks are heterogeneous in nature i.e. more than one types of sensors are deployed in given region. In homogeneous networks, only one type of nodes are present. Once nodes are deployed, a tree is formed rooted at sink. It is difficult to achieve perfect aggregation in heterogeneous networks. Unlike homogeneous networks, nodes may have more than one types of packets coming in and going out. To maximize chances of aggregation, node should forward every packet to a parent where it can be aggregated. Thus a node may have to select more than one parents. This means that tree formation process should be done keeping heterogeneity in consideration. We have extended joint distributed scheduling and tree formation proposed in literature for heterogeneous networks. It is found that the extended algorithm maximizes aggregation, requires less number of time-slots to schedule the network and conserves energy. It is also found that scheduling heterogeneous network results in more control overhead than homogeneous network. © 2016 IEEE.","Heterogeneous networks; Sensor Networks; TDMA Scheduling","Forestry; Heterogeneous networks; Real time systems; Scheduling; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Time division multiple access; Basic application; Control overhead; Data collection; Distributed scheduling; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Homogeneous network; Quantity of interest; TDMA scheduling; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

We therefore ameliorate the channel access mechanism by introducing a new Active-Tx state, which aids in identifying the state of local gateway along with traditionally existing Sleep and CSMA/CA states. A 3D Markov chain based model is developed for analysing the performance of proposed MAC framework under different configurations of network. Upon considering reliability, energy and delay as the key performance metrics the analysis shows that the model captures behaviour of the sensor node most accurately with 95% confidence level.

In the design of any algorithm for WSN, the major constraint is limited battery life time of the sensor nodes. Most of the existing work on combined problem of coverage and connectivity either require the clocks of the nodes to be synchronized or require exact location information of the nodes to be known. In this paper, we present an Asynchronous Algorithm which is Energy Efficient and provides integrated Coverage and Connectivity, called (AAEECC). Our algorithm does not require clock synchronization of nodes at any stage neither does it require exact location information of the nodes. It is low cost, fully distributed and scalable. In the following, we discuss the approach used. First, we build a minimum hopcount graph for connectivity. Second, we propose a scheduling algorithm for providing desired coverage. Third, we define a fault tolerant connectivity maintenance algorithm (FTCM) to re-ensure connectivity as network may become disconnected due to scheduling. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Clocks; Energy efficiency; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Asynchronous algorithms; Battery life time; Clock Synchronization; Connectivity maintenance; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient coverages; Location information; Surveillance applications; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Hence, by controlling the transmission power, energy can be conserved. In this paper we implement a dynamic transmission power control scheme using PID feedback mechanism. We control the RSSI and LQI using PID mechanism with an aim of reducing the energy consumption without compromising link quality.

Among the various wireless domains, Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Networks (WDSN) pose a good support to the dynamics that arise when the nodes are induced with mobility. In the Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Network (WDSN), major consideration is on utilizing the energy efficiently among the mobile nodes. Various techniques are used to attain energy efficiency in Zigbee WDSN. Among them, clustering the nodes is one of the best methods, since they aim at reducing the energy dissipation and increasing the life span of the network. Hence, in this paper, the performance of Zigbee WDSN using clustering scheme is done by considering the nodes with mobility and compared with performance of Zigbee WDSN using non clustering technique. The proposed work is summarized as follows: the network is deployed as clusters and the remaining energy of the node is determined by utilizing clustering protocol. In each cluster, the clustering protocol opts for the node with the maximum remaining energy as the head of that cluster. Then STR algorithm is utilized to route the sensed data from the member nodes to the cluster head. Hence, the clustering technique and STR, route the information through the shortest path paving the way for enhanced average residual energy and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The simulations are done by using ns2 and performance metrics such as average residual energy and PDR are computed and analyzed for non clustered and clustered method. © 2017 IEEE.","clustering; residual energy; STR; WDSN; Zigbee","Cluster analysis; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Average residual energy; clustering; Clustering techniques; Dynamic sensor networks; Packet delivery ratio; Performance analysis; Residual energy; WDSN; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037155,,,"English","Int.

Many novel algorithms continue to be proposed to achieve this objective. A survey of the literature also suggest that uneven clustering with less nodes closer to the base station achieves greater efficiency than same number of nodes in all clusters. This is due to larger overheads for the nodes closer to the base station. This work proposes a novel K-Means L Layer algorithms which leads to the creation of clusters with lesser number of nodes closer to the base station as opposed to the ones far away from it for randomly deployed nodes.

The key parameters that play a major role in designing a protocol for WSNs are its energy efficiency and computational feasibility, as sensor nodes are resource constrained. Variation in sensor nodes distance from base station and inter node distances primarily cause unequal energy consumption among the sensor nodes. The energy consumption varies with time and causes degradation of system performance. LEACH is the first ever clustered based routing protocol which provides elegant solutions, suffers from the drawback due to the randomized cluster head (CH) election. Assuming serious energy rebalancing with traditional clustering algorithm, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based clustering algorithm which evaluates the fitness function by considering the two major parameters distance and energy has been proposed in this paper. GA is a probabilistic search based algorithm based on the principle of natural selection and evolution.

WSN have numerous design concerns out of which security is the key factor because it affects the overall performance of the network. In this paper we have evaluate PPS scheme and implement forwarding window technique. In this paper we proposed a time allocation based request forwarding window technique to detect and prevent DoS (Denial of Service) attack. DoS attacks are flooding access amount of packets in the network that consumes the energy of the network. In Profile based Protection Scheme (PPS), the behavior of all the nodes deployed in the network are observed. When the attacker floods the network with Route Request messages, the abnormal behavior of the attacker, is detected at the end. But in the Forwarding window technique the attacker is detected in route request phase and prevention will be done in route reply phase. In proposed technique, if any node floods the route request messages more than the dynamic time then it will detect as attacker. And the node which detected this, will inform the others about the ID of the malicious node. The modified route request for forwarding phase will continue until request reaches destination. The destination node will not choose the path containing the detected nodes. The performance is measured on the basis of performance metrics like total packet sent, remaining energy, throughput etc. In this, simulation results are shows that proposed work successfully detect and prevent DoS attack. © 2016 IEEE.","DoS attack; Forwarding Window Technique; Issues; PPS; Security Goal; Suspicious mechanisms; Wireless sensor network","Computer crime; Deforestation; Denial-of-service attack; Distributed computer systems; Floods; Network security; Polypropylenes; Wireless sensor networks; Dynamic forwarding; Forest fire detection; Issues; Performance metrics; Protection schemes; Remaining energies; Security goals; Window techniques; Sensor nodes",,"Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034116,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Distributed fault tolerant clustering algorithm (DFCA) for fault tolerance has a drawback as the load on neighbouring CH increase and energy consumption is more. Improved distributed fault tolerant algorithm, IDFCA technique works to reduce the energy consumption by introducing hierarchy formation process of selecting CH and it also overcome the situation of faulty node.

Cluster-based approaches are popularly used for its energy efficiency where some nodes designated as Cluster Heads (CHs) organize WSNs for data aggregation and energy saving. The CH is responsible for gathering data from the cluster nodes and conveying it to the base station due to which higher energy drain occurs at CH leading to uneven network degradation.

These types of networks have a wide range of applications including habitat monitoring, health monitoring, data acquisition in hazardous environmental conditions and military operations. Sensor nodes are resource constrained having limited communication range, battery and processing power. Sensor nodes are prone to failure and can be also physically captured by an adversary. One of the main concerns in WSNs is to provide security, especially in the cases where they are deployed for military applications and monitoring. Further, WSNs are prone to various attacks such as wormhole, sinkhole and blackhole attacks. A blackhole attack is a kind of denial of service attack, which is very difficult to detect and defend and such blackhole attack, if happens, affects the entire performance of the network. In addition, it causes high end-to-end delay and less throughput with less packet delivery ratio. The situation can be worst if multiple blackhole attacker nodes present in the network. As a result, detection and prevention of the blackhole attack becomes crucial in WSNs. In this paper, we aim to propose a new efficient group-based technique for the detection and prevention of multiple blackhole attacker nodes in WSNs. In our approach, the entire WSN is divided into several clusters and each cluster has a powerful high-end sensor node (called a cluster head), which is responsible for the detection of blackhole attacker nodes, if present, in that cluster.

In this type of attack, an adversary intelligently captures the node(s) and extracts the cryptographic information to destroy the privacy, safety and reliability of the network. We propose a novel hybrid approach for constructing the path vulnerability matrix that maximizes the attacking efficiency and lowers the resource expenditure of the adversary. The main strength of the proposed matrix lies in incorporating various criteria such as the type of application running on the nodes, capturing cost, key dominance ranking, articulation point and intersecting shortest path nodes in estimating the vulnerability. The location of the data sink is considered as a major factor in estimating the vulnerability of the nodes in the network. The proposed matrix is compared with existing attacking strategies in terms of the number of attacking rounds, energy cost and fraction of compromised traffic. Although in this paper, we have considered adversarial point of view but the proposed matrix can be extended for the defender application also. The path vulnerability matrix provides vulnerability estimation that can be used to analyze system security weakness and helps to defend against them effectively and efficiently. The performance of proposed approach has been validated with respect to average path compromise ratio, average routing path length and average route successful ratio. We have also introduced an attack resistant random key predistribution scheme based on the proposed approach and the results confirm its effectiveness in decreasing node capture impact. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Node capture attack; Random key predistribution scheme; Secure routing; Vulnerability model","Distributed computer systems; Matrix algebra; Network security; Sensor nodes; Articulation points; Attacking strategy; Average routing path; Node capture attack; Random key predistribution; Secure routing; Vulnerability matrixes; Vulnerability models; Wireless sensor networks","Ahlawat, P.; Department of Computer Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: mannpammy@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990889865

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a promising technology for delivering quality healthcare to its users. Low power devices attached to the body have limited battery life. It is desirable to have energy efficient routing protocols that maintain the required reliability value for sending the data from a given node to the sink. The current work proposes two protocols: Optimized Cost Effective and Energy Efficient Routing protocol (OCER) and Extended-OCER (E-OCER). In OCER, optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the multi-objective cost function with residual energy, link reliability and path loss as its parameters for selecting the most optimal route from a given body coordinator to the sink. Distance between any two sensor nodes is reduced by applying multi-hop approach. E-OCER extends the work of OCER by considering inter-BAN communication. Performance of OCER is compared with other existing energy aware routing protocols by considering different parameters. A comparison of the performance of E-OCER with OCER is made to study the effect of on-body sensors communication on the energy consumption and throughput of the network. This paper also provides a comprehensive energy model to calculate the total energy consumption of the network. In addition to the radio transmission and receiving energy, other basic energy consumption sources viz. processing energy, sensor sensing, transient energy and transmission/reception on/off energy have also been taken into account.

The main challenge in acoustic sensor networks is to maintain the energy level balance among the nodes, throughout the entire lifetime of the network. Hence, a Balanced Multi-objective Optimized Opportunistic Routing (BMOOR) is proposed to forward the packet through multi-hop from downstream node to upstream node, so as to reach the sink at the surface. The proposed method refashions the nodes based on the dynamic estimations with respect to energy and the selection of optimal forwarders along the depth in a three dimensional network. In contrast to the existing techniques, the proposed protocol does not require spatial location, which is very expensive in UWSN. This in turn overcomes the fear of the single node getting trapped during greedy forwarding. The proposed method is further optimized using meta-heuristic, generation based bio-inspired algorithm (Bat) for delay minimization and delivery ratio maximization. Bat algorithm optimizes the opportunistic path by random fly with respect to fitness till it converges to an optimal pareto front, thereby the network lifetime is enhanced. Extensive simulation study using NS2 with an underwater simulation package proved that BMOOR contributes significant performance improvements over other representative UASN routing protocols. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bat algorithm; Energy efficiency; Opportunistic routing; Optimization; Underwater acoustic sensor networks","Acoustic devices; Acoustic equipment; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Multiobjective optimization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Underwater acoustics; Acoustic sensor networks; Bat algorithms; Bio-inspired algorithms; Extensive simulations; Opportunistic routing; Three-dimensional networks; Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Underwater sensor networks; Optimization","Kanthimathi, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: kanthimathi.research@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978880768

The task of cluster heads collection, data aggregation and transmission to the base station is undertaken. Choosing CHs in WSN in a Non-deterministic Polynomial-hard issue because optimum data collection with effective energy conservation is not capable of being resolved in polynomial time.

In topologies of lower degree of connectivity like sparse network, these one-hop consensus synchronization algorithms have exhibited poor performance in terms of convergence speed and synchronization accuracy. This motivates the design of multi-hop consensus time synchronization algorithm for sparse WSNs.

Fast data delivery from source node to sink node is also required for many applications. Sometimes data transmission towards the sink may be interrupted because of failure of nodes in a particular area. The various such requirements of routing data in a WSN are sometimes contradictory and routing algorithms must be designed keeping in mind all these requirements. In this paper three routing algorithms are proposed for multi-sink partitioned network. In these three algorithms, the source nodes or intermediate nodes select a next node to forward the data to the destination or sink. This process repeats until the data reaches the sink. In the first technique, the next node is chosen considering its distance from sink node as a criterion. In the second technique, remaining energy of the neighboring nodes is used as a criterion for selection of the next node. The combination of these two criteria is considered in the third technique and a multiple criteria decision analysis technique is used. A recovery technique from area failure is also proposed and incorporated in the above mentioned algorithms. The algorithms are designed and implemented in multi-sink environment for partitioned wireless sensor networks. Performances of the algorithms are studied in a simulation environment and compared with other well-known algorithms to understand their effectiveness. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Multi-criteria; Multiple sink; Partitioned network; Routing; Wireless sensor network","Decision theory; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Operations research; Sensor nodes; Multi-criteria; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Multiple sinks; Partitioned networks; Recovery techniques; Remaining energies; Routing; Simulation environment; Wireless sensor networks","Rehena, Z.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Aliah University, IIA/27 New Town, India; email: zeenatrehena@yahoo.co.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990842177

Health watch is becoming popular, however securing data becomes critical as privacy issues are a major concern in wireless systems. Finding threats and blocking them without affecting the network is essential without increasing the processing overheads and energy. In this paper, a Trust Based Adaptive Acknowledgment (TRAACK) Intrusion-Detection System for WSN based on number of active successful deliveries, and Kalman filter to predict node trust is proposed. In TRAACK the entire route based trust strength for multi hop sensor networks is reverted to nodes acting as Security Agent. Based on trust value of entire route, Acknowledgement is initiated on select packets to decrease control overhead. It is observed that the packet delivery ratio for the proposed TRAACK method improves even when malicious nodes are present, the proposed technique TRAACK is able to detect malicious nodes and avoid them in the route discovery process.

Due to the distinct characteristics, they are vulnerable to many attacks. To secure WSN, trust management plays a pertinent role. In trust based security model, decision is taken based on some specific behavior, and so it has uncertainty. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty and has tolerance of imprecise data with high power of precision. In this study, fuzzy logic based multi-attribute trust model is suggested. The proposed trust model has message success rate, elapsed time at node, correctness and fairness as trust metrics. Once the four trust values are calculated, fuzzy computational theory is applied to compute the final trust value of every node that can be anyone of low (l), medium (m) and high (h).

The focus is about clock synchronization, delay measurement in time synchronization and fine grained network time synchronization. The recent advancements in the sensor technology has led to the miniaturization of the sensors and its related components, and similarly reduced the cost to a larger extent. This enabled an active rise in the research of large scale networks of sensors. The synchronization of sensor nodes is critical to its effective operation especially the time synchronization, for the data fusion, duty cycling and so on. Most of the algorithms for synchronization that were proposed recently do the same work. The server periodically sends a piece of information or message that contains the current value of clock to the client. This happens in case of time synchronization of the sensor nodes. The proper definition for sensor networks comes as follows. It is a special type of ad-hoc network, in which the nodes, also referred to ass wireless devices get together and the form a network without any need for underlying infrastructure spontaneously. They can cooperate only by forwarding packets to each other since there are no routers in an environment without any infrastructure. When the environment is distributed in nature, then more complex is the scenario. But time synchronization is an important component of such distributed environments. It aims to provide a common time for the local clocks in their network (Sivrikaya and Yener in IEEE Netw 18(4):45–50, 2004). For applications of networking protocols, at any particular instant, there should be a common view of the clock in the network. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clock time; Evolutionary computing; Quality of Service (QoS); Routing; Soft computing; Time synchronization; Wireless sensor networks (WSN)","Ad hoc networks; Clocks; Complex networks; Data fusion; Mechanical clocks; Quality of service; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Soft computing; Synchronization; Telecommunication networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Clock Synchronization; Distributed environments; Evolutionary computing; Network time-synchronization; Networking protocols; Routing; Sensor technologies; Time synchronization; Wireless sensor networks","Saravanaselvam, N.; Department of CSE, Sri Eshwar College of EngineeringIndia; email: saravanaselvam.n@sece.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974814381

Our proposed approach is powerful because it considers the effect of the nearest neighbors on the current state values and then detects the anomalous nodes based on the estimated state values. Our method can estimate the missing state values of the sensor nodes, which are kept in sleep mode for energy conservation. We also propose an alternative Bayesian model that is computationally faster for state estimation and anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated through extensive simulation studies, and the usefulness of our algorithm is numerically assessed.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive MAC-frame payload tuning mechanism for wireless body area networks (WBANs) to maximize the probability of successful packet delivery or reliability of the associated sensor nodes based on real-time situation. The enabling algorithm, Adaptively Tuned MAC (AT-MAC), has been proposed to tune the MAC-frame payload of a WBAN sensor node, which is compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. AT-MAC prioritizes sensor nodes based on the seriousness of the health parameters that are being measured by the respective sensor nodes. Further, we consider a Markov chain-based analytical approach that acknowledges the slotted CSMA/CA backoff mechanism with retry limits, as described in the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. We derive expressions for reliability, power consumption, and throughput, which are the key metrics to evaluate the network performance of the proposed protocol, and analyze the impact of MAC parameters on them. Finally, results indicate that the low rate and low power IEEE 802.15.4 can be used effectively in case of WBANs if the payload is tuned properly through the proposed algorithm.

Initially to determine the quality using RSSI and LQI indicator, an enhanced link quality estimation technique (ELQET) is designed with an intuitive combination of the Kalman filter and fuzzy logic. The quality score returned by fuzzy utilizing four efficient link metrics PRR, ASNR, ALQI, and SA is further smoothened with exponential weighted moving average filter for stability. Consequently the estimated quality is categorized into good/poor quality to stream data at high/low transmission rate respectively between the LPC2148s via CC2550 transceiver. Here, two contrasting RSSI and LQI data sets are furnished as input to ELQET and categorized into good link with quality of about 61 % and poor link with a quality of about 50 %. The straight forward low computation technique is WSN propitious and exhibits high performance with RMSE of 0.0133. The environment adaptive data streaming enhance the quality of transmission accompanied by reducing energy and data loss. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fuzzy logic; Kalman filter; Link quality estimation; Link quality indicator (LQI); Received signal strength indicator (RSSI); Wireless sensor nodes","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Data reduction; Fuzzy logic; Kalman filters; Radio transceivers; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Exponential weighted moving average; Industrial environments; Link quality estimations; Link quality indicators; Quality of Transmission; Received signal strength indicators; Reliable data transmission; Wireless sensor node; Fuzzy filters","Hemalatha, M.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Abdulaziz UniversitySaudi Arabia; email: mkhema@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988353014

To bring these paradigms to life, self-sustainable wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes capable of seamless and maintenance free operation at remote locations are desired. Recently, radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) circuits capable of harvesting RF power transmitted by base stations, TV towers and other ambient RF sources have been developed. Low power requirements and architectural compatibility between WSN nodes and RFEH circuits make RFEH a promising and feasible solution for WSN nodes. In this paper, a novel multi-stage decision-making policy (DMP) for RFEH enabled WSN nodes has been proposed. It offers an intelligence, via online learning algorithm, for characterization and selection of frequency bands based on their RF potential especially in the dynamic spectrum environment. Furthermore, proposed DMP supports multi-antenna multi-band harvesting capabilities of the RFEH circuits. The final contribution includes tunable RFEH duration that leads to significant improvement in the harvested energy and fewer number of frequency band switchings (FBS). Derived theoretical performance bounds and simulation results validate the superiority of proposed DMP in terms of the harvested RF energy and throughput of the WSN nodes. Furthermore, the fewer number of FBS makes the proposed DMP suitable for resource-constrained WSN nodes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor nodes","Decision making; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Low power electronics; Smart city; Wireless sensor networks; Architectural compatibility; Distributed decision making; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Online learning algorithms; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor node; Sensor nodes","Darak, S.J.; ECE DepartmentIndia; email: sumit@iiitd.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019889674

A wireless sensor network consists of a large number of low-cost, low-power sensor nodes that are deployed in a specific application domain to sense different environmental parameters, suitable for the intended application. Geographic routing mechanism is very much suitable for the highly energy constrained wireless sensor networks due to its less memory and computational overhead. The presence of holes can defeat the advantages of geographic routing mechanism and may even harm the objective of network deployment. This paper conducts a survey on the various types of holes, cause for their occurrence and various techniques to deal with them. The various mechanisms that are used to recover from holes tend to increase energy consumption of sensor nodes and thus affect network lifetime. Thus the survey concentrates on energy efficient mechanisms to handle holes with an aim to improve network connectivity and network lifespan that will extend the applicability of wireless sensor networks. © 2016 IEEE.","Connectivity; Holes; Network Lifetime; Wireless Sensor Networks","Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; MEMS; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Surveys; Computational overheads; Connectivity; Environmental parameter; Holes; Micro electro mechanical system; Mission critical applications; Network connectivity; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In the proposed algorithm, medical images are embedded as watermark into a special cover image.

Watermark generation and embedding is performed by modifying the transformed coefficients of watermark and cover image by varying the value of scaling factor. Finally inverse discrete cosine and discrete wavelet transforms are applied on modified sub-bands to obtain the watermarked image. Watermark extraction is done using an extraction algorithm.

To establish a session key in sensor node communication is a challenging job for WSNs. Key exchange and group key transfer protocols based on trusted key distribution center can be applied for the network infrastructures with fixed topology. But these protocols are impractical for large scale distributed mobile adhoc networks. This is mainly because of the limitation in communication range, limited battery power in sensors and unknown mobile adhoc network's physical toplology prior to deployment. The traditional key pre-distribution solutions are infeasible to practically apply in large scale mobile sensor networks.

Although, wireless sensor network is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication, we find very less development of real time applications using the sensor networks. The main reason for this is the design of the motes to be deployed in the sensor field according to the requirement of application is difficult job and expensive in terms of investment of money. Moreover, the replacement of the batteries or repairing of the devices becomes a very challenging task as the human intervention in the deployment areas is next to impossible. Hence assurance of long lived sensor nodes and prolonged network life time can be impacted by inducing adequate amount of sleep scheduling to the nodes. This paper presents a communication protocol based on optimal back-off sleep time to give a right amount of sleeping to the sensing devices in the monitoring area due to which energy efficient coverage can be achieved. The advantage of the design is that based on the unused battery, randomly the sleep duration is calculated and given to the probing node by the active node. Hence, full utilization of the active node till it dies is ensured. The life of an individual node thus increases since the time of activity of it is smartly scheduled. The blacklisting of nodes like to be faulty or fail helps to overcome problem of node failure. The simulation of the protocol, analysis of the results and further scope of the development of the proposed design is discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient performance etc; Optimal backoff sleep time","Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuits; Investments; Power management (telecommunication); Sleep research; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient coverages; Human intervention; Real-time application; Sleep time; Wireless communications; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

With more critically important applications being designed for the WSN, security becomes a matter of prime importance. Though a lot of work has been carried out in the field of security for WSN, yet providing a robust security framework remains an open research challenge. One such open research domain is prevention of node replication attack, where the adversary takes control of a node from the network and steals all the security related credentials like node identity, keys, keying mechanism etc. and generates duplicate clones of the compromised node with the same security parameters. Building a defence mechanism against such node replication attacks has become an important research topic. The design principles has given directions to more threatening and different challenges which are more difficult to detect then typical attacks that are application dependent. There are several protocols that have been documented regarding node replication attacks. However, in depth study of this protocols reveal that robust prevention mechanism against such kind of attack is debatable and several vulnerabilities exist.

Ace of the adaptive features of context-awareness is contextual reconfiguration. Contextual reconfiguration involves discovering remote service(s) based on context and binding them to the application components to realize new behaviors, which may be needed to satisfy user needs or to enrich user experience. One of the steps in the reconfiguration process involves a remote lookup to discover the service(s) based on context. This remote lookup process provides the largest contribution to reconfiguration time and this is due to fact that the remote calls are much slower than local calls. The use of cross-layer information from lower layers opens the door to developing efficient replication schemes that account of the specific features of WSNs (e.g., contention between the nodes to access the wireless medium and traffic interference). This service program enables those infrastructure nodes to participate in content distribution and act the part of replica servers. Therefore, it affects system performance. The proposed concept is the compounding of two contributions stated as: (i) A new improved routing technique is proposed, whose main destination is to get at the energy consumption balance and prolonging wireless sensor network lifetime. We prove that the public presentation of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to be within a constant divisor of the globally optimal performance, with far more benign worst case ratios than in prior employment, even in asymmetric scenarios, and (ii) Content is typically partitioned into two disjoint sets of inelastic as well as elastic content. Cooperative caching is shown to be capable to reduce content provisioning cost which heavily depends on service and pricing dependencies among various stakeholders, including content providers, network service suppliers, and end consumers. © 2016 IEEE.","Caching; Contextual Reconfiguration; Replication; WSN","Costs; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Sensor nodes; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Wireless networks; Application components; Caching; Contextual Reconfiguration; Energy consumption balances; Pervasive computing applications; Reconfiguration process; Reconfiguration time; Replication; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

Wireless sensor networks are mainly characterized by their limited amount of energy and memory. Constructing a network with this kind of sensor will lead to additional challenges with energy and memory constraints of wireless sensor network. The success of the wireless sensor network is mainly depends on maximum lifetime with high quality of services (QoS). Clustering is one of widely used technique to increase the lifetime of the network by utilizing energy in an efficient manner. In clustering each sensor node reported to it is Cluster Head (CH). Data fusion is an important QoS parameter when forming multi-model based wireless sensor networks.

The distributed nature and dynamic topology of WSN introduces very special requirements in conserving energy and providing security. To address these challenges, technique like secure and energy efficient clustering scheme with data aggregation has been developed. The comparison between LEACH, M-LEACH and the proposed scheme with result analysis is presented in this paper. In this paper, we implement energy efficient clustering scheme [1][2][4][12][15][17][19] with aggregation of information to save the bandwidth requirement, which prolongs the lifetime of a network [8]. The proposed algorithm operates in two-phases. In the first phase clustering is done, in which sensor nodes compute potential score which is based on mobility pattern, density [5] and remaining energy [5] [8] in disseminated manner, then each node decides to become a cluster head(CH), by employing potential score. In second phase, every node chooses its CH [5] which has higher potential score. All cluster members will transmits the data to cluster heads for aggregation and encryption, which is then forwarded to the base station.

Recently, mobile sink, trajectory based forwarding and energy supply based node selection have been suggested in literature for optimizing residual energy of nodes. In the most of these approaches, energy consumption has been minimized focusing on the optimization of one particular parameter. The consideration of impact of more than one parameters on energy consumption is lacking in literature. In this context, this paper proposes Huffman coding and Ant Colony Optimization based Lifetime Maximization (HA-LM) technique for randomly distributed WSNs. In particular, ACO based multiple paths exploration and Huffman based optimal path selection consider the impact of two network parameters on energy consumption. The parameters include path length in terms of hop count and residual energy in terms of load of nodes of the path and the least energy node. The construction of multiple paths from source to the sink is mathematically derived based on the concept of two types of ants; namely, Advancing Ant (A-ANT) and Regressive Ant (R-ANT) in ACO. The optimal path is identified from the available multiple paths using Huffman coding. Analytical and simulation results of HA-LM are comparatively evaluated with the state-of-the-art techniques considering four performance metrics; namely, average residual energy, energy consumption, number of alive sensors and standard deviation of energy. The comparative performance evaluation attests the superiority of the proposed technique to the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ACO; Energy consumption; Green computing; Huffman coding; Lifetime maximization; Optimization; WSNs","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Energy utilization; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Average residual energy; Green computing; Huffman coding; Lifetime maximization; State-of-the-art techniques; Trajectory based forwarding; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Wireless sensor networks","Kaiwartya, O.; Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)Malaysia; email: omprakash@utm.my",,"Springer New York LLC",19366442,,,,"English","Peer-to-Peer Netw.

The limited energy constraint of the sensor node causes a huge impact on the lifetime of the deployed network. The data transmitted by each sensor node cause significant energy consumption and it has to be efficiently used to improve the lifetime of the network. The energy consumption can be reduced significantly by incorporating mobility on a sink node. Thus the mobile data gathering can result in reduced energy consumption among all sensor nodes while transmitting their data. A special mobile sink node named as the mobile data transporter (MDT) is introduced in this paper to collect the information from the sensor nodes by visiting each of them and finally it sends them to the base station. The Data collection by the MDT is formulated as a discrete optimization problem which is termed as a data gathering tour problem. To reduce the distance traveled by the MDT during its tour, a nature-inspired heuristic discrete firefly algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally collect the data from the sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm computes an optimal order to visit the sensor nodes by the MDT to collect their data with minimal travel distance. The proposed algorithm is compared with tree-based data collection approaches and ant colony optimization approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform other approaches minimizing the tour length under different scenarios. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Backbone nodes; Data gathering; Discrete firefly algorithm; Tour length; Wireless sensor networks","Ant colony optimization; Bioluminescence; Data acquisition; Energy utilization; Optimization; Pollution control; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Backbone nodes; Data gathering; Discrete optimization problems; Firefly algorithms; Landslide detection; Mobile data gatherings; Precision Agriculture; Tour length; Sensor nodes","Yogarajan, G.; Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering CollegeIndia; email: yogarajang@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018311053

Numeral of sensor inside WSN is proportionate to the WSN accuracy. As WSN may be operated in unsupervised and aggressive environment because of this probability of failure of sensor node inside WSN is increased. If any of the sensor node is failed, this will lead to the change the WSN topology, also create network separation, increases the distance between a node pair and reduce secondary available shortest routes.

Sensor nodes transmit their data towards the static sink in a multi-hop manner. Sensor near the static sink contains all data of other sensors and its own data and thus it drains their energy very fast. So balancing energy throughout the network is important. Efficient utilization of energy is the main objective in WSN for maximization of a network's lifetime. For reducing the energy-hole problem in WSN a mobile sink approach is used. Mobility in WSN contains movement of the node around the network which consumes energy efficiently. However frequently changing the sink topology, determines the energy consumption. Moving the sink node is an effective solution for improving the lifetime of WSN. There are different methods in the literature schedule sink movements and determine sink stay points. Here the mobility of sink node can be considered based on distance of the Cluster Head (CH). Here mobile sink node checks the distance from the all CHs and moves the mobile sink to less distance CH. It also finds out the intersection points of two CHs. Depending on the intersection points mobile sink will move in between and collect data from the both CHs. Hence using this approach mobility will reduce and efficiently consumes more energy in network. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes and Mobility; Wireless sensor network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Balancing energy; Critical problems; Effective solution; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy-hole problems; Intersection points; Network lifetime; Sink mobility; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509013388,,,"English","Int.

In envisaged applications of WSN such as detection of forest fire, military surveillance est. battery replacement of sensor nodes are not feasible due to their deployment in hazardous areas and consequently all data routing protocols should be energy efficient. Hierarchical Routing Protocol (HRP) in WSN rotates different responsibilities among nodes with an aim to preserve energy. In this paper we propose a new HRP coined as FCM-ACO for WSN. The deployed nodes are partitioned into fixed clusters by the base station (BS) using Fuzzy C Means (FCM). The cluster heads (CH's) are locally selected from clusters based on residual energy and proximity to BS. Data flows from non cluster head nodes (non-CH) to their respective CH and is aggregated by the latter. An upper chain consisting of the CH's is constructed by BS using ant colony optimization (ACO) along with the selection of a super leader (SL). Data flows along the upper chain being fused at every node except the terminal ones to the SL which transmits directly to BS.

Routing a packet from a sender to a receiver in an adhoc wireless sensor network, in which the nodes are open to move arbitrarily and organize themselves. Here we discovered a correct path for transmission of data according to route discovery problem. The main thing of the challenge is that in these types of networks there are no base stations so that the nodes themselves performs also functions such as switches and forwarding information to their receiver while coping with the dynamically changing network topology. A route between the sender and the receiver is available as soon as possible because each node contains routing tables which provide the information about the next node on the route. Routing table's management requires that every node to exchange routing tables with its neighborhood whenever a topology changed is identified then re-generates the routes based on the updated information. Different Protocols are define in which a route-discovery phase follow the transmission of a data.

In this approach cellular phone user is considered as primary user (PU) with the permission to utilize the license band and CRSN may be designed in underlay mode to operate in the emergency situation simultaneously with the PU to send sensory information about the presence of explosives to the nearest base station. In this application CRSN would act as secondary user (SU) and share power of its own PU to send the emergency information that in turn causes interference and minimizes the PU's quality of service (QoS). The challenging issue is to share the allocated power of the PU with SU sustaining the link connection of the PU with the base station. We have used Nash Bargaining Power Control (NBPC) technique to search optimal powers at different distances from the base station for both the PU and SU of the proposed integrated cellular phone system and ultimately control the power of both PU and SU in the emergency environment. A comparative analysis of NBPC has been done with the traditional power control scheme called Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) Balancing Power Control (SBPC).

The lack of wires facilitates to overcome most limitations of traditional wired networks, allowing deployment in hostile environment or mobile scenarios. When nodes do not depend on any pre-existing infrastructure, wireless network is known as wireless ad-hoc network. In this case, communication relies on the ability of the nodes to form a multi-hop radio network. Security is a major concern in every communication system. Every node in network must be authenticated for reliable communication. There are many authentication algorithms like message authentication codes, public key cryptography etc. Most of these mechanisms are either insecure or complex. In this paper we have proposed an algorithm for authentication of sensor nodes in wireless sensor nodes, the proposed algorithm uses key distribution for authentication of nodes. The sensor nodes are logically arranged in form of binary tree with base station forming root node. A key is calculated for each node by its parent based on ID of node and key of parent. Authentication of a node can be done only by its parent. Any authentication request of a node is sent to its parent node and it authenticates the node. The proposed mechanism is simulated in Matlab and its performance is evaluated. It has been found that the proposed mechanism is successfully authenticating the sensor nodes and is simple and secure as well. © 2016 IEEE.","Hashkey; ID; Kparent; Kchild","Ad hoc networks; Binary trees; Cryptography; Mobile telecommunication systems; Public key cryptography; Secure communication; Sensor nodes; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Authentication algorithm; Hashkey; Hostile environments; Message authentication codes; Multi-hop radio networks; Node authentications; Reliable communication; Wireless sensor node; Authentication",,"Sheikh R.Mishra D.K.Jain S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055159,,,"English","Proc.

However, for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, the SS nodes play a vital role. When the data sent by the associated SS nodes in an event area exceed the preconfigured threshold, the CS nodes start sensing the event and send the video data to the BS. Therefore, in addition to the lifetime of the CS nodes, the lifetime of the SS nodes and their data reporting latencies are important aspects for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, while sending both the video and scalar data to the BS. In this work, we propose a topology management-based distributed camera actuation scheme, named TADA, to prolong the lifetime of SS nodes, and decrease the data reporting latency in event area only. The increased lifetime of the SS nodes, in turn, increases the event coverage and packet delivery ratio. To increase the lifetime of the SS nodes in an event area, the SS nodes with the most residual energies are selected as the packet aggregators. In addition, the transmission range of these nodes is decreased, and in-network packet aggregation is performed, while reporting the happening of an event to the associated CS nodes. The aggregator selection mechanism helps in balancing energy consumption of the SS nodes. Similarly, the decrease in transmission range and aggregation mechanism help in decreasing energy consumption of these nodes. The transmission range of the SS nodes is decreased using social network analysis and Coalition Formation Game (CFG). CFG also helps in decreasing the data reporting latency of an event by the SS nodes to their associated CS nodes. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme, TADA, which is based on the distributed topology management protocol named T-Must, achieves high performance in terms of the lifetime of the SS nodes, data reporting latency, coverage ratio of the event, event reporting credibility index, and packet delivery ratio in an environment affected by shadow fading. © 2017 ACM.","C.2.2 [computer-communication networks]: network protocols-topology control, in-network packet aggregation, medium access control; Coalition formation game; Design; In-network packet aggregation; Performance; Radio interference; Social network analysis; Wireless multimedia sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks","Access control; Cameras; Computer games; Design; Energy utilization; Fading (radio); Medium access control; Network protocols; Radio interference; Social networking (online); Topology; Video recording; Wireless sensor networks; Coalition formation games; In networks; Performance; Topology control; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Sensor nodes",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15564665,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

In a cluster based routing approach, cluster heads (CHs) cooperate with each other to forward their data to the base station (BS) via multi-hop routing. In this process, CHs closer to the BS are burdened with heavier relay traffic and tend to die prematurely which causes network partition is popularly known as a hot spot problem. To mitigate the hot spot problem, in this paper, we propose unequal clustering and routing algorithms based on novel chemical reaction optimization (nCRO) paradigm, we jointly call these algorithms as novel CRO based unequal clustering and routing algorithms (nCRO-UCRA). In clustering, we partition the network into unequal clusters such that smaller size clusters near to the sink and larger size clusters relatively far away from the sink. For this purpose, we develop the CH selection algorithm based on nCRO paradigm and assign the non-cluster head sensor nodes to the CHs based on derived cost function. Then, a routing algorithm is presented which is also based on nCRO based approach. All these algorithms are developed with the efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and novel potential energy functions. The nCRO-UCRA is simulated extensively on various scenarios of WSNs and varying number of sensors and the CHs. The results are compared with some existing algorithms and original CRO based algorithm called as CRO-UCRA to show the superiority in terms of various performance metrics like residual energy, network lifetime, number of alive nodes, data packets received by the BS and convergence rate. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Chemical reaction optimization; Clustering; Hot spot problem; Routing; Wireless sensor network","Algorithms; Chemical reactions; Cost functions; Network routing; Optimization; Potential energy; Potential energy functions; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Chemical-reaction optimizations; Cluster-based routing; Clustering; Hot spot problem; Performance metrics; Routing; Selection algorithm; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Clustering algorithms","Srinivasa Rao, P.C.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: pasupuleti.vasu@yahoo.in",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954318315

These include Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems and Distributed Control Systems (DCS). ICS typically perform the ""Command and Control"" operations required for smooth functioning of machines in industrial production. They are widely used in Critical infrastructures such as power generation and distribution systems, Oil and Gas plants, Chemical factories and various other manufacturing facilities. Traditionally, ICS used proprietary protocols and operated in isolation. Perimeter security was considered enough as the only means to compromise these systems was via physical access to the systems. However, increased standardization, open architecture adoption and connectivity to enterprise networks as well as internet opened up these systems for a wide range of audience and enabled remote attacks. In this new operation landscape, it is imperative that newer means of securing the networks are adopted continuously. One of the security considerations for the ICS networks is the communication paths used by these networks. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (n.d.) plays a key role in securing the communication of ICS networks. Using Digital Certificates, PKI provides a mechanism to verify the identity of all the entities on a network and also ensures that the information is shared securely between communicating entities. PKI is a proven mechanism for secure communication and is widely used in many organizations. However, PKI as a solution to ICS security is challenging due to factors such as resource constrained environments, bandwidth considerations and hard real-time communication requirements. This paper intends to focus on key challenges in Digital Certificate management and correct deployment of PKI in ICS networks and will also present recommendations to overcome these challenges without compromising the basic functionalities of ICS. © 2017, IGI Global.","CA; Certificate; Challenges; Digital; ICS; PKI; Recommendations; SCADA; Security; Signature","Calcium; Closed loop control systems; Control systems; Data acquisition; Distributed computer systems; Distributed parameter control systems; Gas plants; Integrated circuits; Intelligent control; Plants (botany); Public key cryptography; SCADA systems; Certificate; Challenges; Digital; Recommendations; SCADA; Security; Signature; Network security",,,"IGI Global",19301650,,,,"English","Int.

An average case probabilistic analysis is done based on perfect matching of random bipartite graphs to establish a theoretical lower bound on the number of nodes to be deployed.

The reliable delivery is only possible when the routing protocols are efficient and secure. Because of lack of resources it is not possible to use existing cryptosystems to provide security in WSN. But, trust aware routing can provide the security with lesser resources, which become popular in last three to four years. In this paper, a new energy efficient and trust aware reliable opportunistic routing (TAEROR) protocol is proposed. The protocol consists of a trust metric and also a relay selection algorithm. The trust aware metric detects the malicious nodes on the basis of forwarding sincerity, energy consumption and acknowledgement sincerity. Relay selection algorithms avoid these malicious nodes to get selected in the routing process. The protocol is simulated and compared to existing trust aware routing protocols.

Sensor nodes sense the environment periodically and forward the collected data to a sink. In a single sink WSNs, nodes closer to the sink become overburdened for relaying excessive data. This may incur faster energy consumption by nodes and lead an energy hole around the sink. As a result, the network lifetime is shortened. Multiple sinks mitigate this problem, reduce energy consumption at nodes and prolong the network lifetime by distributing the traffic over multiple sinks. This paper focuses on multiple sink placement problem and proposes two local search technique based energy aware multiple sink placement strategies for WSNs. The lifetime oriented approach based sink placement takes into account the lifetime of nodes and places the sinks at suitable locations such that the average network lifetime is increased. While the energy oriented approach focuses on minimizing the average energy consumption of the network. We evaluate the performance of both the strategies via simulations and compare them with random sink placement strategy. Simulation results highlight that the lifetime oriented approach improves the lifetime significantly. © 2017 IEEE.","average energy consumption; average network lifetime; communication tree; grouping; multiple sinks; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Average energy; grouping; Local search techniques; Multiple sinks; Network lifetime; Placement problems; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032600,,,"English","Proc.

The paper introduces an algorithm for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks. It aims to conserve the battery power of sensors to be utilized for synchronization among the nodes in the network. The proposed synchronization approach is topology driven. In the existing literature, a wide range of protocols use flooding as the basic mechanism to create a topology. However, our method is based on the clustering of nodes with minimum hop distance from the cluster head and the chaining of cluster heads in order to create an energy-efficient topology. Also, it results in substantial reduction in the total transmission overhead. Further, it restricts the energy consumption in synchronizing the nodes of the network. Moreover, the approach avoids the loss of network coverage by electing a new cluster head in the event of cluster head failure. Finally, the simulation results exhibits that the proposed approach has significant energy savings as compared to many popular algorithms. © 2017 ACM.","Chaining; Clustering; Energy-efficiency; Synchronization","Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Synchronization; Topology; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Chaining; Clustering; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy efficient topologies; Network coverage; Substantial reduction; Time synchronization; Total transmission; Energy efficiency",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348683,,,"English","ACM Int.

It is the need of hour to monitor air quality in order to reduce air pollution. Exposure to air pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which is estimated to be the cause for 620,000 early deaths in 2010, and the impact on health due to air pollution in India has been calculated at 3 percent of its GDP. In recent years, air pollution has acquired critical dimensions and the air quality in most cities that monitor outdoor air pollution fail to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels. Air pollution is a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings which need to be controlled. With the advancements in technology, several innovations have been made in the field of communications that are transitioning to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this domain, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are one of those independent sensing devices to monitor physical and environmental conditions along with thousands of applications in other fields. In this paper, we are proposing the deployment of WSN sensor nodes in public transport buses for the constant monitoring of air pollution. The data regarding the air pollution particles such as emissions, smoke, and other pollutants will be collected via sensors on the public transport bus and the data will be aggregated and transmitted to the nearest sink node. Using the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) the collected data will be uploaded on the cloud server also called as the IoT cloud where a large amount of the data is stored.

LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Protocol) is one of the hierarchical protocol in WSNs. LEACH uses TDMA MAC Protocol. During random data distribution, a number of TDMA slots are wasted. Because sensor nodes don't know either they have data to send or not, they continuously listen to the medium and this result in idle listening problem.

Sensor nodes in WSNare connected to each other by networks, mainly powered by a battery source. These sensor nodes have lesser amount of power and computational capabilities. Typically, sensor nodes are deployed in remote areas where replacement of their batteries once exhausted becomes extremely difficult and cumbersome. Battery power is crucial aspect of the network (while designing a protocol). To maximize the lifespan of sensor nodes we recommend a genetic algorithm-based model. In this model, energy is distributed among all the sensor nodes and network performance is enriched by choosing the cluster head and clustering on the basis of 3 important factors: a. residual energy, b. distance from the sink and c. trust of the node. The trust of the node helps to detect malicious (abnormal) nodes in the neighborhood. To further maximize the network lifetime, the proposed model implements a multihop routing mechanism for data dissemination from source to the sink. To prove the real-time effectiveness of the proposed model, we simulated it using Matlab and compared with 'Design and Implementation of a New Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm using Genetic Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks (DINEECAGA)'[11].

These sensor nodes needs the power or energy to operate which is generally provided by battery. since these batteries have limited amount of energy so energy consumption in sensor network is a serious issue. It is desirable to design a protocol in WSN which reduces the energy consumption so to enhance the network lifetime. In this work, an energy efficient protocol is designed using Discrete Binary Particle Swarm Optimization which enhances the network lifetime without degrading network performance. In this work weighted sum approach is use to convert multiobjective optimization problem into a single objective optimization problem. Three parameters residual energy of sensor nodes, load mismatch in clusters and distance from CH to BS is taken into account in order to meet the objective. Simulation results shows that the proposed work improve the network lifetime significantly as compare to LEACH protocol. It is also observed that the proposed protocol outperforms the LEACH protocol in terms number of packets delivered to BS. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet protocols; Leaching; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; Clustering scheme; Energy efficient protocols; Multi-objective optimization problem; Physical quantities; Single objective optimization problems; Three parameters; Weighted sum approaches; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,"Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032570,,,"English","Proc.

Related work illustrates number of researchers are proposed different aggregation methods such as synopsis diffusion, predicate count and sum technique. Issue is that these aggregation techniques don't have capability to recognize fake sub aggregate of compromise nodes. Problem is that this can causes huge errors at base station. Logical OR operation is performed by this system for aggregation of the digest at mediatory node. This system causes more risk at the time of information modification. To solve this problem, our system implements appending method to decrease the risk in data aggregation.

The Cluster Head (CH) usually performs data fusion, aggregation and communication of the aggregated data to the Base Station. As the CHs communicate with the Base Stations located at larger distances than the member nodes, they generally consume more energy. This leads to energy drainage of CHs at a faster rate than the member nodes. This is overcome by re-electing new CHs at periodic intervals to balance the energy consumption among all the nodes in the network. Many CH reselection techniques based on various factors are proposed in the literature. Yet, experimentally these proposals are not validated. Hence, to validate the basis of CH selection, experiments using ZigBee motes is conducted in real time. Experiments are carried out by choosing nodes at different positions from the base Station as CH. The Inter and Intra energy consumption is calculated and presented. The experimental studies reveal that the centroid or close to centroid is the optimal position of the CH. Thus the optimal location of CH helps in minimizing the energy consumption which in turn increases the lifetime of the network. © 2016 IEEE.","cluster head selection; clustering; Energy consumption; network lifetime; Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations; Data fusion; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Zigbee; Aggregated datum; Cluster-head selections; clustering; Faster rates; Network energy consumption; Network lifetime; Optimal locations; Optimal position; Wireless sensor networks",,"Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032570,,,"English","Proc.

This data can be of any type but it must consists the identity of that particular node where this data actually exist. The identity of that particular node is also as much important as the data. Due to this, there can be some security issues because if the identity of that particular node leaked out then any fake node can act as the original one and data will start transferring between that fake node and cluster heads (CH). Many attacks like Man-in-The-middle and DoS (Denial of Service) lead to the whole network in sink.

In this paper, we present a coverage and connectivity aware data gathering protocol to provide sufficient coverage and connectivity in the network. The proposed protocol reduces the energy consumption of a network using a sleep scheduling scheme to periodically turn on and off the communication radios. A backbone of relay nodes and independent nodes is maintained for ensuring the connectivity in the network and this is also periodically rebuild the backbone setup. Each node transmits its sensory data to its closest independent node and an independent node forwards the sensed data via relay nodes toward the sink. The proposed protocol does not use any geographic information and is a fully distributed.

The primary task of WSN is to gather field data and route it to the BS for analysis. They are generally deployed in harsh localities where battery replacement is not possible advocating the need for energy efficient data gathering to elongate network lifetime. In cluster based hierarchical routing protocols (HRP's) the energy intensive task of being a cluster head are performed by a subset of deployed nodes while others are engaged in local communication. The roles of the nodes are interchanged in different rounds for load balancing. In this paper we propose an energy efficient load balanced data gathering protocol coined as RF-LEACH where partitioning is done using rough fuzzy c means (RFCM) and cluster head selection is based on fuzzy logic. Matlab simulation results indicate RF-LEACH performs better than LEACH, Fuzzy LEACH and FCM LEACH in terms of extending network lifetime and throughput in a load balanced way.

The affected nodes behave normally after the resumption of favorable environmental conditions. Therefore, both dumb and transfaulty behaviors of sensor nodes are dynamic in nature. The nodes in these networks get temporarily isolated from the network, when they behave as dumb or transfaulty. Because of the presence of nodes with such behavior, dynamic communication holes may occur in the network, which are formed or removed and thus increase or decrease in size with time. Connectivity re-establishment procedures can mitigate holes by re-connecting isolated nodes with the network after activating the intermediate sleep nodes, adjusting the communication range of intermediate nodes, or by using an alternative communication mode. However, such procedures cannot always re-establish connectivity because of the lack of neighbor nodes in reduced or adjusted communication range. Therefore, routing schemes using greedy forwarding approaches need to bypass holes to avoid the data packets from getting stuck at the boundary nodes and efficiently delivering them to the sink. However, the existing hole avoidance schemes consider holes as static. The proposed scheme, BRIDGE, detects hole boundary and bypasses routing traffics in the dynamic hole scenario. In the proposed scheme, a boundary node selects the next hop based on the minimum distance from all the neighbor nodes to the destination node, although this minimum distance is more than the distance to the destination from the node itself.

Coverage and clustering techniques enable the sensor network to operate in group-based and region-based communication and thus save the node energy. Energy-efficient protocols save the node energy and increase the network life cycle in a resource-constrained sensor network. Cluster head (CH) node manages and controls the operations such as network topology, coverage area, and routing paths (multi-paths and fault-tolerant paths) of the network. In this paper, we present deterministic K-means secure coverage clustering (K-SCC) with periodic authentication. The proposed protocol uses coverage clustering technique with periodic authentication between the CH node and sensor nodes to establish the secure channel in the network. Maximum cover of K nodes is maintained in the secure coverage cluster to achieve authenticated communication between the sensor nodes in the network. The proposed K-SCC protocol is compared with the existing protocols such as deterministic-SCC and random-SCC protocols. Simulation results indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol achieves an average of 84% coverage ratio (cluster/sensor node ratio) as compared with 62% coverage ratio in the existing SCC protocols. Simulations also indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol consumes 20% less energy as compared with the existing SCC protocol. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This problem can be overcome by predicting the data beforehand and using the predicted data when there is a delay in the arrival of the data or when the data goes missing.

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is one such technology that is improving the quality of health care. WBAN has personal patient data. Attackers can access this data from Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) or from the wireless channel between nodes and server; this requires efficient security protocol for providing data security. In case of emergency, the vital parameters should be easily accessed by the doctor's or the paramedic. Stringent authentication and security criteria's makes it difficult to access the data during emergency, which may prove to be disastrous for the patient.

The major novelty of the paper is the two proposed algorithms through which the number of platoons and platoon heads (PH) are decided upon for increasing the network lifetime. Algorithm-1 analyze the distribution of nodes and forms a set of possible minimum number of platoons (clusters) having equal number nodes, based on Hierarchical clustering technique. The algorithm-2 partitions the given network into platoons and selects the platoon head (PH) based on coverage range of wireless node. It uses SPSS statistical software tool for platoon decomposition and also to determine the platoon head (PH). The number of iterations required for selection of PH is found to be minimum, irrespective of the number of network nodes. The platoon is controlled by its platoon head (PH) and the data transfer happens locally between the platoon nodes and its head. The platoon head alone communicates with the road side unit (RSU) and avoids multiple data link between the individual nodes of platoon to RSU.

This information is sent to base station (BS), where, it is processed and analyzed by the underlying application. Functioning of WSN highly depend on the deployment strategy and the coordination among the sensor nodes. Preserving the energy is an important goal that must be considered when developing a routing protocol for WSNs. Radio communication in sensor nodes is highly expensive operation in terms of energy usage. Energy can be conserved in an efficient way with specifically customized routing techniques. Data aggregation methods when applied to sensor nodes, clusters are created where data generated from cluster members is aggregated. This kind of data collection strategy results into energy efficient communication. Integration of data aggregation and clustering approach is enabled through customized hierarchical routing strategies. Clustering technique is key to apply and exploit, the advantages in-network data processing offers. This paper compares various clustering protocols like LEACHC, K-means and its variants. The protocols are compared with respect to network lifetime, data delivery and energy consumption. These protocols only consider intra cluster distance of members while doing clustering, due to this non-uniform clusters are created. These kind of clusters do not deliver data periodically and uniformly from every corner of the field. A density control based approach is proposed which does balancing of cluster members assignment in a loose way. A loose density control (LDC) based approach is integrated with K-means clustering method. LDC based approach exhibits improved average data delivery per node, ensuring regular data availability from every corner of the deployment area as long as the nodes are alive. Not only it improves the amount of data delivered, it also improves the network lifetime considerably. This performance improvement is achieved with almost similar energy expenditure compared to other protocols. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Clustering protocol; Clustering techniques; Controlled clustering; Data collection strategies; Energy efficient communications; Hierarchical routings; In-network data processing; K-means clustering method; Wireless sensor networks","Raval, G.; CSE Department, Institute of Technology, Nirma UniversityIndia; email: gaurang.raval@nirmauni.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",09467076,,,,"English","Microsyst Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973167531

Existing cloud pricing models are limited in terms of the homogeneity in service-types, and hence, are not compliant for the heterogeneous service oriented architecture of Se-aaS. We propose a new pricing model comprising of two components, applicable for Se-aaS architecture: pricing attributed to Hardware (pH) and pricing attributed to Infrastructure (pI). pH addresses the problem of pricing the physical sensor nodes subject to variable demand and utility of the end-users. It maximizes the profit incurred by every sensor owner, while keeping in mind the end-users' utility. pI mainly focuses on the pricing incurred due to the virtualization of resources. It takes into account the cost for the usage of the infrastructural resources, inclusive of the cost for maintaining virtualization within sensor-cloud. pI maximizes the profit of the sensor-cloud service provider (SCSP) by considering the user satisfaction. Simulation results depict improved performance of pH in comparison to the traditional hardware pricing algorithms, viz. PPM and Sprite, in terms of the residual energy, proximity to the base station (BS), received signal strength (RSS), overhead, and cumulative energy consumption. The results also show the tendency of the sensor-owners to converge to the end-user utility, but not exceed it. We also analyze the performance of pI.

The proposed multi-constraint, multi-objective routing optimization approach under strict resource constraints guarantees reliability and fast data delivery along with efficient power management in spite of unreliable wireless links and limited power supply. In query driven applications, the request from the sink to the individual sensor node will be a broadcast message, whereas the individual sensor nodes replies back to sink as unicast messages. In the proposed work, the fuzzy approach and “A Star” algorithm are utilized for satisfying energy and bandwidth constraints to route the broadcast messages of the sink while querying all the sensor nodes in the network. Every node will be provided with a guidance list, which is used to decide the next best neighbor node with good route quality for forwarding the received multi-hop broadcast messages. The route quality of the every node is estimated with fuzzy rules based on the network parameters such as maximum remaining energy, minimum traffic load and better link quality to increase the network lifetime. The provision of overhearing the broadcast messages and acknowledgements within the transmission range minimizes the effort to search for the active time of nodes while routing the broadcast messages with asynchronous scheduling. Further, in the proposed work only the time slot of its nearest neighbor relay node (to which packets are to be forwarded) is learnt to reduce the number of message transmissions in the network. For the unicast message replies, the fuzzy membership function is modified and devised based on the routing metrics such as higher residual energy, minimum traffic loads and minimum hop count under energy and bandwidth constraints. Also, the multi-hop heuristic routing algorithm called Nearest Neighbor Tree is effectively used to reduce the number of neighbors in the guidance list that are elected for forwarding. This helps to increase the individual sensor node's lifetime, thereby maximizes the network lifetime and guarantees increased network throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed technique reduces repeated transmissions, decreases the number of transmissions, shortens the active time of the sensor nodes and increases the network lifetime for query driven sensor network applications invariant to total the number of sensor nodes and sinks in the network. The proposed algorithm is tested in a small test bed of sensor network with ten nodes that monitors the room temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bandwidth efficient; Distributed algorithm; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetime; Multi-hop routing; Wireless sensor network","Bandwidth; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy inference; Information management; Membership functions; Network routing; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Power management; Sensor nodes; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Bandwidth efficient; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetimes; Multi-hop routing; Power management (telecommunication)","Kavi Priya, S.; Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College (Autonomous)India; email: urskavi@mepcoeng.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

In this manuscript, linear phase multiband stop filters (LPMBSFs) are designed using a robust hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called improved cuckoo search particle swarm optimization (ICSPSO) for searching desired impulse responses of the filters. Generally LPMBSFs are considered for simultaneous processing of group of spectra widely used in digital communication and signal processing applications. The window method and the simple frequency sampling method of designing linear phase multiband filters (LPMBFs) have no precise control over the stop band and pass band cut-off frequencies. Thus in order to improve the design strategy of the LPMBSF, optimum design criterion is devised where the error between ideal frequency response and practical frequency response is reduced by incorporating the efficient modern swarm and global evolutionary computation technique. The ICSPSO technique is such an excellent hybrid global random search technique for error minimization, and is structured incorporating the advantages of cuckoo search algorithm into particle swarm optimization (PSO) while the global searching capability is further accelerated by tuning the mutation operation of differential evolution (DE) technique.

There is no control in conventional EAS on energy absorption during operation of an aircraft emergency arrestment. Also, if there is any problem with conventional EAS during operation, complete system fails. For different types of aircrafts different EAS needed. To overcome these problems, we suggest to use the combination of existing conventional EAS and eddy current absorbing (ECA) system.

Such failures can result in a disconnection in part of the network and the sensed data being unable to obtain a route to the sink(s), i.e. a network failure. Network failures potentially degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It is very difficult to monitor network failures using a manual operator in a harsh or hostile environment. In such environments, communication links can easy fail because of node unequal energy depletion and hardware failure or invasion. Thus it is desirable that deployed sensor nodes are capable of overcoming network failures. In this paper, we consider the problem of tolerating network failures seen by deployed sensor nodes in a WSN. We first propose a novel clustering algorithm for WSNs, termed Distributed Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Clustering (DEEHC) that selects cluster heads according to the residual energy of deployed sensor nodes with the aid of a secondary timer. During the clustering phase, each sensor node finds k-vertex disjoint paths to cluster heads depending on the energy level of its neighbor sensor nodes. We then present a k-Vertex Disjoint Path Routing (kVDPR) algorithm where each cluster head finds k-vertex disjoint paths to the base station and relays their aggregate data to the base station. Furthermore, we also propose a novel Route Maintenance Mechanism (RMM) that can repair k-vertex disjoint paths throughout the monitoring session. The resulting WSNs become tolerant to k-1 failures in the worst case. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested using various network scenarios and compared to the existing state of the art approaches to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2016","Fault and link failures; Network failure; Wireless sensor network","Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Electric fault currents; Energy efficiency; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Repair; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication links; Distributed routing algorithm; Environmental hazards; Hostile environments; Link failures; Network failure; State-of-the-art approach; Vertex disjoint paths; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Chanak, P.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: prasenjit.chanak@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008406292

The doctor can get the patient’s physiological data collected by special sensors deployed on or in the patient’s body in real time with the mobile devices via the wireless communication channel. The collected data are important and should be confidential. So security measures are considered in the process of communication. Recently, He et al. (Multimed Syst, 21(1), 49–60, 2015) proposed a new two-factor authentication scheme for health-care with WMSNs and claimed it to be secure. But we find that it is vulnerable to the off-line guessing attack, the user impersonation attack, and the sensor node capture attack. Moreover, we present an improved scheme to overcome the disadvantages. Through the formal verification with Proverif and the analysis presented by us, our scheme is secure.

This dynamic reactive power requirement is proposed to be met by a DSTATCOM and thereby achieve voltage regulation, load balancing and harmonic elimination. Further these small generators can provide full benefit to rural customers if they are connected on a grid. An autonomous rural grid with induction generators in parallel is proposed for reliable supply of power and to harness the benefits of the grid.

The first one is an effective method to ensure the robust stability of the closed loop system whereas the second one is very useful in shaping the transient response of the closed loop system by placing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the desired locations. Hence, to design a controller which not only ensures the robust stability of the closed loop system but also shapes the closed loop transient response very well, these two methods are combined by minimizing a mixed time and frequency domain performance index. A directed search based method already exists in the literature to solve such an optimization problem. But such a directed search based method is computationally tedious as it requires gradient calculation of the objective function and does not guarantee to yield the global minimum of the objective function. The present work proposes a randomized algorithm based solution to the aforementioned optimization problem. This randomized algorithm based method is computationally easier than the directed search based method and gives improved results due to the increased chance of reaching the global minimum of the objective function. © 2016 IEEE.","Eigenstructure assignment; H∞ control; Randomized algorithm","Closed loop systems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Frequency domain analysis; Global optimization; Intelligent control; Optimization; Power control; Robustness (control systems); System stability; Transient analysis; Eigenstructure assignment; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Gradient calculations; Optimization problems; Optimization techniques; Randomized Algorithms; Robust controller design; Time and frequency domains; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

It is well known that stress cone is used in cable joints and terminations to relief electric stresses at the junction point of insulation and conductor screen. The high electric stress near the screen-cut zone may lead to tracking, partial discharge etc. which eventually jeopardize the operation of a power cable affecting its long-term performance. Moreover, a power cable during its period of operation is subjected to different transient electric stresses in the form of standard and non-standard lightning impulse voltages. Therefore, in this contribution, a comprehensive study of transient electric stresses of a medium voltage cable termination is performed by applying different standard and non standard lightning impulse voltages. For this purpose, a 11kV cable termination is modeled in Comsol Multiphysics Software. The transient electric field analysis is performed using Finite Element method. The stress cone deflector angle and the relative permittivity of the deflector material is also varied to obtain a best possible design that minimizes the electric stress at the insulation-screen junction of a cable termination under the application of impulse voltage stresses. © 2016 IEEE.","Cable termination; Electric field analysis; Finite element method; Lightning impulse","Cables; Electric connectors; Electric discharges; Electric fields; Electric insulation; Finite element method; Intelligent control; Lightning; Partial discharges; Power control; Stress analysis; Stress relief; Telecommunication cables; Electric field analysis; Lightning impulse; Long term performance; Medium voltage cables; Relative permittivity; Standard lightning impulse voltage; Transient electric fields; Transient electric stress; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

The light sources considered here are mainly concerned with the LEDs having variation in their CCTs. The road lighting actually consumes a significant amount of total energy requirement of a country all through the year. But from the point of view of security of road users road lighting is extremely important. With the passage of time role of road lighting has also gradually evolved from providing safety to drivers to providing visual comfort to the road users. Now road lighting also plays a major role in increasing the pedestrian feeling of safety and creating a better ambience. Thus visually acceptable and energy efficient road lighting is desirable. The mesopic luminance region lies between photopic and scotopic. The mesopic region covers luminance between about 0.001cd/m2 to 3cd/m2. It is neither luminosity function nor luminosity function alone are representative of the eye's spectral sensitivity in the mesopic region. Still today all dimensioning is based on the photopic luminosity function, which was established in 1924. Luminosity function describes the sensitivity of the retinal cone receptors and it is applicable to daytime vision. In the mesopic range both the rods and cones on the retina are active and this is believed to cause changes in the spectral sensitivity of the eye. LEDs are said to be the future light source because of their low energy usage and efficiency. The advantages of LEDs are that they are very robust, have a very long lifetime or up to 50,000 hours, they are easily dimmable and fail by dimming over time, rather than burn off like incandescent light bulbs. LEDs cause less glare irritation because of the smaller beam angle of the luminaire. The colour of the light depends on the composition and condition of the semiconducting material used. It can be infrared, visible or ultraviolet. Blue, green and red LEDs can be used to produce most perceptible colours, including white. Today, after many years of development, the LEDs on the market are now emitting white light in different colour temperatures as well as an advanced RGB control to produce coloured light to capture different moods for various aspects. Because of the huge potential of LED technology and the constant improvements in the quality (e.g. colour rendering), it can be predicted that the use of LEDs will become more common in both indoor and outdoor lighting with the advantage of energy savings due to their efficiency and long lifetime. Another advantage of using LED is it does not contain mercury (Hg), which is not an eco-friendly chemical and has adverse effect on human body. © 2016 IEEE.","Correlated Colour Temperature; Mesopic vision; Scotopic/Photopic or S/P ratio; Spectral Luminous Efficiency Function Curve; Spectral Power Density","Color; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Incandescent lamps; Intelligent control; Light sources; Lighting; Luminance; Mercury (metal); Pedestrian safety; Power control; Roads and streets; Spectroscopy; Transportation; Incandescent light bulbs; Luminosity functions; Mesopic vision; Scotopic/Photopic or S/P ratio; Semiconducting materials; Spectral luminous efficiency; Spectral power density; Total energy requirement; Light emitting diodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

If present, the sign will be highlighted, normalized in size and then classified. Neural network is used for classification purposes. For evaluation purpose, four type traffic signs such as Stop Sign, No Entry Sign, Give Way Sign, and Speed Limit Sign are used.

These converters generally use Power diodes or SCR (silicon controlled rectifiers) which has non-linear characteristics. Due to this reason such converters generate highly non-sinusoidal currents at the power supply utility. As a result of distorted currents the voltage waveforms at the point of common coupling (PCC) at which other consumers are connected are also exposed to distorted supply. This paper proposes a harmonic compensator using lesser number of power devices controlled by simple and effective current controlled PWM. The reference currents are generated offline based on a particular load current and is used to generate the PWM waveforms to drive the switches intended to reduce the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the input current in the three-phase ac supply system. The performance of the reduced switch harmonic compensator shows significant improvement in the nature of input currents. The power structure of the compensator is a three-limb voltage source converter consisting of four IGBTs, two per leg and the third leg comprising of two split capacitors forming the dc bus and its mid-point acting as the pole point for third wire connection of three-phase. © 2016 IEEE.","B-4 inverter; Current compensation; Harmonics; THD","Electric fault currents; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power converters; Thyristors; Current compensation; Current-controlled PWM; Harmonics; Nonlinear characteristics; Point of common coupling; Solid state converters; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Voltage source converters; Electric rectifiers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

In stark contrast to the model based paradigm which is targeted at addressing the fundamental physics driving the system and intends to freely determine the process transfer function. The data-driven approach instead connotes to ascertaining the process parameters of a system, void of a specified architecture by measuring the input and output data. The present investigation targets a validatory execution of a simple feedback DDC architecture on the position control of a DC motor module. The input-output data obtained from an onboard potentiometer is logged to the host PC using a low cost acquisition set-up and the corresponding model structure is identified using Matlab System Identification Toolbox. Based on the identified plant model, an appropriately tuned PID scheme is proposed that can represent the original hardware response with acceptable fidelity. The ability of the proposed control scheme is augmented by the introduction of standard repetitive control strategy in order to reduce Steady-State tracking errors of the system while negotiating periodic inputs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in offering a highly accurate asymptotic tracking ability. © 2016 IEEE.","Data Driven Control; DC Motor; Periodic Signals; Position Control; Repetitive Controller","Controllers; DC motors; Electric machine control; Intelligent control; Power control; Voltage dividers; Asymptotic tracking; Data-driven approach; Data-driven control; Fundamental physics; Model based controls; Periodic signal; Repetitive controller; Steady state tracking; Position control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

Due to the time delay of the control circuit, mostly controlling action has been initiated based on the past error that may hamper the precision of the controller. In this regards, future error has to be estimated to initiate the controlling action based on real-time error. But due to the presence of uncertainty in load and also the presence of mechanical inertia in the system, it is difficult to estimate the future speed error based on the Permanent Magnet Direct Current (PMDC) motor system equation. In this paper, the speed error estimation of PMDC motor has been incorporated based on backward arc length of error graph itself. The proposed error estimation approach applied to PMDC motor speed error tracking will overcome the effect of processing time delay of the controller. This proposed speed error tracking method pointing towards the time delay control of PMDC motor.

The application is considered in an agro-based project and therefore, Routing protocols are mandatory to send and receive packets. In this paper, we have evaluated the most commonly used routing protocols in MANET and compared the performance of reactive routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and proactive routing protocols such as Geographic Routing Protocol (GRP), and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol by using OPNET simulator 17.5. The OPNET simulator is optimal for core level network design and parameters of sensor nodes are detailed enough to design a sensor network as the MANET in this paper. Analysis of the performance of protocols are certainly depending on End to End delay (average), Network Load and the throughput. These parameters are the common primary issues behind routing and sensor nodes in the MANET will coordinate themselves following these issues staying in an environment of proactive or reactive routing.

To maintain the target tracking in timely fashion with accurate measurement of target movement is difficult as it summed up with many noises during the detection. Possibilities of node failure often come across in the tracking which results in loss of tracking. Thus to overcome difficulties of tracking new improved tracking framework called as Face (Polygons) Track is proposed. In Face Track sensors are deployed in polygonal fashion. Where polygon share common edge with non overlapping pattern these polygons are the faces and edges being reconstructed to generate each face further so as to avoid loss of tracking. In Face track with Kalman filter, KF optimally selects node as target moves ahead crossing the edges of the face. The Face track network is mapped to develop the courier management system.

The DNs can either be connected to a fusion center (referred to as centralized data processing; CDP) or process data independently and communicate with each other via a rate-limited link (referred to as distributed data processing; DDP). In the first stage of this two-stage cophasing scheme, sensors estimate the channel to the DNs using pilot symbols transmitted by the latter; following which they simultaneously transmit multiple streams of data symbols by prerotating them according to the estimated channel phases to the different DNs. The achievable rates for both CDP and DDP are derived to quantify the gains obtainable by the multistream DCP. In order to aid data detection at the receiver, we propose a least-squares-based iterative algorithm for blind channel estimation in CDP-DCP. Following this, we develop a message passing based blind channel estimation algorithm for DDP-DCP. It is found using Monte Carlo simulations that for the CDP system, the proposed blind channel estimation algorithm achieves a probability of error performance very close to that with perfect CSI at the DNs, while using only a moderate number of unknown data symbols for channel estimation. We also derive approximate expressions for the error probability performance of the proposed system for both CDP and DDP and validate their accuracy using Monte Carlo simulations. © 2016 IEEE.","blind channel estimation; data fusion; Distributed co-phasing; Distributed data detection; message passing; MIMO","Blind equalization; Data fusion; Data handling; Intelligent systems; Internet protocols; Iterative methods; Message passing; MIMO systems; Monte Carlo methods; Network layers; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Approximate expressions; Blind channel estimation; Co-phasing; Distributed data; Distributed data processing; Error probability performance; Multiple destinations; Probability of errors; Channel estimation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1053587X,,ITPRE,,"English","IEEE Trans Signal Process",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012932506

Due to their energy constraint issues, many routing algorithms have been developed for efficient forwarding of data for minimizing energy consumption. Considering the static sink, nodes near the sink will have more load for routing data, therefore sink has been made as mobile. Now the sink can itself moves to the sensor node or leader node for collecting data as sink can be charged with high energy. Moreover sensor nodes deployed in battlefields, hills and similar risky areas are difficult to monitor for their energy issues. So the concept of grid arises. Now the sensor network can be constructed as logical grids of uniform size and data aggregation can be done using energy efficient routing. The proposed algorithm is an enhanced form of VGDRA algorithm which is grid based routing algorithm but lacks the concept of estimating energy on the basis of distance. In the proposed algorithm, sensor network is divided into logical grids of k-cells and a Cell Header (CH) is elected among each cell that acts as leader to cluster. The algorithm proves to be efficient in terms of energy by minimizing route construction cost considering shortest distance to sink. © 2017 IEEE.","routing etc; virtual grid; Wireless sensor network","Clustering algorithms; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Low power electronics; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Construction costs; Data aggregation; Energy constraint; Energy efficient routing; Grid-based routing; Minimizing energy; routing etc; Virtual grids; Energy efficiency",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027170,,,"English","Proc.

This paper presents significantly improved results of an existing 6 switches and 4 DC sources multilevel inverter topology to produce great perfection in the seven level output voltage waveform. The major impact of the improved results is the reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD). The control methodology employed is Level Shifted PWM technique, based on which the topology is simulated for Phase Opposition Disposition, Alternate Phase Opposition Disposition and Alternate Phase Opposition Disposition + Variable Frequency modulation techniques. Multilevel Inverters today present a viable solution for high dynamic performance and power quality seeking applications, ultimately focusing to achieve almost perfect sinusoidal output voltage with minimum harmonic content. Thus, in this paper an effort is made to reduce the THD in the output voltage waveform. An analysis is done and a comparison is also made between the existing results and the new results obtained.

The PLC based power factor improvement algorithm is developed and implemented on a 3 Phase laboratory prototype IM coupled to a DC generator and the effectiveness of the algorithm is tested under no-load and loaded condition. Based on the instantaneously measured value of power factor, the PLC switches the appropriate bank of capacitors into the circuit depending on the load condition to improve the pf.

This paper proposes three-level flying capacitor inverter based distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) for shunt applications. A new floating capacitors voltage balancing schemes using loss balancing technique has been suggested to balance capacitor voltages. Because of benefits like simplicity, transformation less implementation, and scope of desired power factor setting; a generalized instantaneous symmetrical component theory is incorporated to extract the reference compensator current. A basic three-level hysteresis controller is used to control the injected current by inverter so that it follows its reference value.

Therefore; the battery is discharged only under bad climate condition or at night when the PV array is insufficient to feed the water pump. Additionally; it is charged by the SPV array when the water delivery is not required. Thus; no external supply is used for the battery charging.

In this context, H∞ based integral sliding mode controller is designed for inverted pendulum for stabilizing the system. The H∞ state feedback gains are obtained by formulating the Riccati equation. These gains stabilize not only the closed loop transfer function, which maps the performance output to the disturbance input but also the system around its unstable equilibrium point. However this will not account for parameter variation and disturbance effect. Hence, a robust integral sliding surface is constructed such that during sliding motion the closed loop system will lead to disturbance rejection. Next, the switching control law is synthesized to maintain the states on the sliding surface from the initial time. The effectiveness of the controller design is verified by considering various uncertainties. © 2016 IEEE.","Cart Pendulum System; H∞ Control via State Feedback; Integral Sliding Surface; Riccati Equation; Sliding Mode Control","Closed loop systems; Disturbance rejection; Feedback; Intelligent control; Pendulums; Power control; Power electronics; Riccati equations; Sliding mode control; State feedback; Closed loop transfer function; Controller designs; Disturbance effects; Integral sliding mode; Pendulum system; Sliding surface; State feedback gain; Unstable equilibrium points; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This increment leads us to take into account their adverse effects on the power system as it causes the power system signals to carry different frequency components, which generate harmonics in the system. These harmonic components modifies the line admittance matrix, to some unacceptable limits, used for power flow calculations. Such modification results in error during fundamental load flow calculations. In this paper an efficient methodology to locate the harmonic sources and their injection levels has been proposed. Analysis requires the measurement data of phasor measurement units (PMUs) which are costly one. Hence, binary particle swarm optimization algorithm has been proposed for optimal placement of PMUs to get the harmonic data. The proposed harmonic identification approach is centered around the orientation of harmonic power flow at system buses. The proposed methodology is applied and validated for a 18 bus radial distribution system. © 2016 IEEE.","Harmonic analysis method; harmonic injection level; harmonic source identification; phasor measurement units (PMUs)","Electric load flow; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Phase measurement; Power control; Power electronics; Quantum well lasers; Units of measurement; Binary particle swarm optimization; Harmonic analysis method; Harmonic identification; Harmonic injection; Harmonic sources; Phasor measurement unit (PMUs); Power flow calculations; Radial distribution systems; Phasor measurement units",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The topology provides isolation to avoid common mode problems/ leakage currents together with low stresses on the switches making it robust and highly efficient.

DERs can be used to its maximum efficiency through MicroGrid (MG). This also led to a path for Smart MicroGrid (SMG) where DERs are scheduled and dispatched economically as well as eco-friendly. Due to intermittent nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in MG and dynamic nature of demand static dispatch of modern power system is not of any use. Thus, it is very important to research economical scheduling and associated dispatch of power system connected with MG. This considers random variations of DERs referred as dynamic dispatch. This paper presents the economic as well as environmental dispatch scheduling of a power system connected to MG composed of different distributed energy resources and storage devices. The overall generation cost of static and dynamic dispatch of proposed system has also been compared. A mathematical model of given system has been formulated considering all the system constraints and ramp rate constraint of generators to minimize the operational and pollutant treatment cost. The optimization study has been carried out in two different modes: (i) Grid connected with MG; and (ii) Isolated grid operation. Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming technique has been used to solve the Unit Commitment (UC) and dispatch problem. The influence of scheduling strategies on operational cost and pollutant treatment cost has been obtained and compared and the impact of MG interconnection with the power system has been shown in terms of operational cost, pollutant treatment cost, total cost and on the unit commitment of power system to reduce the burden on grid generators. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed Energy Resources; Dynamic Dispatch; Microgrid; Optimization; Scheduling","Costs; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Integer programming; Intelligent control; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Pollution; Power control; Power electronics; Ramp generators; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Virtual storage; Distributed Energy Resources; Dynamic dispatch; Environmental dispatch; Independent power producers; Micro grid; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Renewable energy source; Technological development; Electric load dispatching",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Therefore accuracy and performance of BLDC motor drivers should be enhanced through sensorless technology. Many sensorless methods are existing in literature to sense the rotor position of motor, but this paper explain and proposed zero crossing back-EMF detection method. This paper work on analysis of sensorless techniques to sense the rotor position and PWM based speed control of inverter-fed sensorless BLDC motor. Modeling and simulation of three-phase star connected sensorless BLDC motor is done in MATLAB/Simulink environment. An accurate speed estimation has been achieved by using back EMF zero crossing speed estimation method. Fast response with negligible settling time has been obtained by this method of sensorless speed estimation of BLDC motor. © 2016 IEEE.","Brushless DC (BLDC) Motor; Electro Motive Force (EMF); Permanent Magnet (PM); Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM); Sensorless Position Control and Zero Crossing Point (ZCP)","AC motors; Electric drives; Electric machine control; Electric motors; Hall effect transducers; Intelligent control; Magnets; MATLAB; Permanent magnets; Position control; Power control; Power electronics; Sensorless control; Speed; Speed control; Synchronous motors; Brushless dc (BLDC) motors; Brushless dc motor drives; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Permanent magnets (pm); Position and speed control; Sensor less speed estimation; Zero crossing points; Brushless DC motors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

So, there are many disturbances that occur in the system like voltage sag and swell, fault, unbalance loading, uncontrolled power flow, etc. The SEN transformer (ST) is one of the devices to regulate the power flow in the system. In this paper, the ST has been used to mitigate voltage sag and swell in the transmission line with different phase angle of injecting voltage. The SEN transformer has the advantage of controlling active power flow and reactive power flow in the line independently like UPFC. In this paper, the ST is simulated in MATLAB/ SIMULINK for compensating voltage in transmission line during fault condition for maintaining constant voltage profile of the system.

Though the vector control of induction motor is fast and efficient for variable speed operation, it is not worth using in applications such as electric vehicles where changes in speeds are not as fast as in servo applications. The proposed controller uses an improved form of traditional scalar methodology with the addition of current loop. The motor torque is varied in terms of motor control voltage in closed current loop using dc current sensor. The improved scalar works in a closed loop for automatic adjustment of torque value and does not use any external speed sensor. A multi-slope voltage/frequency (V/Hz) ramp allows the induction motor to operate in the required torque-speed profile of the EV at its optimum efficiency values in all operating conditions. Initially, the effectiveness of the improved scalar control algorithm is evaluated by conducting appropriate simulations. The control algorithm is developed on TMS320F28335 digital signal processor from Texas Instruments.

Using wind power to produce electricity is a perfect fit. Because wind energy has become the least expensive source of new electric power that is also compatible with environment preservation programs many countries promote wind power technology by means of national programs and market incentives. Also it provides an effective solution for reduction of fossil fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. The wind turbines are used for the generation of wind energy, simple in construction, economical and which gives appreciable output. Wind shear is one of the major factors affecting the working of wind turbines. Vertical shear, or the change of winds with height, either enhances or diminishes the vertical draft strengths. Input parameters and output parameters vary with different turbines. Flicker voltage is one of the major parameter concerned with the wind turbine parameters. Voltage flicker are caused due to heavy loads periodically turned on and off in a weak distribution system.

As power and voltage rating increases; device constraint as well ashigh switching loss creates serious problems. Various pulse width modulated strategies like sinusoidal; 3rd harmonic injection and space vector PWM (SVPWM) employs high frequency switching to obtain quality output voltage with less ripple. Increasing number of voltage levels in a multi-level inverter requires an increase in number of active switches and passive elements. The problem of dead time requirement and shoot-through in PWM inverters distorts the output waveform and transfers less energy to load. A new type of three-phase VSI called three-phase Infinite Level Inverter (ILI) is proposed to mitigate all the above problems to a large extent. The device constraint and switching loss at high frequency is substantially reduced due to lower input DC supply. To get same output voltage; the proposed inverter requires only half of the DC link voltage compared to sine PWM inverter. Also; ILI takes only 0.576 times the input DC voltage compared to 3rd harmonic-injection or SVPWM. This shows that the proposed inverter has the maximum DC link utilization. The number of active switches and passive elements are same for any number of voltage levels. This topology is a multi-level inverter as there are many levels in the output voltage. Shoot-through problem is avoided and thus the proposed inverter doesn't need a dead time; leading to a better system reliability. Hysteresis current control is used for closed loop control. Results obtained from experimental setup and computer simulation using MATLAB/Simulink are presented to verify the above scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","High DC Link Utilization; Multi-level Inverter; Three-phase PWM Inverter","Electric current control; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Power control; Power electronics; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Closed-loop control; DC links; High-frequency switching; Hysteresis current control; Multilevel inverter; Pulse width modulated voltage source inverters; Pulse-width-modulated; PWM inverter; Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A solar cell being the smallest energy unit of any solar power system, an array of such solar cells constitutes a solar panel. The output of a solar panel follows a nonlinear current voltage characteristic which depends primarily on irradiance, temperature and load connected. A distinct point for fixed atmospheric conditions for which maximum power is extracted from the panel is the Maximum Power Point(MPP). A number of constraints are associated with installing, operating and thus studying the behaviour and designing a power system for solar panels. This paper thus discusses about the design of prototype indoor solar panel simulator along with the design of a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) System. Using this design efficiently, a large range of panels for various dynamic atmospheric conditions can be simulated. Various MPPT algorithms can be tested and analysed for their performance in actual solar power systems. The entire system consists of DC DC converter, a driver for the MOSFET, Voltage and Current Sensors, microcontroller, a DC programmable source and GUI on Visual Basic.

Transformer plays a vital role in the power system as it acts as the heart of power supply. Failure of transformer leads to malfunction of the whole power system. Unfortunately; the failure rate of the power transformer in India is 25% per annum as against less than 1% in the developed country. So monitoring the health of a transformer is essential. The health of a transformer depends on the condition of insulation winding. The power factor of the solid insulation winding is a critical parameter to adjudge its condition under real operating condition. Two in service generator transformers each of rating 4.9MVA were investigated to calculate its power factor with DOBLE M4100 insulation analyzer. Several other tests like DGA; HPLC and MOISTURE CONTENT were performed to finally conclude the condition of insulation winding. During the testing phase; several interesting results have been found which must be considered while determining the condition of the insulation winding. The results concluded that the high power factor was not only because of the degradation of paper but also due to the moisture content in the paper. © 2016 IEEE.","Furans; High-performance Liquid Chromatography; Insulation Deterioration; Moisture Equilibrium; Power Factor; Watt Loss","Electric generators; Electric power factor; Electric power systems; Failure analysis; High performance liquid chromatography; Insulation; Intelligent control; Liquid chromatography; Moisture; Moisture determination; Outages; Power electronics; Power transformers; Winding; Developed countries; Electrical equipment; Furans; Insulation deterioration; Moisture equilibrium; Oil immersed transformers; Power factors; Real operating conditions; Power control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

It works on the principle of Faraday's and Ampere's law. RC can be used to measure both high speed impulse and alternating currents. RC offers some very important properties like wide bandwidth, galvanic isolation, linearity, lightness and cheap. Presence of all these properties makes RC better than conventional current transducers. It also offers many other applications viz., energy management, protection systems, CT calibration, current sharing, resistance, welding process, measurement of partial discharges and earth resistance of transmission towers. It can measure currents ranging from mili-amperes (mA) to mega-amperes (MA) without any saturation. The construction and measurement conditions decide the application of RC. The eccentricity of coil is the main parameter considered for modelling of RC. The eccentricity effect becomes prominent when the conductor gets displaced away from the centre due to the deviation from circular shape. Change in conductor position affects the measurements done, so this analysis ensures the accuracy of RC. In this paper, eccentricity analysis of RC is done using ANSYS software tool. The observed deviation of mutual inductance during the analysis can be justified with the theoretical existing data. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Transformers; Distributed Parameters; Eccentricity; FE Analysis; Rogowski coil","Electric equipment protection; Electric instrument transformers; Electric power transmission; Electric resistance; Electric transformers; Inductance; Intelligent control; Partial discharges; Power electronics; Alternating current; Conventional currents; Distributed parameter; Eccentricity; Eccentricity effects; FE analysis; Measurement conditions; Rogowski Coil; Power control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

But in domino logic excess power dissipation is observed because of precharge propagation, which is solved by using pseudo dynamic buffer (PDB) model. Using PDB we can save almost 67% of power. While succeeding to stop precharge propagation in domino logic PDB allows logic 1 to logic 0 transitions, this may cause erroneous output while cascading. Here we proposed footed quasi resistance (FQR) model modified from PDB which is having advantages of PDB and can avoid logic 1 to logic 0 transitions at output. By using FQR we can get maximum of 57% power saving compared to domino logic, which is worthwhile to get faultless output in cascaded logic circuits.

Formation of islanding phenomenon is one of the major issued problem confronted with this kind of power generation scheme, in which DG source may keep working in a stable or normal way even if main electric power system (EPS) has failed. There are various methodologies have been evolved and advanced to avert this situation. They are classified as detection through passive method, active and communication systems based method. Islanding occurrences is the most issued problem in a recent time power system working along with the DG. A variety of problems occur when a solar Photovoltaic is working as distributed generated (DG) source. Islanding refers to a condition when a DG source continues to supply power to a load even though there is no power from the main source during the disconnection from the main grid at the occurrence of fault or some other severe phenomenon, refers to a situation or condition called islanding. When workers who may not perceive that the load is still powered after the disconnection from the EPS or main source so this condition can be dangerous to the grid workers. When this condition occur the DG source should gets immediately disconnected from the local load in minimum time delay. Islanding causes unfavorable effects which are low power quality, personnel potential danger, grid-protection interference and equipment damage. Islanding can causes very dangerous or abnormal situation for both people and apparatus, So islanding should be quickly determine by inverters and protective relays. Islanding finding out through passive method examines system specification without inducing any interruption and disturbance into the grid (EPS). In this proposed paper the detection is based on distortion of output voltage, it measures Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) or frequency jump, Rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) at the Point of Common Coupling and detection by voltage unbalanced factor to reduces the non detection zone (NDZ). © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed Generation; Islanding Detection; Micro-grids; Passive Method; PV Array","Delay control systems; Distributed power generation; Electric equipment protection; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Intelligent control; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power electronics; Solar power generation; Specifications; Time delay; Electric power systems (EPS); Islanding detection; Micro grid; Passive methods; Point of common coupling; PV arrays; Rate of change of frequencies; Rate of change of voltages; Electric power system control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

To mitigate this difficulty and power fluctuations at the load end, a possible solution could be the integration of battery energy storage with PV system. The Storage system can potentially improve security, quality, reliability and availability of electricity supply from Solar PV power system. The Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) [1] is promising energy storage for reliability, scalability and deep discharge capacity. This paper presents an optimized power management scheme for solar PV power driven DC pump with energy storage for rural irrigation. The integrated PV system will supply power to the required demand of the 2 HP DC pump and excess power will charge the battery via a suitable DC-DC boost Converter [2]. During PV Power generation deficiency, the battery will be in discharging mode to supply the required power to drive the pump depending on its State of Charge (SOC) [3] and thus smoothens the transient power during that period. The PV output power is enhanced by implementing Perturb and observe (P&O) MPPT algorithm [4-5] under a set of practical insolation data. A 6kWh, 39 cells VRB storage [6] system has been modeled in MATLAB/ Simulink environment and the charge-discharge algorithm is decided based on real time VRFB State of Charge (SOC) prediction and Solar PV generation.

For the rural areas it becomes more difficult to provide 24 hours continuous supply on daily basis. Along with this difficulty there is another problem of continuous day by day degradation of conventional energy resources. For rural electrification the use of hybrid energy resources is becoming more attractive solution. The hybrid system can be a combination of different nonconventional resources like PV; DG; Battery and converter etc. With these resources the system can maintain its reliability. This paper presents simulation and optimization of a hybrid based power generation system using PV array and Diesel generator. The simulation and optimization is done using 'Homer' software. The hybrid system is designed as to completely fulfill the demand of the consumer of Sotai village at latitude (28°17′16″) and longitude (77°21′35″) of district Faridabad in Haryana. In this village only about 12 hours electricity is provided from grid therefore electric supply is not reliable and the consumers demand cannot be completely fulfilled. The area chosen has a power demand of 11937.65 kWh/day and solar radiation is about 5.14 kWh/m2/day. The solar radiation simulation and optimization gives the optimum cost and size of the hybrid power system. In this system the fuel required for power generation is low because of the PV/DG Combination.

For the proposed iris recognition technique, self mutated hybrid wavelet transform of Cosine-Walsh, Cosine-Kekre and Cosine-Sine are used to generate transformed iris images. Considering all the coefficients for 100% of energy, feature vector of transformed iris image is generated, thus the size of feature vector becomes extremely large. For proposed Iris recognition technique, 99%, 98%, 97% and 96% of partial energies are considered, thus the number of coefficients considered to generate the feature vector are very less and the size of feature vector reduces severely. Accuracy using partial energies is high as compared to 100% of energy. The self mutated hybrid wavelet transform gives improvement in Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) and faster recognition.

Utilizing electricity efficiently and reducing its wastage as much as possible is an important criterion considering the depleting natural reserves of fossil fuel traditionally used for its generation. The ever increasing demand of electricity places its judicious and efficient use at a prime importance for its consumers. This paved the way for developing appliance based automation for energy conservation. In an educational institution like college or university that has comparatively large infrastructure, it is quite difficult to regulate appliances manually 24/7 throughout the year. In light of this, and to prevent the superfluous usage and consumption of electricity, this paper presents analysis, design and development of low cost, simple circuitry and low power consumption device to automatically regulate electrical appliances based on motion detection.

The waves produce humungous amounts of energy and therefore the study of different characteristics associated with waves becomes an important aspect. One such characteristic is the wave height. The height of a wave determines the impact that it would have when it hits the surface thereby playing a crucial role in deciding the quality and commercial viability of a beach and in determining the extent of transportation of sediments to proximate coastal areas. If the wave becomes very vigorous then it would pose a serious threat to the lives of the people inhabiting coastal areas. Therefore the analysis of different characteristics of waves becomes all the more important. In this paper, we have presented a statistical estimation of one such characteristic namely the wave height, which is also one of the most significant parameters used for estimating wave energy.

Both these parameters are abruptly affected by the switching transient and faults that occur in power system network. Switching transient is common phenomena caused by capacitor bank present in power system. Energizing the capacitor that is present in the power system network causes inrush current and transient over voltage in the network, that is not only affects the quality of the power flow in the system but also affect the life cycle of capacitor bank as well as the circuit breaker. This paper deals with detail working of newly proposed system providing immense combination of resistance and reactance in the economical single static reactor connected through three phase isolated transformers at the time of charging of capacitor, through which it suppresses the energizing transient of 3 phase capacitors. In bypass mode, all the element of newly proposed system which consists of diode and IGBT start conducting simultaneously the surge voltage of primary side of isolated transformer exploit as short circuited and the secondary side's surge voltage approximately zero. Due to presence of freewheeling diode in the system, no surges in voltage appear across circuit breaker, due to which the life span of circuit and equipment increases.

Distributed Generation (DG) is assuming widespread popularity owing to its potential to solve numerous issues like the power system de-regulation; meeting the rising power demand; improving voltage profile; reduction in power losses etc. The Optimum Location of DG and optimum DG Sizing are the two critical issues in the integration of DG with the electric grid because the improper placement and improper sizing of DG in power system can not only leads to the enhanced total power losses but can also damage the normal operation of power system. Optimal placement of DG units is a nonlinear optimization problem. This paper proposes a methodology to calculate the optimal location and effective optimal size. The influence of variation in location of DG with respect to the total power losses and voltage in the system is also carried out. The proposed methodology is tested on 33 bus radial distribution network. The obtained results are exhibited in graphical manner. The results achieved from the proposed methodology are paralleled with that of the exhaustive load flows. © 2016 IEEE.","DG Placement; Distributed Generation; Optimal Sizing; Sensitivity analysis","Distributed power generation; Electric losses; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Intelligent control; Location; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Power electronics; Sensitivity analysis; Dg placements; Generating capacity; Non-linear optimization problems; Optimal locations; Optimal placement and sizings; Optimal placements; Optimal sizing; Radial distribution networks; Power control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The wind power is generated using the permanent magnet brushless DC generator (PMBLDCG) and the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) is executed with P&O (Perturb & Observe) approach to extract the maximum power from the wind generation. This power is fed to the AC load using a voltage source inverter (VSI) through the battery bank (BSS) at DC link. The control algorithm operates in standalone mode and grid connected mode. It can switch in islanded and grid connected modes seamlessly according to the wind conditions. In standalone mode, this wind power is fed to the load through a VSI, during low wind conditions, the battery discharges itself to fulfill the load demand. After that, the grid is connected to give power to the load during low wind conditions, and for this, control algorithm operates in grid connected mode. Therefore, the control algorithm switches from voltage control to current control mode to provide smooth synchronization and vise versa at de-synchronization. A MATLAB/ Simulink model is developed to simulate the system performance during wind variations, and during synchronization and desynchronization. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Control; Grid; Microgrid; PMBLDCG; Standalone; Synchronization; Voltage Control; VSI","Electric batteries; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Permanent magnets; Power control; Power electronics; Synchronization; Voltage control; Wind power; Brushless DC generators; Grid; Matlab Simulink models; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Micro grid; PMBLDCG; Standalone; Voltage source inverter; Electric power system control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The segmentation of MR images of the neonatal brain is a fundamental step in the study and assessment of infant brain development. The highest level of development techniques for adult brain MRI segmentation are not suitable for neonatal brain, because of substantial contrasts in structure and tissue properties between newborn and fully developed brains. Current newborn brain MRI segmentation techniques either depend on manual interaction or require the utilization of atlases or templates, which unavoidably presents a bias of the results towards the population that was utilized to derive the atlases. In this paper, we proposed an atlas-free approach for the segmentation of neonatal brain MRI, based on the neural network approach.

Contingency analysis is one of the best methods to forecast the condition of power system if any unwanted event occured in the power system. To do contingency analysis first the operator has to know the parameters like voltage, power and voltage angle at each and every bus by doing load flow analysis on the system. Newton Raphson method is the best load flow method as it gives accurate results in less time. In this paper all line outage contingencies in a standard 6 bus and 5 bus power system has been done in MATLAB environment. For each line outage contingency, load flow analysis has been done on the system and the active power and voltage performance indices have been calculated. These two performance indices will give the idea about the change in active power flow through the lines and voltages at the buses for a particular line outage. Summation of these two indices will give the performance index value through which ranking of severity will be given to the lines. And from the load flow results comparison has been done between low rank and high rank line outage contingencies. This contingency analysis helps the operational engineer to know which line outage is dangerous to the system and what prior action is to be taken to minimize the effect of that particular line outage. © 2016 IEEE.","Contingency Selection; Line Outage; Newton Raphson Method; Overload; Performance Indices","Electric load flow; Electric power system protection; Intelligent control; Newton-Raphson method; Optimal systems; Power control; Power electronics; Transient analysis; Contingency analysis; Contingency Selection; Line outage; Line outage contingencies; Overload; Performance indices; Power system protection; Voltage performance indices; Outages",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The hybrid DSTATCOM is realized by a 3P3W DSTATCOM and AC power capacitor is used for compensating the nonzero-sequence currents harmonic in the 3P4W distribution system.

The values so obtained produces perfect harmonic cancellation (PHC) and unity power factor (UPF) for balanced and sinusoidal supply voltages based photovoltaic fed DSTATCOM (PV-DSTATCOM). However when supply voltages are distorted; PV-DSTATCOM may not produce PHC along with UPF due to non-linear behavior of the passive filter parameters. Hence; there should be an optimal calculation for filter parameters and PI controller gains; so that the PV-DSTATCOM can deliver optimal performance under distorted supply voltages. This paper presents a new algorithm based on teaching-learning behavior inside a classroom; to optimize the gains of PI controller and filter parameters.

Due to the environmental impact of SF6 gas, strict regulations have been laid to monitor their use and to restrict their emission from switchgears. Quartz based resonant density sensor is the best technology commercially available today for SF6 monitoring. Frequency response of the sensor is a function of both density and viscosity. However, each sensor contains a matched pair of quartz crystals for temperature compensation. The accuracy of the density sensor is limited by the extent of mismatch between the quartz crystals which determines the minimum detectable change in SF6 density. Calibration makes the sensor gas-specific and dependent on the environmental conditions. We propose a MEMS based resonator for in-situ SF6 viscosity measurement that can be used as an input to the existing gas density sensor.

But the conversion efficiency of a normal PV cell is low. One of the main reason for this is that the output of PV cell is dependent directly on the light intensity and with the position of the sun in the sky changing continuously from time to time; the absorption efficiency of an immobile solar panel would be significantly less at certain time of the day and year; for the solar photovoltaic cells are maximum productive when they are perpendicular to the sun and less productive otherwise. So to maximize the energy generation and improve the efficiency; solar trackers come into play. This paper presents the design and construction of an inexpensive active dual-axis solar tracking system for tracking the movement of the sun so as to get maximum power from the solar panels as they follow the sun. It uses Light Dependent Resistors to sense the position of the sun which is communicated to a Arduino Uno microcontroller which then commands a set of two servo-motors to re-orient the panel in order to stay perpendicular to the sun rays. The design was constructed successfully and tested using Lab View to determine the improvements in efficiency. Evaluation results show that the new system performs 13.44% better than the immobile solar PV system. © 2016 IEEE.","Dual-axis Tracker Arduino; Light Dependent Resistors; PV Panel","Cells; Cytology; Intelligent control; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photoresistors; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Power control; Power electronics; Resistors; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Absorption efficiency; Design and construction; Dual axis; Evaluation results; Light dependent resistor; PV panel; Solar photovoltaics; Solar tracking systems; Solar power generation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In this paper robust PID controller based on H∞ paradigm has been designed for voltage mode controlled buck converter with both variable input voltage and load variation. The controller design problem has been formulated as mixed sensitivity minimization problem and solved using bat algorithm. From the results obtained, the designed controller exhibits robust behavior by satisfying the robust stability criterion. The design and simulation has been carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK and results verify the robustness of the controller for large input voltage and load variations. © 2016 IEEE.","Bat Algorithm; Buck Converter; Continuous Current Mode; DC-DC Converters; Robust Control","Controllers; Electric control equipment; Electric inverters; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Power control; Power converters; Power electronics; Proportional control systems; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Stability criteria; Three term control systems; Bat algorithms; Buck converters; Constant load voltage; Continuous current modes; Controller designs; Current mode controllers; Design and simulation; Step-down dc-dc converters; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These sensors are deployed to accomplish various tasks e.g. to measure the environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity, pollution level of sea water; to monitor some ongoing activities such as surveillance, tracking of suspects; and etc. Also their batteries don't last very long since it requires continues transmission of data towards the user/customer/sink. Our main goal here is how to provide simple and effective approach to provide hybrid data compression (spatial and temporal both) in the wireless sensor network in order to improve energy efficiency of the network. WSNs are deployed in great amount over the detected environment and it has been observed that the data from neighboring sensors usually have large correlation so sometimes it is waste of energy for the transmission of this duplicate information from neighboring sensors rather we can exploit this spatial correlation to reduce the heavy burden of data in transmission. Besides it has been seen that on a particular sensor, their readings are also correlated for a limited duration so we can exploit this temporal correlation to reduce the amount of data. Our scheme is not suitable to real time data monitoring rather it is quite better for delay tolerant services as it requires a little time for processing of data before transmitting it to the sink. Neighboring correlated sensors forms a cluster and their data are collectively stored in two dimensional Matrix and afterwards, Compression techniques are applied in both domain (Space and Time). That's why it is termed as Hybrid Compression. After applying these compression methods the data are transmitted towards the sink. Our result shows that our proposed scheme gives satisfactory approximation of received data at the sink. © 2016 IEEE.","Auto Regressive Moving Average; Principal Component Analysis; Wireless Sensor Network","Data compression; Data handling; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Principal component analysis; Seawater; Water pollution; Autoregressive moving average; Compression techniques; Effective approaches; Energy efficient wireless sensor networks; Environmental attributes; Real-time data monitoring; Temporal correlations; Transmission of data; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

For its implementation, a least complex grid synchronization approach was used for the generation of parallel and orthogonal components of the grid voltage in an efficient manner using various computing techniques to generate a synchronized current reference value in the current control loop. An improved H6 single-phase inverter topology ensures the elimination of the common-mode leakage current in the transformer-less photovoltaic grid-connected system. In addition this topology is also capable of withstanding the low input voltage similar to full-bridge inverter without causing any fault. The H6 inverter topology allows both unipolar Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SINUSOIDAL PWM) as well as the bipolar (i.e. double frequency) SINUSOIDAL PWM control techniques for three-level output. Two additional switches are decoupled on the dc side for higher efficiency and convenient thermal design.

Since drug infusion is interacting type and sensitivity to drugs differs from patient to patient; so the appropriate controller design is challenging task. Therefore suitable controller is required to improve the patient care and also to minimize clinical expenses. Firstly; for tuning of PID controller gains conventional Ziegler Nichols (ZN) method is used. Later PID gains are optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with aggregation of Settling Time; Overshoot and Integral Square Error (ISE) as an objective function.

The traditional routing approaches are not able to perform up to the mark as they don't take into account many factors such as reducing delay, adaptive nature and so on. Thus there is a need for more sophisticated techniques to meet the current network problems. The problem solving nature of ant colonies have provided a new approach which inspired to solve these network problems. This paper focuses on Ant net algorithm based on Ant colony optimization which is an adaptive routing algorithm. In this approach, models of collective intelligence are transformed into optimization techniques. The ants travel across various paths in the network, thus depositing of pheromone, collecting route information and congestion.

There are several basic experiments in physics which help the students understand the basics of classical physics. However, the rising cost of laboratory infrastructure and costly equipment to conduct these experiments make it difficult for schools, in developing countries like India to build laboratories. This paper presents innovative web-based laboratory for physics to study equations of motion. One such experiment in equations of motion is the determination of acceleration due to gravity of a free falling object. However, measuring the distance traveled and time taken by a free-falling object is a tedious process. To overcome this challenge, a computer vision based system is presented which can measure the distance traveled and time taken by the object during free fall. By the technique of object detection in computer vision, the free-falling object is detected and tracked. The system is implemented using OpenCV libraries. The result of the analysis of free falling object is provided to the students through the web page. © 2016 IEEE.","Acceleration Due to Gravity; Dynamics Experiment; Object Detection; OpenCV","Computer vision; Developing countries; Equations of motion; Image processing; Intelligent control; Laboratories; Object recognition; Power control; Power electronics; Web crawler; Websites; Acceleration due to gravity; Classical physics; Hands-on laboratories; OpenCV; Physics experiments; Vision based system; Web based; Web based laboratories; Object detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Chances of failure increase with increase in electric stress on dielectric materials at high voltages. It is therefore; necessary to assess the electrical insulating properties of the materials before their practical use. This research work was aimed to determine different inherent properties of dielectric materials like volume resistivity; dielectric constant; loss tangent and co-relate them on an empirical basis by using variables predicted by basic theory. A simple equation to predict dielectric strength using ASTM electrode system; has been proposed for insulating materials like Leatheroid; Diamond dotted paper; Paper phenolic sheet; Glass bonded mica paper; Nomex and Epoxy resin fiber glass. Values of the parameters required in the equation may be obtained by performing non-destructive dielectric diagnostic measurements using an advance capacitance and tan delta bridge.

In this manuscript, a comparative study of different pattern recognition techniques using wavelet based features for islanding detection in distributed generation is presented. A system containing two DGs, one synchronous wind generator and an asynchronous hydro generator are taken into consideration. The model is simulated and wavelet transform is applied to extract the features like energy, entropy and standard deviation. Pattern recognition techniques including decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) and differential evolution (DE)-clustering are applied to segregate the islanding condition from non-islanding events like single line to ground fault, double line to ground fault, triple line to ground fault, load switching, capacitive switching, voltage sag, voltage swell and DG tripping. The comparative results show the effectiveness of each individual classifier for islanding detection in both noiseless and noisy environments.

Shunt active power filters (SAPF) are broadly implemented in power systems for mitigating the harmonic current component as well as to recompense imaginary or reactive power owing to their exact and reckless operation. The objective of this paper is to improve power quality through mitigating harmonics. This paper focuses on sinusoidal current based controller used in a shunt active power filter system (SAPF). Sinusoidal current control strategy is used to extract alternating (sinusoid) current commencing the source. The sinusoidal Currents, in addition with a stout synchronizing circuit (PLL circuit), custom a brief controller meant for shunt active filter. Power filter offers current compensation in such a manner that the shunt current drained from the system is sinusoidal and stable, analogous in the direction of the positive-sequence constituent of load current. SAPF is precise by a sinusoidal current control based controller in order to perform like a harmonic isolator among supply and load. Action of the shunt active filter under passive load conditions using non-linear load, the performance of the sinusoidal current control technique is evaluated using MATLAB R2015a. Total harmonic distortion (THD) of voltage as well as of current determines the practical feasibility of controller designed for shunt active filter to deliver a harmonic separation of passive loads. © 2016 IEEE.","Harmonic Current Compensation; PLL; Shunt Active Power Filter; Sinusoidal Current Control Strategy","Bandpass filters; Controllers; Electric current control; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Passive filters; Phase locked loops; Power control; Power electronics; Harmonic current compensations; Harmonics in power systems; Shunt active filters; Shunt active power filter (SAPF); Shunt active power filters; Sinusoidal currents; Synchronizing circuits; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Active filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Nowadays photovoltaic (PV) system are mostly recognized and widely used for different types of power system applications. Solar panels convert solar energy into electricity, if DC load is there it can be fed directly by panel through DC-DC converter and if alternating current (AC) load is there, which is mostly in residential and industrial applications, inverter is connected to DC-DC converter.

These converters are: non-isolated bi-directional buck converter (NBBC), non-isolated bi-directional boost converter (NBOC), non-isolated bi-directional fly back converter (NBFC), non-isolated bi-directional CUK converter (NBCC) and non-isolated bi-directional SEPIC converter (NBSC).In the renewable energy sources like PV and wind, wide input voltage variation due to the temperature and environmental conditions. Besides, production of renewable has been very less since it came in the field of power generation. Non-isolated dc-dc converters are suitable for low voltage range and it's fit for the dc micro grid voltage level. Moreover, either load side or source side get sporadic current in the primitive dc-dc converters and output voltage is negative with respect to the ground in CUK converter. Aforementioned problems are rectified by the non-isolated bi-directional SEPIC converter (NBSC). Items such as ideal efficiency, ripple factor of voltage, ripple factor of current, size and sophistication are calculated for them. On the other hand, their output current and voltages are obtained by the simulation with PSCAD software. A comprehensive comparison is done among these converter topologies on the basics of above mentioned items.

Oversizing leads to a decrease in operating efficiency & performance of the motor, and hence there is an opportunity for energy saving. Considering this fact, this paper proposes an Energy model and shaft torque estimation method for in-service Induction motor, with a mathematical formulation. The methodology for shaft torque estimation involves conducting No-load test and measurement of stator resistance, the tests can be conducted with minimal process disruption during regular maintenance shutdowns in the industry. Once these offline tests are completed, the operating efficiency and load can be estimated at any speed and shaft load when the machine is online, with minimal input parameters like RMS voltage, Line current and power factor, which are available on the Motor Control Centers (MCC). The shaft torque equations are validated on laboratory experimental setups, the experimental values are compared with the estimated value, and the results are presented.

One such domain is to find a path in an unknown and hostile environment to reach the goal. Due to the complexity of many tasks in this domain itis difficult for the robots (agents) to solve this with pre-programmed agent behaviors. Instead of using pre-programmed agent behaviors agents must discover a solution on their own by using learning. In simple reinforcement learning algorithms, a single agent learns how to achieve a goal through many episodes. But if complexity of learning problem is increased or the number of agents is more, it may lead to take more computation time in order to obtain the optimal policy and sometimes it may be the situation that it may not reach to the goal. For optimization problems, bio inspired multi-agent search methods such as particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization have been recognized to obtain a global optimal solution for multi-modal functions with wide solution space rapidly. This paper proposes a SARSA based reinforcement learning algorithm using one agent and two agents where the agents are guided by the pheromone levels also called the Phe-SARSA. In this algorithm agents learn through not only their respective experiences but also with the help of pheromone trail left by other agents to search for the shortest path.

The objective of feeder reconfiguration is to find the best possible radial network configuration in terms of minimum power loss. Feeder reconfiguration is the process of changing the topology of the network by changing the on/off status of both the tie as well as sectionalizing switches. PSO can be used as one of the approaches for finding the best optimal reconfigured system. But the basic PSO is designed for optimization of continuous function and reconfiguration is a problem of discrete and combinational optimization. Hence, the basic PSO is modified in this paper to fit into the problem statement. A shift operator has been incorporated in the velocity equation that changes the position of tie switches after each iteration such that the algorithm moves into the direction of finding the optimum result. The paper emphasizes the significance of voltage dependence of load on the reconfiguration studies.

This work systematically studies the impact of varying Q on the RMSE values of estimation errors for standard S-shaped maneuver often used to evaluate tracker-estimator performance for air traffic control (ATC) duty. RMS error performances for position and velocity estimation using both Uniform Motion (UM) model and Coordinated Turn (CT) model have been evaluated for standard, Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters. The study justifies the expectation that the higher order (but nonlinear) CT model would outperform the simpler, linear lower ordered UM model and quantifies the quantitative improvement in RMS error for various values of Q. It has been further demonstrated that by appropriate choice of Q, RMS error can be reduced substantially for both the models. The nominal S-shaped trajectory has been perturbed with random noise and Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out to evaluate the RMS errors.

This technologies help to meet peak electrical load demands by providing time varying energy management. Therefore, it can be suitably utilized to solve reactive power dispatch (RPD) problems. The RPD's are frequently associated with real power loss minimizations with dynamic voltage stability issues. The proposed RPD problems are commonly tackled by capacitor placements. Due to its static behavior, the capacitors are unable to provide desired results every time. In this context, SMES can generate the desired solutions. However, the SMES have also limited applications due to their higher installation and operating costs. Now, if the hybridized compensators involving capacitor and SMES are optimally chosen, the cost of operation reduces. In this work, hybrid capacitor-SMES based var compensation is utilized to solve the RPD problem. The sitting and sizing of the compensators are assigned by the Cuckoo Search Algorithm. The CSA based results showed the hybrid capacitor-SMES provided minimum 6.85 % power loss reduction w.r.t other meta-heuristics techniques.

The system control is such that it avoids battery overcharging or deep discharging by maintaining the battery SOC levels. This is facilitated by the Desired Power Control (DPC) of system algorithm which tracks the PV power according to the load requirements. Major drawback of control of the standalone system is management of excess PV power which is solved by using DPC without the use of dump loads which are difficult to manage.

The optimization scheme generates the optimal level of rotor flux for machine operation and improves the efficiency of the drive system by bringing down the IM core loss. The developed overall scheme is immune to the stator resistance variation. Moreover, the unique formation of the MRAS eliminates completely the requirement of any flux estimation.

Because of its high efficiency and availability, most of the three-wheeler EVs are driven by permanent magnet brushless dc (PM BLDC) motors. Lead acid and lithium-ion batteries can be used to power these EVs. A methodology to arrive at the motor and battery specifications of a typical three-wheeler EV for the selected drive cycle is given for the cases of direct drive and geared drive.

In order to repress this problem; usually a power system stabilizer is used. Performance of Conventional Power System Stabilizer (CPSS) will degrade due to any deviation from its quiescent operating state. Variations in system inertia constant; significantly play a role in causing the low frequency oscillations; which in turn affect the power system frequency. The inertia constant also affects the manner in which a disturbed system regains its steady state. So a robust PSS is required to achieve a good frequency stability for single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system; which can attain robustness against variations in inertia constant. This paper elucidates the; H∞ loop shaping method to design a PSS for a simplified Heffron-Phillips model of SMIB system. Designed robust PSS ensures the robustness of the system against parameter variation in inertia constant. It also ensures the stability and has superior oscillation damping capacity against system inertia constant. © 2016 IEEE.","H∞ Synthesis; Inertia Constant; Loop Shaping; Power System Stabilizer; Robust Power System Stabilizer; Single Machine Infinite Bus","Design; Energy transfer; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Robustness (control systems); Scheduling algorithms; Inertia constants; Loop-shaping; Power System Stabilizer; Robust power systems; Single machine infinite bus; System stability",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Traditional controllers exhibit innate performance deficiencies in the widely varying aerodynamic scenario with substantially elevated control efforts. Therefore nonlinear optimality based control would be vital for the overall system performance. The prime feature of Inverse Optimal Control is that it guarantees asymptotic stability and optimality, globally, with respect to a performance index determined posteriori. The basis of Inverse Optimal control (IOC) rests on the formulation of an appropriate Control Lyapunov Function (CLF), the determination of which is in fact laborious in most cases. However here, the determination of CLF, for a particular class of nonlinear systems, is systematized to some extent. The 6 DOF aircraft dynamics separated into two timescales is considered for simulation study. The slow angular dynamics of the outer loop is controlled via Inverse Optimal Control. A suboptimal Theta-D controller is employed for the control of the fast inner loop. Thus in effect a near optimal control performance is expected of the resultant nonlinear control system. The inherent stability and robustness characteristic of the participating control laws will contribute the same to the overall system.

To diagnose the disease, it needs to be segment the retinal area. In this paper, we have proposed the preprocessing and segmentation. Preprocessing is done on the original image using Gamma Normalization which brings the intensity value in a particular range. Gamma Normalization helps to enhance the image which gives better detail of the image. Then the segmentation is performed on the Gamma Normalized image. Segmentation is done by Superpixel method. Superpixel is the group of pixel into different regions which is based on compactness and regional size. Adaptive SLIC has been used for superpixalation. Adaptive SLIC is the algorithm for Superpixel generation which is use to set parameter adaptively for each Superpixel. Superpixel is used to decrease the difficulty of image processing task and supply suitable primitive image pattern.

They inject harmonics to the system and the normal delta-star distribution transformer traps the injected triple-n harmonics in the primary delta winding. This leads to the deterioration and reduction in the life of transformer. Hence, a three winding star-star-delta-utilized transformer is used to trap this harmonic or drainage power in the non-linear power system. This drainage power can be used to power auxiliary loads connected across the tertiary delta winding. Also, drainage power recovery makes the system performance better as triple-n harmonics are eliminated from supply line. For balanced and unbalanced secondary non-linear loads, the tertiary power can be recovered. Also, it can be stored in rechargeable batteries to power regulated loads. In this paper, the use of battery stored drainage power for the voltage regulation in shunt active filters is being discussed. The shunt active filter using Icosφ algorithm provides better harmonic elimination of non-linear load. When a load fluctuation occurs, the dc link capacitor voltage in the filter also fluctuates. Usually, the power needed for voltage regulation is supplied by the grid. In the proposed system, the drainage power stored in the battery is used for the voltage regulation. For using shunt active filter in the YYD-utilized transformer system, the control algorithm of the filter needs to be modified in order to sustain the triple-n harmonics in the system. The power recovered from triple-n harmonics can be stored in a battery and can be further used as the energy storage element of the filter. Results analyzed using MATLAB/SIMULINK reveals that the YYD-utilized system along with shunt active filter gives better utilization of drainage power and the overall system provides harmonic elimination. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery Stored Drainage Power; Modified Icos Algorithm; Shunt Active Filter (SAF); Star-star-delta-utilized Transformer (YYD-utilized Transformer)","Bandpass filters; DC transformers; Electric batteries; Electric transformers; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Recovery; Secondary batteries; Stars; Voltage regulators; Winding; Battery Stored Drainage Power; DC link voltage regulation; Dc-link capacitor voltages; Distribution transformer; Harmonic elimination; Primary delta winding; Shunt active filters; Star delta; Active filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In traditional hybrid microgrid, interlinking converter integrate AC and DC buses but, it cannot integrate storage system. It require more power conversions, device count to transfer power from one side to other side. It reduces power quality and overall efficiency of the system. The recent development in new power conversion circuit, can integrates multiple input and output. The use of these multi-port power converters in hybrid microgrids are integrating different DC source to centralized DC bus. These existing multi-port converts do not fulfill the requirement of DC-DC/AC power conversion to interface storage system with AC and DC buses.

Solar and wind power system controlled by WSN technologies has been also installed to meet the excess load demands.

Logistic Regression is generally used for binary classification however; multiclass classification has been achieved by using One-vs-All approach. Artificial neural networks are used for feed forward propagation to build the hypothesis function and back propagation is used for calculation of weights. The weights for both the models are minimized using advanced optimization algorithm such as fmiunc and fmincg. The formulas are implemented in vectorized format that is the formulas are solely expressed in matrix form and nowhere for loops are required. Vectorization does involve a lot of formulations to be done on paper beforehand but it ultimately serves the optimization purpose because higher programming languages such as MATLAB are very efficient to implement vectorized codes and this property should be exploited.

The inherent discrete nature of FCS-MPC is suitable for a converter fed direct torque control (DTC) of induction motor drive. This paper presents a comparative study between conventional DTC and finite control set model predictive direct torque control (FCS-MPDTC) for an induction motor drive. The conventional DTC offers fast dynamic response, however the presence of nonlinear controllers causes considerable torque and flux ripples. In this paper, a simple one step ahead FCS-MPDTC is used by considering stator flux and rotor flux as state variables. In this method, nonlinear controllers and heuristic switching table are replaced with a cost function based online optimization for the selection of suitable switching state. Further, a new cost function is introduced based on simple weighted sum method to eliminate the selection of weighting factors. The results are verified for both control techniques applied to a 6 kW squirrel-cage induction motor under different operating conditions using MATLAB/Simulink.

Many TFC have been proposed by the researchers out of which 7555 timer based SCC has been employed in several applications. The application of 7555 timer based SCC demands a method for generating the optimal circuit parameters yielding desired linearity and sensitivity for a given input temperature range. Two classical methods, namely, inflection point and three point methods have been employed by several researchers for this task. These classical methods, being simple in nature, offer moderate linearity and the residual non-linearity is normally further improved with the help of other supporting methods like software based techniques. In the present work, a linear numerical search based scheme is proposed to enhance the linearization capability of 7555 timer based SCC in TFC. The enhancement is attained by just selecting the appropriate value of a resistor in SCC application. The proposed method has been investigated in simulation on three different industrial grade thermistors for the input temperature range of 0°C-100°C for 7555 based SCC. An enhancement of linearity performances of 4.9%, 4.7% and 4.7% have been obtained over the three point method and 21.7%, 18.3% and 17.8% over the inflection point method for thermistor 1, thermistor 2 and thermistor 3, respectively. Based on these data it can be concluded that linear numerical search a promising solution for linearity enhancement of thermistors in 7555 SCC. The results presented in this work are useful to the design engineers as enhanced linearity also reduces the requirements of further processing. © 2016 IEEE.","7555-timer; Linear Numerical Search; Linearization; Signal Conditioning Circuit; Temperature Measurement; Thermistor","Intelligent control; Linear networks; Linearization; Power control; Power electronics; Strain measurement; Temperature measurement; Thermistors; Timing circuits; 7555-timer; Classical methods; Design engineers; Inflection points; Numerical search; Software-based techniques; Temperature range; Three-point methods; Signal conditioning circuits",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Therefore; large number of loops of different voltage levels has been created between substations. Transformers of different MVA ratings; percentage impedance and tap ratios have been installed at the substations. Presently there is no coordination between adjoining substation operators for tap setting of transformers. Therefore; due to mismatch of transformers tap ratio and percentage impedance; circulating MVARs are flowing on transmission lines resulting in higher transmission losses; increase loading of transformers & lines and poor voltage profile. In this paper impact of circulating MVAR flow and its control through coordinated tap setting of transformers has been studied.

The availability of 500 million metric tons of biomass per year in India makes it an inevitable option of energy which requires planning for opulence and environmental security of the nation. Techniques of soft computing like fuzzy logic are used for the precise energy modelling and policy formation. In this paper, a multi-attribute decision making model is proposed for selecting the best biomass usage on evaluating criteria like financial, technical, environmental and social aspect. The evaluated alternatives include bio-diesel, biogas, bio-ethanol, solid bio-fuels and bio-SNG. The evaluation process has been performed using MDL technique followed by VIKOR.

Apart from the conventional and non-conventional methods of generating power, researchers are finding other ways of utilizing the energy that is wasted in the environment in form of vibrations, pressure, heat, sound, etc. Thus, Energy harvesting from the environment comes out as a clean and sustainable way to power these devices. In this paper an attractive approach is proposed to harvest energy from human shoes particularly Soldier's shoe. A soldier carries numerous electronic gadgets for his mission which needs uninterrupted power supply. An alternative way is proposed here to power the Soldier's Electronic System or to recharge his batteries. This approach is implemented with the help of piezoelectric materials. The idea is to incorporate piezo polymers i.e. PVDF stacks beneath the heels of their shoes and generate electrical power merely by walking/running. This approach generates clean & green power which can even be stored for future use in absence of load. DC-DC converters were employed to maximize the electrical power from the material, to store it in a Super capacitor & to enhance the efficiency of the system. This power can be later utilized to power the soldier's electronics gadgets or and can also power a passive RF tag system for tracking soldier's in remote areas. © 2016 IEEE.","Buck-boost Converter; DSSH; Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Piezogenerator; PVDF","Crystallography; Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Energy harvesting; Intelligent control; Piezoelectricity; Power control; Power electronics; Sustainable development; Buck boost converter; DSSH; Low-powered devices; Non-conventional methods; Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Piezogenerator; PVDF; Uninterrupted power supply; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Despite of being robust in nature, it is subjected to various faults categorized as mechanical and electrical faults. A large extant of mechanical faults is due to the bearings which makes identification of malfunctions in nascent condition, a research area of higher importance. Motor Current Signature Analysis emerges as a valuable tool for the purpose. Further, for the purpose of signature extraction, Wavelet Transform also gained importance as a signal processing technique due to its well known property of Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA). It prevails over the major snag of frequency domain technique that is resolution problem. In this paper, stator current signal at no load condition is used for the purpose of fault diagnosis. Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is used as signal processing tool and artificially created signals are used to test formula while a set of damaged bearings is used to get the required data of fault conditions for testing the proposed methodology practically. Proposed analysis helps to identify the frequency band along with the axis of operation which can be under focus for the purpose of bearing fault detection.

PPG is a noninvasive circulatory signal related to the pulsatile volume in tissue according to the variation of the blood pumped by the heart. A PPG is obtained by using a pair of infrared transmitter and receiver. Infrared transmitter emits infrared light which is absorbed by the flowing blood in the finger. This absorbed light is reflected by the finger and detected by the infrared receiver. The signal received is small therefore balanced combination of resistors with capacitors are required for the clean extraction of the signal. The device consists of pair of these detector and receiver coupled with amplifier and filter circuit. The amplifier used here is LM386 operational amplifier. Amplifier is capable of amplifying 1000 times the signal received from the detector. As the signal obtained from the finger is small and weak this kind of amplification is necessary. Due to various stages of signal extraction and amplification unnecessary noise like amplification noise is introduced. To get rid of these noises a low pass RC filter circuit is used. RC filter circuit is tuned at 16 Hz to significantly remove the 16 Hz noise which is most prevalent in these kind of low signal devices. Cost of device is very low and Signal obtained can be used in variety of ways for the diagnosis of heart related diseases. © 2016 IEEE.","Diastolic Peak; Dicrotic Notch; LM386; Photoplethysmogram; Phototransistor; RC Filter; Systolic Peak","Amplification; Blood; Diagnosis; Extraction; Intelligent control; Operational amplifiers; Passive filters; Phototransistors; Power control; Power electronics; Signal detection; Transmitters; Diastolic Peak; Dicrotic notch; LM386; Photo-plethysmogram; RC filter; Systolic Peak; Biomedical signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

For linear time invariant processes, conventional PID controller is suitable but they have limitations when they are required to control the plants having high non linearity or their parameters are changing with the time. In order to find the parameters of PID controller, information regarding the dynamics of the plant is essential. If perturbation occurs in plant parameter(s) then PID controller may work only if these changes are not severe. But most plants are either non linear or their parameters changes with time and this demands for a use of more robust type of controller and ANN is a suitable candidate.

These distributed resources are owned by different organizations. Grid computing provides a framework for parallel/distributed computing. For developing a grid, low-level services (secure access management of resources) and high-level services (application development and scheduling) should be developed. Dynamic nature of resources in grid architecture is the reason for varied load on resources. So for better management of resources, the scheduling concept comes into account. Scheduling means order of jobs which satisfy the metrics like user's satisfaction and completion time & so on. Better scheduling policy in grid computing improves performance, cost of computation, load balancing and increase reliability and availability of resources. This paper presents various approaches for allocation of resources in grid computing environment.

Further, a dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC) has also been derived which is based on additional dynamics added to the switching surface. DSMC has relatively slow asymptotic convergence rate but shows good transient performance and hence helps in appreciating the performance of NFTSM in a better way. Performance of both these controllers have been compared with the results of already established non-singular terminal sliding mode control (NTSM) method.

This brought highly non-linear electric load profile that is difficult to forecast. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based forecasting models are always preferred over conventional models, because it is heuristic and adaptive approach to learn. In this paper, AI based Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is used to evolve half-hourly load forecasting model for a period of three days. This model is tested and validated on five Australian states' load data. Out of these five cases, forecasting accuracy in four cases is confined to 2.7233%; amongst these four cases two show the forecasting error less than 2%. In one case forecasting error is 6.4593%, which is acceptable because the state consumes lesser energy.

Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants.

The proposed method considers the variation in load levels and hence aims to minimize energy losses in the system by placement of DG. For maximum energy loss saving, the sizing of DG units is obtained by classical optimization technique. The developed method needs the solution of base case load flow only for execution.

In case of Wind Energy System (WES), power quality is challenging issue for grid connected system. Further there are challenges associated with extract of maximum power and reliability of supply.

This paper presents grid connected WES with source side control and grid side converter control. It further contains comparison between grid side conventional controller and TS fuzzy controller along with design of LCL filter. Control of the inverter has been done by Synchronous reference frame (SRF) scheme. The objective behind the grid side converter control is to evacuate the active power and reactive power from WSES. In case load requirement exceeds wind energy generation, the control architecture will ensure that remaining demand will meet through grid supply. Reactive power compensation of the load is done through the control algorithm. Working of proposed system is investigated under nonlinear, unbalance, varying load and with change in wind speed.

Typical mechanical faults have been observed owing to bearings in SCIM, thus considered one of the major reasons behind most of the motor malfunctions. Motor current signature extraction based analogies, plays an important role in detection and identification of factors causing imperfections in Induction Motors. Signature Extraction using Wavelet Transform with the property of Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) can be seen as a reliable tool, as it deals effectively with the problem of resolution. Transient time current during motor build up has an advantage that loading does not affect the amplitude of the start-up transient, hence processes based on start-up transient current enjoys benefits of no proposed based on signal energy by processing the transient time current data using Wavelet Packet Technique (WPT).For uniform scaled analysis of motor conditions, probability of %FS is used.

Using P/V droop controller; efficient load sharing among the converters with respect to their KVA rating is established. This controller however cause droop in voltage level of Busbar. To remove voltage droop due to increased power demand BVSC controller is used which is augmented with PID controller.

Additionally, three-phase, four-wire distribution systems faces poor power quality problems such as unbalanced loading, excessive neutral current and voltage distortion due to current harmonics. In order to keep the voltage within a limit and mitigate such power quality problems, reactive power compensation devices such as distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) are used as custom power devices which help in increasing the operational efficiency and reliability of power distribution systems. In a D-STATCOM, generally, the DC link capacitor voltage is regulated using a proportional integral (PI) controller along with various control algorithms used for load compensation. However, during load changes, there is considerable variation in DC link capacitor voltage which might affect compensation. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based supervisory method is presented to improve transient performance of the DC link. A mamdani fuzzy logic based controller is designed in such a way that the gains generated by the fuzzy supervisor are added to the reference proportional and integral gains of the PI controller which helps to maintain the DC Link voltage. A MATLAB/Simulink model for the system with a resistive inductive (R-L) load is developed using SimPower Toolbox. It is observed that the fuzzy logic supervised D-STATCOM successfully compensates for the reactive power required by the load. A transient (load throw off condition) is created by removing one of the phases of the load for a short duration. The DC link capacitor voltage is observed and compared to a case when only a conventional PI controller is used with no fuzzy supervision. It is observed that the proposed controller has a better performance than the conventional one in terms of better voltage regulation and faster settling time. © 2016 IEEE.","D-STATCOM; DC Link; Fuzzy Logic; PCC; Voltage Regulation","Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric current regulators; Electric power utilization; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Quality control; Reactive power; Static synchronous compensators; Two term control systems; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Voltage regulators; DC links; Dc-link capacitor voltages; DSTATCOM; Four-wire distribution systems; Fuzzy logic based controller; Proportional integral controllers; Reactive power compensation; Reactive power compensation device; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The advantage of MATLAB is, it is widely available, continuously updated and has wider reach. In our approach, mixed pixel areas are detected using super pixel segmentation of colour and depth, and consolidate them to lost pixel regions. The consolidated regions are replete with neighbouring depth information based on a Robust Edge-Stop (RES) Function; distance transform values of colour edge pixels are used to form this function.

In order to assess the impact of each color; prime focus is to detect different colors from EEG signals. This study employs four color stimuli; e.g. red; green; yellow and blue; that were shown to various subjects and EEG signal corresponding to the mentioned stimulus was acquired. Power spectral density of each color was estimated and different activation areas of brain for each stimulus is illustrated in figures.

Wheeling prices are supposed to be distributed over transmission users. Allocation of wheeling prices means determination of distribution of wheeling prices among transmission users and this depends upon the contribution of each user in total transmission investment cost. The contribution of transmission user in total transmission cost is decided either by transmission owner or by Regulatory body. In real world scenario, the contribution of producers and customers in cost, may be variable because it depends upon the demand supply relation. This paper presents a new approach of wheeling price allocation among transmission users by applying different level of contribution of each transmission user in total transmission investment. This enables the allocation of wheeling prices for any amount of contribution of generator and load in transmission investment. The proposed approach has been illustrated on Garver's 6-bus test system and IEEE RTS 24-bus system. This has been observed that the perspective presented in this paper is capable of recovering fixed transmission cost for varying amount of contribution of transmission users. © 2016 IEEE.","DC-OPF; GGDF; GLDF; MW-km Method; Postage Stamp Method; Power Flow Tracing; Wheeling Prices","Costs; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Intelligent control; Investments; Light transmission; Power control; Power electronics; DC-OPF; GGDF; GLDF; MW-km Method; Postage stamp methods; Power flow tracing; Wheeling prices; Electric power transmission",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Due to hysteresis characteristics of current transformer primary current cannot be replicated accurately into secondary current. Hysteresis characteristics of CT cause an exciting current which is main source of error. In industrial environment load current contains considerable amount of DC offset current and harmonics. Accuracy of CT is dependent upon residual flux in the core and DC offset. In this software compensation scheme instantaneous values of secondary current are sensed with the current sensor. From this sensed secondary current instantaneous flux is calculated which after inserting flux-exciting current loop gives calculated exciting current. Calculated Exciting current is added to the secondary current which gives more accurate secondary current. Effect of DC offset in the load current is neglected in this scheme but harmonics are considered. A more detailed study of DC offset is in progress in this compensation scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Transformers; Hysteresis","Electric instrument transformers; Electric transformers; Error compensation; Errors; Hysteresis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Compensation scheme; Error compensation methods; Hysteresis characteristics; Industrial environments; Instantaneous value; Measurement current transformer; Potential transformer; Software compensation; Electric currents",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Choosing the dimensions while being critical is also extremely complex primarily due to complex mathematical formulations at the submicron level. Thus, it is required to employ techniques to simplify the dimensioning process while still keeping the parameters under check. This study presents one such novel technique to estimate the transistor dimensions for a current to voltage converter structure, using the artificial neural networks approach. The approach uses Multilayer perceptrons as the artificial neural network architectures. The technique involves a two-step process.

These inertial sensors, however, suffer from errors and noise which need to be calibrated and compensated, respectively. With growing use of low cost MEMS based inertial sensors in autonomous vehicles, it is desired to calibrate these systems online and infield without requiring any external equipment. The in-field calibration schemes are based on the simple principle that the norms of the accelerometer triads equals the magnitude of the Earth's gravity. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization scheme and few of its variants are used for estimating bias, scale and non-orthogonality parameter for an uncalibrated accelerometer. The proposed scheme provides a matrix of unknown parameters which can be fed to obtain calibrated sensor readings.

Undoubtedly, the soft switching reduces the power loss in the Main switch while improving the overall EMI in the converters. This facilitates the increase of switching frequency of converters. This paper highlights a design methodology for the transformer in a fly back converter, which automatically accomplishes the complete soft switching of the main switch. No extra circuit or the control scheme is needed to attain Zero Current Turn On and total Zero Voltage Switching (both during turn ON and Turn OFF) of the Main MOSFET switch. Also, it eliminates the Dissipative snubber which is an essential component in fly back converter. However, this scheme is wholly applicable to fixed Input and constant load applications. Nevertheless, most of the Industry scenarios are similar at low power range of about 50 to 100 watts, because invariably the DC-DC converters are operated from a Power factor correction module (Whose output is fairly regulated to around 400V DC) and the output load is constant. The design concept is demonstrated on a 60 watt fly back converter operating from a 400V DC bus and operated at 100 KHz. © 2016 IEEE.","Complete Energy Transfer; Fly Back Converter; Soft Switching; Transformer Design","DC-DC converters; Design; Electric inverters; Energy transfer; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Switching; Zero current switching; Zero voltage switching; Control schemes; Design concept; Design Methodology; Dissipative snubbers; Flyback converters; MOSFET switches; Power factor corrections; Transformer design; Power converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Cell shows drastic changes in cell morphology and cell size during directed-migration as well as random migration. While understanding the mechanism through which a cell controls its shape/size can play a significant role in improving our understanding of biological systems, the involvement of multiple length/time scales make the experimental exploration of the mechanism very difficult. In the past few decades, control theoretic approaches/tools have proven to be a great facilitator of study and development of cell biology. In this study, we present a simple spring-bead model of a cell to study it's shape and size dynamics during cell migration. The model incorporates the effect of plasma membrane tension, internal pressure and chemoattractant forces on the cell dynamics. In spite of having a significantly lesser number of model parameters, our model recapitulates many features of a real cell including cell polarization, cell cringing, steering, gradient sensing and directed migration.

Among the renewable energy solutions, solar energy is the very vital source that can be used to generate power. Electricity from the sun can be converted through photovoltaic (PV) module. The efficiency of solar module depends on sun intensity, if the intensity is more then efficiency is more. Since the position of sun continuously changes throughout the day, the intensity of sun rays is not uniform on PV module. So, for getting more sun rays on PV module solar tracker plays a much vital role. A solar tracker is a device for operating a solar photovoltaic panel, especially in solar cell applications and requires high degree of accuracy to ensure that the concentrated sunlight is dedicated precisely on to the power device. This paper describes in detail about the design, development and fabrication of two Prototype Solar Tracking Systems mounted with a single-axis and dual-axis solar tracking controllers to generate 10.3 volts, 1.5 watts capable of charging mobile batteries. The rays from the sun should fall perpendicularly onto the solar panels to maximize the capture of the rays and this is done by pointing the solar panels towards the sun and following its path across the sky. The solar tracking systems - Tilted Single Axis Tracker (TSAT) and Azimuth-Altitude Dual Axis Tracker (AADAT) are designed, implemented and experimentally tested. The design details of TSAT and AADAT are described which detect the sunlight using Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors. The control circuit for the systems is based on Atmega8 Microcontroller which is programmed to detect the sunlight through the LDR sensors and then actuate the DC geared motor using L293D motor driver to position the solar panel where it can receive the maximum sunlight. © 2016 IEEE.","AADAT; Photovoltaic Module; Solar Energy; Solar Tracker; TSAT","Controllers; Electric machine control; Energy policy; Intelligent control; Photoresistors; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power electronics; Solar cell arrays; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Tracking (position); AADAT; Atmega8 microcontrollers; Light dependent resistor; Photovoltaic modules; Solar photovoltaic panels; Solar tracker; Solar-cell applications; TSAT; Solar power generation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Unlike traditional line sensors which work on black surfaces with a white line or vice versa, this sensor is designed to differentiate white line on any coloured surface. Thus this sensor can be implemented in robotics applications or in industries where different section's floors are assigned with different colours and robot navigates using line following. The system was implemented using light emitting diodes, phototransistor and an onboard microcontroller Arduino Mega 2560 which communicates with any navigation control system using serial communication. Moving average filters are implemented per channel to remove the fluctuations in the readings due to vibration of the sensor during locomotion. It then gives the error feedback or the offset of the white line from the centre, to the system that is corrected using Proportional-Integral-Derivative algorithm. It also takes care of non scaled readings of the line sensors due to ambient light by having separate threshold values for individual sensors making each sensor independent. The main aim of this paper is to highlight the use and need of a line following sensor capable of differentiating any background colours with white line and at different light conditions. Performance metrics were measured and compared to show tradeoffs between cost and performance. © 2016 IEEE.","Advanced Line Sensor; Auto Calibration; Coloured Surfaces; Moving Average Filter; Phototransistor; PID","Calibration; Intelligent control; Light emitting diodes; Machine design; Phototransistors; Power control; Power electronics; Robots; Two term control systems; Auto calibration; Design and implementations; Line sensor; Moving average filter; Navigation control systems; Proportional integral derivatives; Robotics applications; Serial communications; Proportional control systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Features of the proposed WECS include three concave rotating wind vanes situated at the external periphery of the turbine and a hybrid design of VAWT resulting in optimum tip speed ratio (TSR). Venturi effect is produced by dynamically altering the angles of the flaps by closed loop mechanism. The vanes shield the turbine from high velocity winds & augment its performance in low velocity winds. The proposed FIS approach is to approximate the power curve by using an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system based on Sugeno model that uses the wind speed and Guide Vane's angle as the inputs and the mechanical power as the output. A hardware prototype of the WECS is used for collecting training data for different guide vane's angle and wind speed conditions.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique promises to deliver high data rate with simple receiver structure. It is more spectral efficient and has been recommended to be used by many standards. But it has one major disadvantage of having high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). High PAPR drives the power amplifier in saturation region and causes it to operate in nonlinear region with reduced efficiency. There are several techniques to reduce PAPR of OFDM system. In this paper we have done FPGA implementation of selective mapping method (SLM) for PAPR reduction for 4 QAM baseband signal for 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 number of subcarriers. The result obtained have been compared with PAPR values obtained through mathematical analysis and Matlab simulations and also with original signal. For 1024 number of subcarriers at 10-3 of CCDF value the PAPR value obtained with hardware implementation is 9.8 dB which is 2.8 dB less form the original OFDM signal obtained without applying SLM technique but 0.9 dB higher than the Matlab simulated value.

Each of this controller is equipped with a tuning parameter that has a transparent relationship with the closed loop servo behaviour.

College of Engineering, Thisayanvilai, India","The output of a photovoltaic panel depends on its position with respect to the sun at any instant of time. To extract the maximum power from the panel, tracking systems are generally used for positioning it at an optimal angle. However, in case of solar farms, where a large number of panels are concentrated in a single area, implementing tracking sensors on each panel is not economical. Further, the maintenance of the same is cumbersome. Under practical conditions, due to external factors such as the temperature, perpendicular positioning of solar panels with respect to the sun may not yield maximum power. This paper presents the design of a control for a solar array using an auxiliary panel for tracking the point of maximum output power, rather than placing the panels perpendicular to the sun. The auxiliary panel tracks the point of maximum power and transmits the co-ordinates to the controller, which in turn moves the array to the appropriate position. This tracking system is automatically switched off during cloudy and rainy periods, when the tracking system does not produce any significant change in the output power. Further, this system eliminates the need for initial calibration as required in existing tracking systems. Experimental results prove that the power consumed by the proposed tracking algorithm is significantly lower than that consumed by conventional trackers. © 2016 IEEE.","Auxiliary Panel; Dual Axis; Solar Tracking","Intelligent control; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power electronics; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Tracking (position); Auxiliary Panel; Dual axis; External factors; Maximum output power; Photovoltaic panels; Solar tracking; Tracking algorithm; Tracking system; Solar cell arrays",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Capacity factor is a parameter widely used for matching wind turbines with a windy site with its high value desired. A high capacity factor ensures low cost of wind energy conversion system. In addition to this availability factor is another parameter of performance index of a wind turbine. A High value of availability factor indicates that wind turbine is operational most of the time. Availability factor is important because the decision of licensing agencies may depend on it in order to support the operational planning of the utility in the area. For a wind energy site these factors depends on speed ratings of the wind turbine i.e. cut-in speed, rated speed and cut-out speed. But these parameters have different effects on capacity factor and availability factor under different conditions. In this paper an attempt has been made to analyze such effect using fifteen wind turbines.

Equalizers can be fruitfully utilized to minimize this error. Since the channel condition is always dynamic, the coefficients of the equalizer have to be set in an adaptive manner. This leads to the necessity of using Adaptive Equalizer (AE) in the communication system. Efficient optimization techniques add up an extra dimension to it. In this regard, a novel Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) based Adaptive Equalizer (AE) has been proposed in this paper to minimize the channel errors with minimum number of iterations. The convergence behavior of the adaptive algorithm has been studied to establish the effectiveness of our proposition. Moreover, the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the proposed adaptive equalizer has been studied which shows considerable improvement over the entire range of SNR. Finally, the superiority of the proposed FPA optimized Adaptive Equalizer has been established over the existing techniques like Least-Mean-Square (LMS) and Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) based Adaptive Equalizer in terms of convergence as well as BER performance. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive Equalizer; BER; Constant Modulus Algorithm; Flower Pollination Algorithm; Least-Mean-Square Algorithm","Adaptive algorithms; Bit error rate; Error statistics; Errors; Intelligent control; Optimization; Power control; Power electronics; Random errors; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Adaptive equalizer; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Constant modulus algorithms; Convergence behaviors; Least mean square (LMS); Least mean square algorithms; Optimization techniques; System imperfections; Equalizers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Since PV system provides an unregulated voltage output, it is regulated to a desired voltage level and then given to the charge controller, which distributes the power between battery and load. To extract acme power from PV system, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) scheme is employed. The excess energy left, after meeting the load demand, is stored in the battery. The stored energy is utilized to meet the future load demands, when there is a power deficit from the PV system. Hence power requirement of the load is managed. Also a comparison between the three commonly used MPPT techniques: Perturb & Observe (P&O) algorithm, Incremental Conductance (IC) algorithm and Fractional Open Circuit Voltage (FOCV) algorithms is done and the most suitable technique is employed for the hybrid system. When the battery is fully charged, the excess power is absorbed by the dump load, which is also managed by the charge controller.

It was observed that driving harshness has a great impact on the regeneration efficiency during vehicle deceleration. On the other hand, to reduce the trip time as well as to avoid accident, the deceleration duration needs to be kept short. By realizing these conflicting objectives, in the present work an optimal deceleration is find out for a speed change using a genetic algorithm. The concerned multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) was solved based on two approaches: considering a constant deceleration, and variable decelerations during braking. Comparative results of both the approaches are presented for a representative speed change in four driving cycles. Results of both approaches in solving the MOOP including under certain constraints, such as a desired comfort journey and maintaining a safe braking distance, suggest that multiple decelerations should be used during planned braking, where as either a constant or multiple deceleration may be taken during braking for high comfort journey and under emergency braking demand. © 2016 IEEE.","Comfort; Energy; Genetic Algorithm; Multi-objective Optimization; Optimal Deceleration; Regenerative Braking; Trip Time","Braking; Crashworthiness; Deceleration; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent control; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Power control; Power electronics; Vehicles; Comfort; Conflicting objectives; Energy; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Regeneration efficiency; Trip time; Vehicle deceleration; Regenerative braking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Hence, it is necessary to limit the harmonics to meet IEEE: 519-2014 harmonic standard. To reduce the harmonic currents, the simplest method is to utilize the passive filters generally known as Harmonic Traps. However, passive filters alone cannot eliminate all harmonic components. Besides, there are limitations on the use of passive filtering. Hence, hybrid filtering technique incorporating passive and active filters is the solution for the present power electronic systems. The active filters may be connected either in series or parallel with the mains. Hybrid harmonic filter considered in this paper is an effective solution for harmonic mitigation and its effective implementation.

As a result many small generators are being connected at the distribution level, in order to supply a reliable and sustainable power to select customers. These generators transform the distribution systems into micro-grids which would work either in autonomous or non-autonomous modes. It becomes mandatory to connect renewable and dispatchable sources in case of a hybrid power system for supplying the connected loads without intermittency.

The twin problem of placement of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) for observability and placement of dynamic controllers for controllability are solved separately using different techniques. The selected signals are applied as input and output respectively for the centralized Wide area controller. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based coherency identification method has been adopted for selection of signals for observability, while a novel attempt has been made to apply the method of dimension reduction by Sequential Orthogonalisation (SO) for the selection of signals for controllability. A simple damping controller circuit that takes inputs from wide area signals is considered for controlling the inter-area oscillatory modes using the conventional power system controllers. The objective of the study is to determine the applicability and effectiveness of existing traditional damping devices with Wide Area inputs, in complex power systems such as Indian grid, with only traditional controllers. The focus of this study is on inter-area oscillatory modes, for which the modified 39-bus New England Test System (NETS) has been taken as test case.

The system consists of multiple agents having varying velocities and second-order dynamics. At any instant the group has one leader. All agents follow this leader, based on the observation of the position and velocity of the leader by a subset of the number of agents. Agents within the communication radius of other agents are able to establish connection and communicate with each other, either the position of the leader and/or the velocity of the leader. In this paper, we propose an energy-level based election of leader for flocking trajectory control under faulty leader. All agents compute certain energy. Agent that has the least energy is elected leader. A leader fault identification method has been developed, based on graph theory, applied to communication establishment. The leader is isolated as faulty if the agents within the communication neighbourhood of the leader are unable to interact with the leader. Under, these circumstances, these agents call for an election of leader, and the elected leader has the least energy amongst the rest. Regardless of isolation of the current leader and election of a new leader, the agents will converge to the desired trajectory. © 2016 IEEE.","election strategy; energy; flocking trajectory control; Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)","Graph theory; Intelligent control; Multi agent systems; Power control; Power electronics; Trajectories; Communication radius; Desired trajectories; election strategy; energy; Fault identifications; Flocking algorithms; Second-order dynamics; Trajectory control; Intelligent agents",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Wireless power can be achieved across large air gap which will be backbone for the future automation industry. This paper presents the analysis, design and simulation studies of the CLC based Resonant Dual Active Bridge (RDAB) topology for the inductive wireless power transfer application in the hybrid electric vehicle. The main advantage of RDAB topology to the Conventional Dual Active Bridge (DAB) topology is the requirement of less reactive power due to the 'Resonance' created by CL (capacitor + inductor) circuit in the primary and a Capacitor in the secondary side of the high frequency transformer. The bridge current (switch current) is reduced due to the low reactive power and it helps in achieving high efficiency due to reduction in the conduction loss as well as power factor of the model. Reactive power is supplied by the capacitor in the primary side of the transformer. RDAB also provides Zero Voltage Switching at wide range of load. The complete system is analyzed and simulated in PSIM 9.1. The details analysis, simulation studies and comparison of the RDAB topology with the conventional dual active bridge topology is presented in the paper. © 2016 IEEE.","Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Inductive Power Transfer; PSIM; Resonant Dual Active Bridge; Soft Switching","Energy transfer; High frequency transformers; Hybrid vehicles; Inductive power transmission; Intelligent control; Power converters; Power electronics; Reactive power; Topology; Zero voltage switching; Automation industry; Design and simulation; Dual active bridge converter; Dual active bridges; Inductive power transfer; Performance analysis; PSIM; Wireless power transfer; Power control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The wind energy conversion system consists of a wind turbine coupled to DFIG (Double Fed Induction Generator) equipped with MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking). The MPPT demands speed control which is realized using vector control of the rotor side converter. The voltage and frequency control is achieved through load side converter connected to the common DC bus. Solar PV power is fed to the same DC bus using DC-DC boost converter which is also equipped with MPPT algorithm to extract maximum energy from the incident solar energy. The system is modeled in Sim-Power System tool of MATLAB and its performance under all the practical conditions e.g. varying wind speed and radiation; unbalanced and nonlinear load is presented. Under all these conditions; the stator currents flowing through DFIG are balanced and sinusoidal. The harmonics in load voltage under all conditions are within requirement of IEEE 519 standard. The scheme doesn't envisage measurement of any mechanical quantities e.g. wind speed or rotor position.

Wind energy has been a major source of energy for the society for the past thousand years. Wind energy is a clean and pollution free energy source which can be relied up on for the long-term future. A wind turbine creates cost-effective, pollution free, reliable sources of energy. A single wind turbine is sufficient for the generation of energy which is required by a household. Wind turbines generates power without the usage of fossil fuels, neither have they produced greenhouse gases nor they generate radioactive or toxic waste. There is always a significant need for better sources of energy that is long term reliable. The dependence on conventional sources of energy must be reduced, better and renewable sources of energy must be investigated and should be brought into use. There are various factors affecting the energy generation using wind turbines such as wind parameters which are natural and the turbine parameters. The wind turbine design and its dimensions are one of the major factors affecting the output voltage generated by the wind turbines. The wind turbine blades design includes the pitch angle, the blade length, the width of the blade, weight and the aerodynamic modeling of the blades. Therefore it is necessary to study the effect of all these parameters on the output voltage generated by the conventional type of horizontal axis wind turbines.

Most of them have been limited to commercial applications such as vehicular tracking (e.g tracking of a train etc). However, not much work has been done towards design of a personal tracking system. Our Research work is an attempt to design such personal tracking system. In this paper, we have shared glimpses of our research work. The objective of our research project is to design & develop a system which is capable of tracking and monitoring a person, object or any other asset of importance (called as target). The system uses GPS to determine the exact position of the target. The target is aided with a compact handheld device which consists of a GPS receiver and GSM modem. GPS receiver obtains location coordinates (viz. Latitude & Longitude) from GPS satellites. The location information in NMEA format is decoded, formatted and sent to control station, through a GSM modem. Due to use of Open CPU development platform, no external Microcontroller is required, with additional advantage of compact size product, reduced design & development time and reduced cost. Thus, the proposed system is able to track the accurate location of target. This system finds applications in tracking old-age people, tracking animals in forest, tracking delivery of goods etc. Our final designed system is a small-size compact 1.5""X3.75"" Tracker system with position accuracy error <30m (100 feet). © 2016 IEEE.","AT Commands; GPS; GSM; Navigation; NMEA; OpenCPU; Tracking","Contracts; Global system for mobile communications; Intelligent control; Location; Modems; Navigation; Power control; Power electronics; Product design; Surface discharges; Target tracking; Tracking (position); AT command; Commercial applications; Design and implementations; Development platform; Location information; NMEA; OpenCPU; Position accuracy; Global positioning system",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Meanwhile, achieve this purpose emission value and fuel cost should be as less as possible. An allowable deviation in fuel cost and feasible tolerance in fuel cost has been called emission constrained economic dispatch (ECED) problem. A new nature-inspired Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is based on concept of bubble-net hunting strategy is applied to solve ECED problem. ECED is a multi-criteria problem can transformed to single criteria using price penalty factor method. In this paper quadratic function together with emission value and fuel cost are considered as individual objective makes it multi-criteria problem.

The estimation of battery parameters deploys experimental methods that are expensive, require high computational power and are time-consuming. Hence, two commonly used equivalent circuit battery models are tested using GA, PSO, ASMO and DE optimization techniques. Estimation has been done by the estimated voltage curves closeness to the known catalog voltage curve. Feasibility of various optimization techniques is evaluated by the accuracy of predicted model and the rate of convergence in predicting the model parameters. Investigation showed that DE algorithm has the best accuracy among meta-heuristic optimizers for battery parameter estimation for first order model while ASMO has best accuracy for the second order model. Further analysis showed that for both the models, DE algorithm was reliable as well as computationally less expensive compared to other optimization techniques. Also the second order RC model proved out to be more robust as for almost all scenarios the performance of optimization algorithm improved by use of this model. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery Electric Vehicle; Equivalent Models; Meta-Heuristics Techniques; Parameter Estimation","Battery electric vehicles; Battery management systems; Circuit simulation; Electric batteries; Equivalent circuits; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Intelligent control; Lithium-ion batteries; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power control; Power electronics; Secondary batteries; Timing circuits; Equivalent circuit model; Equivalent model; Experimental methods; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic techniques; Optimization algorithms; Optimization techniques; Rate of convergence; Parameter estimation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The localization challenge has been posed as a multidimensional global optimization problem in earlier literature. Many swarm intelligence algorithms have been proposed for accurate localization. The untapped vast potential of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has inspired the research presented in this paper. The ABC algorithm has been investigated as a tool for anchor-assisted sensor localization in WSNs. Results of Matlab simulation of ABC-based multistage localization have been presented. Further, the results are compared with those of the localization method based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. A comparison of the performances of ABC and PSO algorithms has been presented in terms of the number of nodes localized, localization accuracy and the computation time. The results show that the ABC algorithm delivers higher accuracy of localization than the PSO algorithm does; but, it takes longer to converge. This results in a trade off between speed and accuracy of localization in WSNs. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; MATLAB; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; Swarm intelligence; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Global optimization problems; Localization accuracy; Monitoring and tracking; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042401,,,"English","IEEE Symp.

However, these systems accommodate both the request-to-send data process and the confirmation-to-send data process in the same data transmission scheduling window (i.e. data window). This reduces the length of the multi-hop flow setup in the data window. In a multi-hop scenario, this degrades both the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD). In this paper, we propose a cross-layer contention based synchronous MAC protocol, which accommodates the request-to-send data process in the data window and the confirmation-to-send data process in the sleep window for increased efficiency. We evaluate our proposed protocol through ns-2.35 simulations and compare its performance with the PRMAC protocol.

Forest fire detection is one of the most safety-critical application. In certain situations, sensor node may give incorrect data due to some faults in it. Since the network is unaware of the fault, it might lead to a serious problem. So, our objective is to detect the faulty nodes as well as the probability of fire to reduce the disastrous loss.

In either case, it is imperative to compute the optimum number of nodes to be deployed such that they collectively satisfy spatial and temporal sampling of the network area. This can be quantified in terms of a critical quality of service (QoS) parameter-Network coverage. Deterministic approach is considered to be straightforward wherein number of nodes to be deployed is estimated using simple geometrical computations assuming disk based binary sensing model. However, the effective sensing radius of a node is affected by sensing device characteristics and environmental factors which leads to non-uniform sensing. These factors are stochastic in nature and can be modeled using probabilistic sensing models. In this paper, we investigate the effect of probabilistic sensing models on the required number of nodes to be deterministically deployed using a square grid based scheme in order to attain a given percentage coverage. The analysis highlights the need for consideration of an appropriate sensing model along with the suitable parametric values for estimation of required number of nodes to be deployed for desired coverage. This study based on sensing models can be taken up as a guideline for estimation of the appropriate number of sensor nodes to be deterministically deployed to design, evaluate and implement an effective WSN. © 2016 IEEE.","deterministic deployment; network coverage; probabilistic sensing models; wireless sensor networks (WSN)","Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Critical quality; Deterministic approach; Deterministic deployment; Environmental factors; Network coverage; Probabilistic sensing models; Sensing devices; Temporal sampling; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015362584

Smart air pollution monitoring consists of wireless sensor nodes, server and a database to store the monitored data. Huge amounts of data are generated by gas sensors in air pollution monitoring system. Traditional methods are too complex to process and analyze the voluminous data. The heterogeneous data are converted into meaningful information by using data mining approaches for decision making. The K-Means algorithm is one of the frequently used clustering method in data mining for clustering massive data sets. In this paper, enhanced K-Means clustering algorithm is proposed to analyze the air pollution data. The correlation coefficient is calculated from the real time monitored pollutant datasets. The Air Quality Index (AQI) value is calculated from the correlation co-efficient to determine the air pollution level in a particular place. The proposed enhanced K-Means clustering algorithm is compared with Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) clustering algorithm in terms of accuracy and execution time.

Agriculture is one of the biggest industries where the cost-effective wireless sensor technology is effectively applied to support its functions. Clustering is one of the ways to achieve energy efficiency in such networks. In clustered network, few nodes play the role of cluster heads, summative the data from their members, and pass on them to the sink for further processing.

Chain leader (CL) for each cluster chain is selected based on its residual energy and proximity to base station (BS).

The farm areas near the forest edges are prominently affected by the wild animal attacks. This paper presents the development of a Wireless Sensor Network application for Crop Protection to divert animal intrusions in the crop field. The nodes in the crop field are equipped with PIR sensors, sound generating devices, light flashers and RF module. For early detection of the animal at the perimeter of the farm intrusion detection system is installed. Animal entry at the farm boundary is detected by the nodes fixed at the boundary and is communicated to the central base station.

The algorithm is an extension of centralized Isomap and is capable of effectively localizing new nodes progressively, without neglecting preceding computational results. In the initial startup phase, sensor nodes within two hop range of three non-collinear anchor nodes are localized using range (ϵ)-Isomap. Afterwards, in the progressive phase, the remaining nodes are localized in a sequential manner, using recently localized nodes. The localization process initiated at different nodes in the network give rise to the overlapping substructures of localized nodes. The overlapped substructures are stitched to form a single coordinate system. Finally, Helmert Transformation is used to obtain the global coordinates of the nodes. The effects of varying various parameters on the accuracy and scalability of the proposed algorithm are studied through the simulation.

However, in a two-tiered cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving data from their member sensor nodes, aggregating them and transmitting that data to the base station (BS). Therefore, proper selection of CHs and optimal formation of clusters play a crucial role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient CH selection and energy balanced cluster formation algorithms, which are based on novel chemical reaction optimization technique (nCRO), we jointly called these algorithms as novel CRO based energy efficient clustering algorithms (nCRO-ECA). These algorithms are developed with efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and potential energy functions. For the energy efficiency, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes in the CH selection phase. In the cluster formation phase, we consider various distance and energy parameters. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs by varying number of sensor nodes and CHs.

However, newly developed soft computing based techniques can provide solution. In order to have advantages of conventional and heuristic soft computing based control techniques, in this paper various commonly used intelligent techniques, neural network, fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been combined with sliding mode controller (SMC). For validation, proposed hybrid control schemes have been implemented for tracking a predefined trajectory by robotic manipulator, incorporating structured and unstructured uncertainties in the system. After reviewing numerous papers, all the commonly occurring uncertainties like continuous disturbance, uniform random white noise, static friction like coulomb friction and viscous friction, dynamic friction like Dhal friction and LuGre friction have been inserted in the system. Various performance indices like norm of tracking error, chattering in control input, norm of input torque, disturbance rejection, chattering rejection have been used. Comparative results show that with almost eliminated chattering the intelligent SMC controllers are found to be more efficient over simple SMC. It has also been observed from results that ANFIS based controller has the best tracking performance with the reduced burden on the system.

Mobility modeling and fault tolerance with respect to underwater characteristics are extremely difficult. In this energy constraint network, an adaptive localization scheme with minimum communication and GPS support is required. We propose a fault-resilient localization scheme, which provides good localization accuracy with minimal communication overhead. To resile from an anchor node failure, a sensor node predicts its position by learning the mobility behavior of its neighbors using multiple linear regression. Therefore, the data dissemination process can continue even after an unexpected case of anchor node failure. We simulate the network and analyze the localization accuracy. Several experiments with different test cases are conducted to analyze the validity of the location prediction system. Experimental results show that the last 10 location information from three immediate neighbors are adequate for accurate prediction and the localization scheme is well suited for medium-range UWSNs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Fault tolerance; Localization; Multivariate linear regression; Reference point group mobility; Underwater sensor networks","Fault tolerance; Global positioning system; Linear regression; Sensor networks; Communication overheads; Environmental characteristic; Group mobility; Localization; Mobility of sensor nodes; Multiple linear regressions; Multivariate linear regressions; Underwater sensor networks; Sensor nodes","Das, A.P.; College of EngineeringIndia; email: anjanapdas@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995773058

It involves the issues related to energy and dynamic spectrum inherited by WSN and cognitive radio network (CRN) respectively. CRSN poses research challenges in designing an efficient topology control for communication in network. In this paper, we propose an event-driven cluster based routing approach for CRSN that jointly considers both the energy and dynamic spectrum challenges. Reported schemes for CRSN suffer from high frequency of re-clustering due to PU activities and are energy inefficient. The proposed scheme employs a self-organized distributed clustering to obtain less average node power by producing the optimal number of clusters. To mitigate the effect of PUs' activities, our proposed scheme forms clusters having more number of common channels. To enhance inter-cluster connectivity, our proposed scheme selects gateway nodes having more number of common channels with neighboring nodes. Furthermore, a cluster-head (CH) rotation mechanism is employed that picks the CH based on nodes' residual energy values, available channels, neighbors and distance to the sink in order to have longer network lifetime. Upon detection of an event, the proposed scheme aims to route the event samples through an energy efficient and stable path from source node to the sink node. On performance evaluation, we found that our proposed scheme outperforms in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and stability of selected gateway nodes than considered competitive approaches. © 2016 IEEE.","clustering; Cognitive radio sensor networks; energy consumption; routing protocol","Cognitive radio; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based routing; clustering; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Distributed clustering; Distributed events; Opportunistic spectrum access; Packet delivery ratio; Research challenges; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Considering the application domain where video frames from an array of video sensors are co-related we exploit this inter frame co-relation by taking the partial wavelet transform between the frames followed by identifying the difference of wavelet of these frames. The scheme works in accordance with a tree based routing scheme for randomly placed node with an aim to reduce energy consumption further.

In WSN data sending directly to the sink node can raise various problems. Information gathering technique is the center of the Wireless Sensor Network. In WNS data is gathered by sensor nodes and these gathered data is sent to the base station (BS). This is the basic working of WSN. With the data collection, network lifetime is also the major principle for design of data aggregation technique in sensor network. Most of the energy of the remote sensor network is utilized for data sending. Data aggregation is performed to avoid such problems related to energy. Cluster as well as tree structures are utilized to preform data aggregation in present systems. We propose an energy-effective system in which data collection nodes are utilized for gathering data from cluster head inside the cluster. The lifetime of the wireless network is improved by forwarding the data in aggregated format. In last papers if the cluster head or cluster member is malicious the false data injector was unable to detect it. In this paper, we propose a system to overcome the cons on the previous papers i.e. to find the attacked node as well as cluster head.

These sensor networks are responsible to sense, computation and transmission. In certain conditions sensor node cannot able to communicate with its neighbor nodes and may turn to 'dumb node'. In such situations it can sense its environment but is unable to communicate. Due to this the nodes cannot able to communicate with its nearest nodes. This is because of contraction in communication range which happens due to the detriment environmental effects. However communicating with other nodes gets break up. Thus it is necessary to identify dumb nodes and replace the dumb nodes for effective communication. By placing minimum number of relay nodes the problem of dumb nodes can be solved. In the proposed work a probable solution for detection of dumb nodes in an efficient way and to replace those dumb nodes by relay nodes is suggested.

When building wireless sensor networks network there is critical issues are emerged such as preserving energy and load balancing. Lifetime of a sensor network is enhanced by implementing and mitigating energy consumption. Number of various parameters such as number of nodes, strength and range of area as well as connectivity of nodes in the network are responsible for the lifetime of network. Energy of battery is most important things for sensor nodes in wireless sensor network. Efficient energy is major part of in mitigate the overhead as well as limited transmission and aggregating data is also important for the enhancing network lifetime. We proposed a clustering routing protocol CRT2FLACO on the basis of type-2 fuzzy logic as well as ACO for balancing the network load and to enhance the lifetime of WSN. Our proposed protocol determines the three fundamental parts of residual energy, neighbor nodes as well as the distance to base station as inputs of a type-2 Mamdani FLS and after that calculate the possibility of a node upgrading as a candidate cluster head and the cluster head competition radius. Implementation of type-2 fuzzy logic is better way to control the overhead existing in WSN. Load of network is efficiently handled by fuzzy unequal competition radius as well as implementation of multi-hop routing protocol technique for data transmission. Additionally, security of data is determined by utilizing encryption algorithm in transmission of data.

This project presents the clustering approach which includes the Wireless sensor network. In the clustering approaches share the loads with cluster head nodes. To extend the cluster head's life and extend the life time of network based on the distance between the cluster head and base station. Energy usage is minimized by exploiting density estimation, sleeping modes and duty cycle control and distance between the cluster head and nodes. In this work, we proposed clustering mechanism. Nodes associate with the nearby CH. Nodes are classified in to critical nodes and non-critical nodes. Critical nodes are continuously transmission between the CH and nodes. so energy usage of critical node is high at the same time non-critical node based on the open loop system. It is not continiously transmit, so minimized energy usage of non-critical nodes. The proposed mechanism will effectively reduce the frequency of the transmission of the sensor nodes more close to sink and achieve the effectiveness of saving power and extending the lifetime of network. © 2016 IEEE.","cluster head; clustering approach; critical nodes; non-critical nodes","Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks; Changing environment; Cluster head; Clustering approach; Clustering mechanism; Critical node; Density estimation; Industrial automation; Lifetime of networks; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

WSN composes of large number of sensor nodes, which are tiny, low powered, densely deployed in an ad hoc fashion either inside a physical phenomenon to be sensed or very closely to it. The region around the sink forms a bottleneck zone due to heavy traffic flow, which reduces the lifetime of WSN. One of the constraints in the WSNs is limited battery power of the sensor nodes which in turn can reduce the lifetime of WSN. This paper attempts to improve the network lifetime by considering duty cycle, network coding and clustering techniques.

Wireless Sensor Network consists of a large number of heterogeneous or homogeneous sensor nodes which communicates through wireless medium and works together to sense or monitor the environment. The number of sensor nodes in a network can vary from hundreds to thousands. The node senses data from environment and sends these data to the gateway node. Mostly WSNs are used for applications such as military surveillance and disaster monitoring. WSNs are multi-hop networks, which depend on the intermediate nodes to relay the data packet to the destination. These nodes are equipped with lesser memory, limited battery power, little computation capability, small range of communication and need a secured and efficient routing path to forward the incoming packet delay by data aggregation) and multipath sensor networks to increase the resilience and reliability of the network. The localization information is crucial for the operation of WSN. There are mainly two types of Localization algorithms. The Range-based localization algorithm has requirements on hardware, thus is expensive to be implemented in practice. The Range-free localization algorithm reduces the hardware cost. In this paper we locate known nodes by placement (DV Hop) in various locations for best result. Our algorithm improves the localization accuracy compared with previous algorithms, which has been demonstrated by the simulating results.","Beacon nodes; Localization; MDV-hop; WSN","Gateways (computer networks); Hardware; Military applications; Sensor nodes; Beacon nodes; Localization; Localization accuracy; Localization algorithm; Localization information; MDV-hop; Range free localization; Range-based localization algorithms; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

Existing literature on k - coverage does not consider residual energy levels and actual battery discharge rate of ACTIVE nodes. OBSP (Optimized Backoff Sleep Protocol) considers the residual energy level information and battery discharge rate but ignores the k-coverage degree. This paper proposes k-CGP (k-Coverage Guarantee Protocol) based on battery discharge curve using polynomial regression for different coverage degrees (k). k-CGP determines the optimal wakeup rate of sleeping nodes by computing Optimal Sleep Time derived from battery discharge curve using polynomial regression and Received Signal Strength Indicator for distance estimation. The coverage redundancy is computed by using equi-distance test. Due to this, a sufficient number of ACTIVE nodes could be maintained while achieving lesser energy consumption in the network. Simulation results show that k-CGP achieves higher energy savings and sensing area coverage as compared to PEAS. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery discharge rate; Coverage degree; Coverage redundancy; Energy efficiency; Optimal duty cycle; Regression analysis","Electric batteries; Electronic equipment; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Redundancy; Regression analysis; Sensor nodes; Sleep research; Thermoelectric equipment; Battery discharge; Battery discharge curves; Coverage degree; Distance estimation; Distributed sensor networks; Duty-cycle; Polynomial regression; Received signal strength indicators; Wireless sensor networks","More, A.; Mukesh Patel School of Technology, Management and Engineering, NMIMS UniversityIndia; email: avinash.more@nmims.edu",,"IEEE Computer Society",21592047,9781509053063,,,"English","Int.

The sensor nodes collect the information through neighboring nodes to particular node. The data collection and processing is done by data aggregation techniques. For the data aggregation in sensor network, clustering technique is implemented in the sensor network by implementing self organizing feature map (SOFM) neural network. Some of the sensor nodes are selected as cluster head nodes. The information aggregated to cluster head nodes from non cluster head nodes and then this information is transferred to base station (or sink nodes).

It leads to the fact that the nearest sensor nodes fail much earlier than remote ones, In the long run, traffic from all the sensor nodes is going through one sensor node that is nearest to sink and the former disrupt the work of the rest of WSN. From the point of view of energy saving, big WSNs with only one sink cannot consume resources effectively. To solve this problem it is necessary to divide the WSN into clusters.

In WSN, nodes have limited power and low processing capacity. Moreover, a homogeneous sensor network comprises of nodes having similar behavior. These constraints make it difficult to identify compromised nodes in such a network. Compromised nodes are those nodes whose behavior are dissimilar from normal nodes. Compromised node can be harmful for the network. To solve the problem of finding compromised node we are using anomaly detection technique. In this technique the behavior of nodes is observed and checked whether it is normal or not. We select some Intrusion Detection System(IDS) agents on the basis of internal congestion within the node. IDS agent are trained to analyze the behavior of the nodes and are able to check the deviation in the behavior of the nodes. We provide a matrix to IDS agent, which is stored in their buffer. This matrix consist of parameters which are related to the behavior of the node. Input value of the matrix is 0 or 1, if the matrix result is 1 then the behavior of the node is abnormal(deviation from normal). The IDS agents send the unique identifier of the compromised node to the Base Station. Base Station will finally check how many messages a node can send to Base Station. If the number is greater than the maximum message limit then the node is considered to be compromised node. The algorithm which is proposed in this paper can be efficient for the small networks. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Base stations; Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Matrix algebra; Mercury (metal); Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Anomaly detection; Compromised nodes; Input values; Intrusion Detection Systems; Processing capacities; Recent researches; Small networks; Unique identifiers; Sensor nodes",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Wireless sensor networks have verities of applications including endangered animals monitoring, military applications like tracking positions of soldiers. Important points to be considered in this application are to secure the location of monitored objects. In presence of object sensor nodes sends event reporting messages periodically. Attackers can back track those messages to reach at source to capture the object. Different kind of techniques have been developed to protect the object from adversary like 'Phantom routing', Cyclic entrapping method (CEM) and Path extension method (PEM) which provides source location privacy in some extend but not provides 100 percent safety to the source. In this Paper a new method called Bypassing using Directional Transceivers (BDT) is introduced which performs well in case of safety, energy consumption and throughput analysis. Within a sensor network instead of using single transceiver in this new method four directional transceivers are used to provide better safety.

These tasks may consist of very complex functions and large calculations. In order to make network alive for a long duration, these sensors have to take decision in judicious and efficient manner. The increased lifetime results into increased connectivity. Also, the intellectual use of energy resources provides the nodes better connectivity to the base station. The different clustering protocols such as Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) are used in order to gain energy efficiency. The LEACH uses probability as the key attribute to elect the new cluster head. In this paper, a new approach based on the frequency of a node selected as cluster head for the selection of new cluster head is proposed which is also more efficient than the former one. The proposed approach for cluster head selection results in increased lifetime and thus, in increased connectivity.

One of the ways of doing it is by using a global positioning system (GPS). However, systems based on GPS consume larger amount of power and may fail in covered regions. Moreover changing batteries frequently is also a problem. In this paper we have discussed the design and implementation of an energy-efficient cross-layered protocol stack for an application of wireless sensor networks aimed at tracking the co-ordinates of a mobile entity for habitat monitoring. We have implemented this on TelosB motes using TinyOS. This paper focuses on development of protocols pertaining to three layers of the stack viz. physical layer, MAC layer and application layer. The protocols implemented include variants of timing-sync protocol for sensor networks, weighted centroid localization and sensor medium access control (SMAC). Our SMAC variant forms the basic framework upon which the localization and time synchronization algorithms are implemented in the data period and synchronization period, respectively. The results of the designed protocols are significant and demonstrate the potential of the performance of the protocol stack. © 2016 IEEE.","cross layered protocol stack; habitat monitoring; SMAC; TelosB motes; TinyOS; TPSN; WCL; Wireless sensor networks","Access control; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Global positioning system; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Network layers; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Habitat monitoring; Protocol stack; SMAC; TelosB motes; TinyOS; TPSN; Wireless sensor networks",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

There are different routing protocols exist for find the efficient route to transmits the data from source to destination. The performance of the routing protocols depends of the various factors in the network like packets size, types of signals, movement of nodes (mobility model), data transmission rate, power consuming rate and types of topologies or network architecture. The consuming of battery power is the serious issue for the performance of routing protocols in the network, in term of lifetime of the network and packets delivery ratio as well. Initially, that is considered different routing protocols with different topologies and also considered mobility model like Random way point mobility and group based mobility for the analysis then evaluate the performance. Mobility model highly impact on the performance of routing protocols and lifetime of the network because movement of the nodes consumed more energy than stationary nodes. That routing protocol namely as AODV routing protocol performed without relay point architecture. In this paper, evaluate the performance of AODV protocol with star topology using different mobility models. Performance analysis and evaluation has been done on the different metrics like jitter, throughput, packets dropped, End to End delay, energy consumption in different processing modes and percentage of time consumed in different processing modes.

Today's recently grown in technology, the need for underwater communication has become more pronounced. But the UWSN communications are characterized by limited battery energy because each node plays the role of an individual router. Therefore, it is very essential to use energy properly and effectively in underwater networks. Through this research we have studied various parameters of UWSN and learnt a lot about this topic.

In an UWASN, passive node mobility is inevitable. Therefore, the performance analysis of UWASNs renders meaningful insights with the inclusion of a mobility model, which represents realistic oceanic scenarios. In this regard, the existing works on performance analysis of UWASNs lack the consideration of major dominating forces, which offer impetus for a node's mobility. Additionally, the existing works are limited to only shallow depths and coastal areas. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a physical mobility model, named Oceanic Forces Mobility Model, by incorporating important realistic oceanic forces imparted on nodes. The proposed model considers the effects of node mobility in 3-D space of water. We also present an analysis on the impact of node mobility on the performance of UWASNs in terms of network dispersion and localization. Simulation results indicate performance degradation of UWASNs in the presence of oceanic forces—localization coverage decreases by 36.70%, localization error increases nearly by 21.14%, and average energy consumption increases by 3% approximately.

A dumb node can sense its surroundings, but is unable to transmit these sensed data to any other node, due to the sudden onset of adverse environmental effects. However, such a node resumes its normal operations with the resumption of favorable environmental conditions. Due to the presence of dumb nodes, the network is unable to provide the expected services. Therefore, it is prudent to re-establish connectivity between dumb and other nodes, so that sensed data can be reliably transmitted to the sink. Before the re-establishment of connectivity, a node needs to confirm its actual state of being dumb. Dumb behavior is dynamic in nature, and is, thus, distinct from the traditional node isolation problem considered in stationary WSNs. Therefore, the existing schemes for the detection of other misbehaviors are not applicable for detecting a dumb node in a WSN. Considering this temporal behavior of a dumb node, we propose an approach, D3, for the detection of dumb nodes. In the propose scheme, we uses cumulative sum test, which helps in detecting the dumb behavior. The simulation results show that there is 56% degradation in detection percentage with the increment in the detection threshold, whereas energy consumption and the message overhead increase by 40% with the increment in detection threshold.

Hence in this paper an efficient algorithm which maintains maximum coverage along with balance of load on the nodes is achieved by forming the cover tree connecting the maximum area along all its traces where the path discovered and it discovers a single best route from source node to the destination node rather than choosing the best route among all the discovered routes like in the previous approaches. The best single route is discovered based on forward probability of choosing the next node which is a function of energy of the next node and Euclidean distance from current node to next node. The proposed algorithm finds the neighbor nodes. If neighbor nodes has destination it stops the process otherwise find the forward node based on maximum probable coverage and high energy. The process is repeated until destination is reached. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of route discovery time, number of hops, number of alive and dead nodes, residual energy, end to end delay and residual energy. © 2016 IEEE.","Coverage; Dn (destination node); MCLCT (maximum connected load balancing cover tree); Nodes; OCCH (optimised connected coverage heuristic); SN (source node); WSN (wireless sensor network)","Forestry; Mobile telecommunication systems; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Connected loads; Coverage; Destination nodes; Nodes; OCCH (optimised connected coverage heuristic); Source nodes; WSN (wireless sensor network); Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Wireless sensor systems are outfitted with minor, essential batteries and along these lines it is important to plan vitality effective calculations to draw out the system lifetime. In remote sensor systems (WSNs), the sink versatility along an obliged mode can enhance the vitality proficiency. Sink mobility is an imperative method to enhance sensor system execution including vitality utilization, end-To-end delay and lifetime. To manage the above issues researches introduced a Rendezvous design technique, where some sensor nodes are selected as an RP's and the nodes which are not RP's will forward data to the nearest RP's. The major issue in this design is to find the set of RP's and determine the tour that visits these RP's. To overcome this issue in this paper we proposed an algorithm called as an "" Weighted Rendezvous Planning(WRP)"" , where each node is provided with some weight based on the number of packets that it sends and the nearest hop distance.

The redundant data collection in dense network results in more energy consumption. The Data Routing In-Network Aggregation (DRINA) is one of the recent algorithm proposed to reduce energy consumption in dense network environment by minimizing the number of communications from source to sink. Here the Data transmission is carried out by using data aggregation in cluster based environment using shortest path method. But due to inefficient cluster head selection technique, it is unable to mange cluster head failures and evades the energy drain in sensor nodes along the common static path that leads network partition. In order to overcome these problems we proposed an algorithm known as Energy Efficient Routing using Dynamic Cluster approach (EBDRA), that includes efficient cluster head selection technique and dynamic route selection for the reliable data transmission. In our approach the cluster head selection technique involves an efficient method of cluster head selection.

This proposed work involves construction of a tree structure with random placement of nodes and a BFS algorithm is implemented for aggregated converge cast, which allots minimum time slots to the nodes, a local time slot algorithm is implemented for raw data convergecast, which allots parallel time slots to the nodes to allow simultaneous transmissions. This praposed method attains the less schedule length by using the balanced tree structures. Initially constructed a tree structure with random placement of nodes and applied BFS algorithm for that tree structure. In BFS algorithm, 5 timeslots are required for 10 nodes to send data packets to sink node.

Entire network lifetime is depending on efficient energy consumption in sensor network. Clustering is one of the techniques to utilize the energy of network efficiently. This method consumes extra communication overhead in exchanging messes for selecting appropriate cluster head. This type of transmission of message from node to node consumes extra energy that makes energy resources inefficient. This paper provides an approach to prolong the WSN lifetime using fuzzy logic based selection of cluster head that provides completely non probabilistic approach. This approach uses two fuzzy variables: Base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. In this approach multi-hop communication is used. One cluster Head (CH) has the authority to communicate with the other CH and also with the BS. Simulation result verifies the proposed approach in prolonging the WSNs network lifetime. © 2016 IEEE.","Cluster head; Fuzzy logic; Non-probabilistic approach; Wireless sensor network(WSN)","Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer circuits; Disaster prevention; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Military applications; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Preventive maintenance; Sensor nodes; Cluster head; Communication overheads; Disaster relief operations; Energy efficient; Multi hop communication; Network lifetime; Non-probabilistic; Residual energy; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Routing is the area where energy of the nodes can be conserved to prolong the lifetime of the WSN network. There exist some routing protocols, out of which clustering protocols has proven energy efficient because network is divided into multiple clusters and the leader of the cluster will supervise thedata routing to the base station/sink after removing redundant data. In this paper we have used hybrid approach for creating the clusters and for forwarding the data to base station. The Cluster Heads(CHs) for first two rounds will be elected by base-station using centralized algorithm and from third round, CHs are selected by the previous cluster heads using distributed algorithm. We introduce a mobile IGN (Integrated Gateway Node) which acts as an interface between CHs and base station. The data transmission from the sensor nodes to the CH will takes place using proactive algorithm and the data transmission between mobile node and base station uses reactive algorithm. Base-station divides the CHs into sectors and assigns mobile node to each sector with the predefined path to relay the data to it. The mobile nodes which is having unlimited energy resources in this architecture is used to conserve energy and prolong life time of the network compared to other routing protocols. © 2016 IEEE.","Base station; Cluster head; Integrated gateway node; LEACH","Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Gateways (computer networks); Internet protocols; Leaching; Network architecture; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Centralized algorithms; Cluster head; Clustering protocol; Energy efficient; Energy-constrained; Integrated gateways; Multiple clusters; Reactive algorithms; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

By using clustering approach, the energy consumption of nodes in the network can be decreased thereby increasing its lifetime. In various multi-hop cluster-based routing protocols, nodes nearer to the Base Station (BS) exhaust their energy quickly than other nodes as data from the entire network is forwarded to BS through them. Due to this, nearby nodes die sooner and network get partitioned. This is known as hot spot problem. This paper proposes a load balanced and energy efficient data collection scheme using data mule for larger network area. The proposed protocol is based on the centralized approach which uses fixed clustering. In this protocol, the BS divides the whole network into fixed rectangular shaped clusters of unequal size. The size of the cluster is dependent on its distance from the central vertical path of the data mule. To overcome from more energy loss at the clusters nearer to this vertical path due to more data handling, proposed protocol introduces unequal size grid clustering approach. It also ensures that the transmission distance for any communication in the network is less than the threshold distance of the energy consumption model. It also increases load balancing in terms of energy consumption and data traffic. It can provide better solution to hot spot problem and hence can improve network lifetime with respect to other existing routing protocols. © 2016 IEEE.","Anchor point (AP); Base Station (BS); Cluster Head (CH); Cluster Member (CM); Data Mule; Grid; Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Base stations; Data acquisition; Data handling; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Anchor point; Cluster head; Cluster Member (CM); Data mules; Grid; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The current paper focuses on the digital implementation details on the Lightning Sensor Node. The data acquisition and processing is carried out on the Kintex-7 FPGA. The setup comprises of a cRIO-9030 chassis along with the I/O modules mounted on it and a Kintex-7 FPGA. The various data acquisition steps and the processing algorithm have been implemented on the Kintex-7 FPGA. The cRio-9030 controller is only used for handling the communication from the Controller to the PC using Ethernet. The data acquisition basically comprises of sampling using ADC at the rate of 1 MS/s using NI 9223 ADC module and GPS time stamping for relevant sample value acquired using the ADC module. The NI 9467 module is used for the GPS time stamping purpose. The sampling at such a high rate results in a lot of unwanted data being buffered and tends to increase the processing overhead. Hence, we have further implemented a smart triggering on the FPGA. The FPGA now sends a limited chunk of data in the form of a frame consisting of 35 data points along with the relevant timestamps in microseconds. The data obtained after applying the Smart Triggering algorithm is now dispatched to the cRIO controller using the FPGA to Real Time DMA FIFO.

Commonly used protocols like ADOV, DSR, and so forth in MANET are not designed to tackle black hole attack or black hole affected routes. Hence this paper proposes an AODV-based secure routing mechanism to detect and eliminate black hole attack and affected routes in the early phase of route discovery. A validity value is attached with RREP which ensures that there is no attack along the path. The proposed method is simulated in NS2 and performance analysis is carried out. © 2016 IEEE.","AODV; Black hole attack; Mobile ad hoc network; Route reply; Validity value","Ad hoc networks; Gravitation; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Stars; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; AODV; Black hole attack; Blackhole attacks; Centralized administration; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Performance analysis; Route reply; Validity value; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Although most number of proposals have come through to validate its parameters still there are small issues which pose a large threat to the performance criterion of WSN, one among is the hand over which is least addressed in all types of advancements and still poses a problem for the sensor-nodes with not enough computation capability, restricted power and less memory size. In the handoff procedure the mobiles user fluctuates from one area to another area of coverage when the call duration is still enabled, under such scenarios since his motion shifts from one station to other the signal gets deteriorated and connectivity to the next system creates a delay due to which handover is caused.

The nonappearance of a trusted outsider suggests that current WSN trust administration plans are not appropriate to UWSNs. In this approach, we propose a trust administration plan for UWSNs to give effective and vigorous trust information stockpiling and trust era. For trust information stockpiling, we utilize a geographic hash table to distinguish stockpiling hubs and to altogether lessening stockpiling cost. We utilize subjective rationale based agreement strategies to moderate trust variances brought about by ecological variables. We abuse an arrangement of trust similitude capacities to identify trust exceptions and to support trust contamination assaults. We illustrate, through broad investigations and reproductions, that the proposed plan is effective, powerful and versatile. In this Project we have to form a Wireless Sensor Network with different set of nodes in it. Each node has a capacity to travel from one place to another, if any node wants to make a communication with another node, it has to make a request to the recipient node to identify whether that node is able to receive or not, once the recipient acknowledges for the request connection is established between source and destination. In between it also checks if any of the nodes are unattended in the scenario which means that it acts like a malicious node and that should be eliminated while transactions. For all the above demonstrations we have to follow the classification algorithm called Bayesian and maintain the Hash table logic to provide successful data transmission between source and destination. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed services; Logical data flow; Trust management scheme; Unattended WSN","Data structures; Data transfer; Sensor nodes; Unattended sensors; Classification algorithm; Distributed service; Ecological variables; Geographic hash-tables; Logical data; Trust management; Unattended wireless sensor networks; Unattended WSN; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Biomedical wireless sensor network (BWSN) plays a vital role in this connection because it can be attached to the patient without causing any inconvenience to him/her and can communicate to any remote healthcare office without any delay. BWSN consists of individual nodes to collect the patient's information and communicate it to the remote health centre if the value of sensed signal is beyond normal range. The nodes deployed within the patients form a BWSN, and the network has to send the information from the source to the remote sink in an efficient way. The network should choose an optimized path for this communication, so that the node’s lifetime is increased. This paper presents a Q-learning-algorithm-based routing concept to route the sensed information if required from the individual node to the remote healthcare station. Simulations are made with a set of mobile biomedical wireless sensor nodes within an area of 100 m × 100 m flat space operating for 600 seconds of simulation time.

Earlier works did not concentrate on both fault management and loss recovery issues. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a reliable data aggregation scheme is proposed that uses support vector machine (SVM) for performing failure detection and loss recovery. Initially, a group head, selected based on node connectivity, splits the nodes into clusters based on their location information. In each cluster, the cluster member with maximum node connectivity is chosen as the cluster head. When the aggregator receives data from the source, it identifies node failures in the received data by classifying the faulty data using SVM. Furthermore, a reserve node-based fault recovery mechanism is developed to prevent data loss. Through simulations, we show that the proposed technique minimises the transmission overhead and increases reliability. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Data aggregation; sensor nodes; support vector machine; wireless sensor network","Classification (of information); Computer system recovery; Recovery; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Data aggregation; Failure detection; Fault management; Faultrecovery mechanisms; Location information; Node connectivity; Reliable data aggregation; Transmission overheads; Sensor nodes","Kamalesh, S.; Information Technology, Anna UniversityIndia; email: skl@vcet.ac.in",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",0952813X,,,,"English","J.

This study focuses on misbehaviors arising due to the presence of\enskip ""dumb"" nodes [Misra et al. 2014; Roy et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Kar and Misra 2015], which can sense its surroundings but cannot communicate with its neighbors due to shrinkage in its communication range by the environmental effects attributed to change in temperature, rainfall, and fog. However, a dumb node is expected to behave normally on the onset of favorable environmental conditions. Therefore, the presence of such dumb nodes in the network gives rise to impaired connectivity between a subset of nodes and, consequently, results in change in topology. Such phenomena are dynamic in nature and are thus distinct from the phenomena attributed to traditional isolation problems considered in stationary WSNs. Activation of all the sensor nodes simultaneously is not necessarily energy efficient and cost-effective. In order to maintain self-adaptivity of the network, two algorithms, named Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes (CoRD) and Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes Without Applying Constraints (CoRDWAC), are designed. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated through simulation-based experiments. Further, it is also observed that the performance of CoRD is better than the existing topology control protocols-LETC and A1-with respect to the number of nodes activated, overhead, and energy consumption. © 2017 ACM.","Connectivity; Dumb node; Dynamic shrinkage; Self-adaptivity; Wireless sensor network","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Shrinkage; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; Communication range; Connectivity; Dumb node; Dynamic shrinkage; Environmental conditions; Self adaptivity; Topology control protocols; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15564665,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

Multi-hop data forwarding from sensor nodes to the base station reduces energy consumption of individual sensor nodes but generates hot-spot problem. In this work, we propose a multi-hop relay based energy saving network management scheme with mobile sink in WSN named MESNET which reduces energy consumption and extend the network lifetime while maintaining a pre-bound delay between a sensor node and its associated cluster head (CH). In the setup phase, an efficient generation of cluster heads (EGENC) algorithm runs to find a subset of deployed sensor nodes as CHs. CHs are selected based on the residual energy and the energy consumed in the last round data communication of sensor nodes. Number of relay hops between a cluster member node and the CH is restricted to balance the network load. For further balancing the network load, we use an upper limit on number of member nodes of a CH. Efficient selection of the CHs reduces the path length of the mobile sink. Simulation results depict superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to existing work with respect to energy consumption, network lifetime and delay. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Clustering; Mobile sink; Multi-hop relay; Wireless sensor network","Artificial intelligence; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Network management; Sensor nodes; Clustering; Data-communication; Hot spot problem; Mobile sinks; Multi-hop relay; Network lifetime; Residual energy; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Chowdhury, S.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, ShibpurIndia; email: src.dcs.dcs@gmail.com","Mandal J.K.Mukhopadhyay S.Dutta P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811064265,,,"English","Commun.

Therefore, time synchronization is very important aspect in wireless sensor networks. Time synchronization assures that all the sensor nodes in wireless sensor network have the same clock time. There are various applications where secure time synchronization in wireless sensor networks is required. Secure time synchronization in wireless sensor networks require time message confidentiality, integrity and authentication. Wireless sensor networks suffer from various attacks such as data integrity attack, man-in-middle, replay attack, etc. Most of the existing time synchronization techniques are not designed with security provisions. This paper proposes security solution for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks with the objective to ensure message integrity and message authentication in an energy efficient manner. Simulation results exhibit that proposed scheme is suitable to ensure security for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks in an energy efficient manner. Results: The performance of proposed algorithms Secure Time Synchronization (STS) and Clustered Time Synchronization without security (CTS) have been evaluated, and then compared with Timing sync protocols for sensor networks (TPSN) and Two-hop time synchronization (TTS). The performance evaluation includes message complexity and energy consumption. Conclusion: It is mandatory to identify the security requirements of the applications. There are various applications where energy is mandatory requirement as compared to security. However, there are some applications such as health and military where security is crucial factor as compared to energy consumption. It is very important to consider the capacity of the nodes (processor, memory and energy) while developing the secure time synchronization protocols. In critical applications time synchronization is very important to know the exact time of the event. The proposed Secure Time Synchronization (STS) scheme uses two symmetric keys and hash function to ensure the synchronization of the nodes with security of the message travelling in wireless channel. The objective of STS is to avoid replay attack, integrity attack and man-in-middle attack and ensure synchronization with better precision. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm save the energy along with security features as compared to other non-secure synchronization protocols. This enhance the network lifetime. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","Attacks on nodes; Processor; Security; Sensor nodes; Time synchronization; WSN",,"Gautam, G.C.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: gopalcgautam@gmail.com",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",22103279,,,,"English","Int.

A replay attack is carried out by continuously keeping track of the messages exchanged between entities and replayed later to either bring down the target entity or affect the performance of the target network. Many mechanisms have been designed to mitigate the replay attack in WSN, but most of the mechanisms are either complex or insecure. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to mitigate the replay attack in WSN. In the proposed work at each node, assorted value of a received packet is maintained in a table and the reply attack is detected or mitigated using their assorted value of the already received packets.

The idea evolves as a reduction in duty cycle and precise time scheduling of active/sleep cycles of the sensors to reduce the probability of collisions between data and control packets which prolongs the network lifetime and reduces the average end to end delay. The multihop transmissions are not always attractive in underwater communication due to high losses. The proposed Slotted Cyclic Quorum with Influence nodes (SCQI) medium access control protocol is capable of continuous monitoring of critical underwater events in a very effective manner in multihop transmission networks. This work is an attempt to mitigate multihop hidden terminal and to reduce the probability of collisions between data and control packets. Methods: The mathematical model for the path loss due to attenuation of electromagnetic wave propagation in the sea water is explained. The three path reflection model evaluating reflection loss from the air-water and water-sand interfaces as a function of distance between sensors and water depth is introduced. It is assumed that the sensors are properly anchored to limit their movement due to waves within the permissible limits to follow the proposed cyclic quorum based medium access control protocol. The fundamentals of cyclic quorum with a slotted scheme along with the influence nodes are elaborated. This paper attempts to utilize electromagnetic waves at resonance frequency of 2.4 GHz for underwater communication. The main advantages of using electromagnetic waves instead of acoustic waves are that it reduces the latency due to faster propagation speed and give a high data rate due to high frequency of the wave at the cost of reduction in communication range. Results: The results verify that the implementation of cyclic quorum based medium access control (CQ) protocol, slotted cyclic quorum based medium access control (SCQ) protocol and slotted cyclic quorum based medium access control with influence nodes (SCQI) protocol has significantly reduced the average end to end delay with the increase in number of sensor nodes and also prolongs the network lifetime making it appropriate for critical and real time data monitoring. Conclusion: This work proves the suitability of electromagnetic waves as an effective alternative for underwater wireless communication. The main objective is to optimize the network lifetime and to reduce the average end to end delay by implementing cyclic quorum based medium access control protocol in underwater wireless sensor networks and to draw the attention of researchers in this area. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","2.4 GHz; Collisions; Influence nodes; Multihop hidden terminal; Slotted cyclic quorum; Underwater electromagnetic wave communication; Underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN)","Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustics; Air; Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Electromagnetic waves; Internet protocols; Monitoring; Phase interfaces; Seawater; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; 2.4 ghz; Collisions; Hidden terminal; Influence nodes; Slotted cyclic quorum; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Medium access control","Raina, V.; ECE, CET, Mody University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: vikasraina.raina04@gmail.com",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",22132759,,,,"English","Recent Pat.

Sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station. In recent years, such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas. Generally, sensor nodes are small, cost-effective, memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment. Energy is one of the significant factors in such network. Whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place. Sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster. The purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way. A cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station. An efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption, thereby increasing network lifetime. One major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round, cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region. This process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head. Transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource. In this paper, a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the WSNs lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed. In this, whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (GH) using two fuzzy variables, viz., base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. This approach uses a multi-hop communication approach. GH nodes are authorized to communicate with other GH nodes and base station. Simulation results show that the proposed approach prolongs WSNs network lifetime than existing ones. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Fuzzy logic; Grid head; Non-probabilistic; Wireless sensor networks","Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head selections; Consumption of energy; Environmental conditions; Grid head; Multi hop communication; Non-probabilistic; Processing capability; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Kumar, V.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of TechnologyIndia; email: vimalmnnit16@gmail.com","Sahana S.K.Saha S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811025242,,,"English","Adv.

As direct transmissions are costly, multi-hop approach is often used to collect the data of the nodes at the sink. However, many-to-one communication pattern in multi-hop communication may result in an unbalanced energy consumption in the network. Nodes closer to the sink deplete their energy at a faster rate than nodes that are further away. Mixed transmission approach, where each node trades-off between the cheaper hop-by-hop transmission and costlier direct transmission, is a good solution for balancing energy consumption. This paper proposes a receiver contention based mixed transmission scheme for energy balancing. In addition to distance and residual energy of the receivers, it also considers the link reliability and the number of neighboring nodes, in setting of the timer that will determine the relay node selection. The proposed approach gives more efficient and effective energy balanced data transmission as compared with the other works proposed in the literature. Its performance is evaluated and presented both analytically and through simulations, and the analytical estimations are validated by the simulation results. The simulation results show a significant improvement over the other closely related approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily used with both uniform as well as non-uniform node deployment. © 2016","Energy balanced data transmission; Energy-efficiency; Mixed hop transmission schemes; Routing; Wireless sensor network","Channel capacity; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy balance; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Transmissions; Wireless sensor networks; Analytical estimations; Balancing energy consumption; Energy-balanced; Hop-by-hop transmission; Many-to-one communications; Multi hop communication; Routing; Transmission schemes; Energy efficiency","Kulshrestha, J.; Department of Computer Engineering and Applications, GLA UniversityIndia; email: jagrati.kulshrestha@gla.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994407046

One of the major investigation in the consideration of MWSNs sustains from the problem of system throughput and end-to-end delay along with the issue of energy consumption. This idle illustrates a X-layer network (cross-layer network) transformation model that can decline the problem of energy consumption and along with end-to-end delay in these networks. In this paper, the moderate model restrains four layers in the network transformation: (a) application layer, which has been utilized to update the node locality and information; (b) network layer, which has been accomplished to recognize the routing of the internetwork through links; (c) MAC (medium access control) layer, which has been centralized on the effectiveness of the networks, and (d) physical layer has also been recommended keeping the intentional view on transmission power from sensor node to the sink node. The place/location and position/status of the mobile node is interlinked in the routing transformation immediately as soon as the route finding process is successfully terminated and then it is been employed by controlling the transmission power of the MAC layer to rectify the range of the transmission with respect to the route. As per the future expectations of practical characteristics is concerned, adjacent NB(neighbor) list discovery broadcast will be engaged only for active nodes. But this paper is accomplished an modern technique, i.e., mobility aware protocol, which recognizes the mobility (velocity/speed) of the nodes so that only those respective nodes will be upgraded with its adjacent NB-list broadcasting, resulting in minimum power utilized by the network interface and also in the degradation of the energy consumption of the node’s. In spite of the above concern, one more additional cause approaching in this model is the issue of bottleneck problem, which has been established due to multiple sources resulting in huge packet loss. This issue has been solved by pipe-lining those packets of the sensor which are nearer to the sink node, which results in reduction of end-to-end delay and energy utilization resulting in high system throughput. Through NS-II simulation, the results of energy consumption, system throughput, end-to-end delay, etc., has been shown. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","End-to-end delay; Energy efficiency; IEEE 802.15.4 protocol; Mobile WSNs; System throughput; X-layer network transformation model","Access control; Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent computing; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Packet networks; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Standards; Throughput; Wireless sensor networks; End to end delay; IEEE 802.15.4; Layer networks; Mobile WSNs; System throughput; Network layers","Mohiddin, M.K.; Department of ECE, GITAM UniversityIndia; email: khwaja7388@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

To attain this goal, need to minimize total energy consumption and balanced the node in the network. Many researches proposes different protocols like LEACH, HEED, PEGASIS, GSTEB. In this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Self Arranged hierarchical Based Energy Balance Routing Protocol (EESHEB), which discusses two cases of data fusion that is each sensor node transmits identical amount of data and different amount of data. For both cases it builds a routing hierarchy using a method where, for each round, Base Station (BS) allocate a root node and broadcasts the selection message to all sensor nodes. Each node selects its parent by considering itself and its neighbor’s information.

In this type of protocols, cluster heads (CH) are chosen among the sensor nodes and then clusters are formed by assigning non-cluster head to the nearest cluster head. Load balancing and the distribution of the cluster heads are the major drawbacks.

This may partition the network into unreachable segments and thus adversely affect network lifetime. The problem is more acute in random and sparsely deployed networks. Therefore, we propose a deployment strategy that, using the least possible nodes, prolongs network lifetime by avoiding energy holes and also ensures full sensing and communication coverage. The scheme handles the energy imbalance by selecting an appropriate set of communication and sensing ranges for each node based on effective load on that node. After adjusting these ranges, nodes are strategically placed at locations where their energy drains uniformly and thus network lifetime is prolonged. The approach is verified analytically and validated through ns-2 based simulation experiments. The results reveal significant improvements over existing schemes. © TÜBİTAK.","Communication range; Network lifetime; Nonuniform deployment; Sensing range; Wireless sensor networks","Sensor nodes; Communication coverage; Communication load; Communication range; Deployment strategy; Lifetime enhancement; Network lifetime; Non-uniform deployments; Sensing ranges; Wireless sensor networks","Sharma, K.P.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kpsharma17vce@gmail.com",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017384545

WSNs need to be provided with efficient security features generally due to their deployment in inaccessible terrain and also communication being in the wireless domain. Therefore the question of providing security to such networks arises but the major constraints are the limited resources present in the sensor nodes. Prior importance is given to the energy parameter as it is the most vital component of the sensor nodes. So the objective of any intrusion detection framework would be to design robust mechanisms capable of handling attacks in energy efficient manner. Intrusion detection is used in WSNs because of their ability to detect unknown attacks and finding means to thwart them for preserving energy. Therefore energy efficient intrusion detection has become a significant research area for researchers. Keeping this in mind, we survey the major topics of energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs. The survey work presents topics such as the fundamentals of intrusion detection techniques, as well as the various energy saving mechanisms used in different architectural models. The earlier achievements in energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs are also summarized and existing problems are discussed. We also give an insight into the possible directions for future work in intrusion detection by highlighting open research areas. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

These sensor nodes are battery operated and it is difficult to recharge them in the field, so inclusion of energy efficiency is must in the protocols of these networks. Clustering is one of the most popular methods to achieve it. In clustering, the network is divided into various clusters and cluster head of every cluster is responsible to transfer the data to central location (base station). This paper introduces a balanced energy routing protocol based on LEACH-C for WSN. Our proposal not only selects the maximum energy node as cluster head but also distributes the load among the various clusters evenly. This balances the energy consumption among various nodes hence increases the lifetime of the network. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol through simulation indicates a significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency as compared to other well-known protocols.

This condenses load balancing in the network. If the cluster heads collaborate with each other and transfer data based on multihop transmission, then the cluster heads nearer to the sink node are burdened with significant relay traffic and deplete energy much faster, which causes a network coverage problem also known as a hot spot problem. To avoid both of the above problems, this paper proposes two protocols: LEACHDistance and LEACHDistance-M. LEACHDistance is proposed for static wireless sensor networks where cluster heads are chosen based on the upper threshold distance, lower threshold distance, and remaining energy. LEACHDistance-M is proposed for mobile wireless sensor networks where the selection of cluster heads is based on the upper threshold distance, lower threshold distance, remaining energy, and least mobility.

The optimal observation probability is obtained for the parameter values of the sensing and communication characteristics of the nodes using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and probabilistic coverage model. The proposed protocol uses a node scheduling technique using Fuzzy Logic to activate the nodes to form the set covers.

In wireless sensor networks, the sensor nodes are usually deployed in geographic locations to keep track of the changes in the environment. Some kind of attacks might occur to the nodes or the data transferred between the nodes. One such kind of attack is the clone attack in which the attacker might physically capture the nodes and replicate it in different locations. In order to detect and prevent the clone attack different approaches are used namely, centralized detection and distributed detection. Various algorithms are used in both these approaches depending upon the network. The distributed approach is one of the most widely used approach to detect the cloned nodes in the network.

We propose a lightweight key agreement scheme (KAS) that achieves these desirable design criteria: supports a decentralized hierarchy of prefixed number of levels (l). Decentralization is necessary for large networks to delegate powers to lower level users and thereby reduce the burden of primal central authority; deterministic KPS implies nodes in our hierarchy has predictable key rings;our scheme is resilient against compromise of (i) any number of lower level users; and (ii) threshold number of same or higher level nodes in hierarchy;our scheme has predictable connectivity throughout the hierarchy which is a linear function of the system parameter n. In fact our subset based scheme is fully connected till depth 2 (root authority at depth 0). non-interactive: that saves bandwidth.

It is obvious that optimising battery power consumption will result in an increased WSN performance. This research work addresses two key factors which influence the energy consumption of a mote. First, analyse the correlation of link quality indicator (LQI) values to the packet delivery ratio (PDR) based on various environmental conditions; Second, an empirical analysis of battery consumption under various RF transmission scenarios, such as listening, transmission, reception, multi-hop mode (receive and transmit), idle mode, etc. The experimental results identified various performance issues which arise due to: deployment and battery discharge characteristics of sensor mote in a multi hop network. Through this work, a novel methodology called as 'sleeping pill' protocol is proposed. The proposed protocol resulted in 4% reduction of energy consumption for transmitting 10,000 packets at-25 dBm transmission power. The same methodology was applied to the multi-hop multipath routing protocol which increased the life time of the network to about 60%.

In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneity-aware Energy-efficient Clustering (HEC) technique which considers two types of heterogeneity – network lifetime and of sensor nodes. Selection of cluster head nodes is done based on the three network lifetime phases: only advanced nodes are allowed to become cluster heads in the initial phase; in the second active phase all nodes are allowed to participate in cluster head selection process with equal probability, and in the last dying out phase, clustering is relaxed by allowing direct transmission. Simulation-based performance analysis of the proposed technique as compared to other relevant techniques shows that HEC achieves longer stable region, improved throughput, and better energy dissipation owing to judicious consumption of additional energy of advanced nodes. On an average, the improvement observed for stability period over LEACH, SEP, FAIR and HEC- with SEP protocols is around 65%, 30%, 15% and 17% respectively. Further, the scalability of proposed technique is tested by varying the field size and number of sensing nodes. The results obtained are found to be quite optimistic. The impact of energy heterogeneity has also been assessed and it is found to improve the stability period though only upto a certain extent. © 2017 KSII.","Clustering; Energy-efficient; Heterogeneity; Phases of network; Stability period; Wireless sensor network","Channel capacity; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-head nodes; Cluster-head selections; Clustering; Energy efficient; Energy Efficient clustering; Heterogeneity; Network stability; Performance analysis; Energy efficiency","Sharma, S.; IKG Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: sukhwinder.sharma@bbsbec.ac.in",,"Korean Society for Internet Information",19767277,,,,"English","KSII Trans.

In the proposed protocol called Cooperative relay-based TBF (CBTF), although every forwarder knows the next hop from the packet header, it does not transmit directly to its designated neighbor. Instead it lowers its transmission power so as to send the packet to some intermediate relay nodes, lying close to the trajectory, which, in turn, transmit concurrently the packet to the next forwarder. This forces cooperative relaying between two adjacent forwarders, which avoid direct communication between them. The paper shows analytically that the proposed relay-based method in CTBF is more energy-efficient than the direct forwarding used in TBF. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Cooperative communication; Energy efficiency; Power management (telecommunication); Relay control systems; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Cooperative relay; Cooperative relaying; Direct communications; Forwarding nodes; Trajectory based forwarding; Trajectory-based; Transmission power; Wireless broadcast; Wireless sensor networks","Saha, D.; Department of ECE, RCC Institute of Information Technology (RCCIIT)India","Mukherjee S.Bhattacharjee A.K.Deyasi A.Debnath P.","CRC Press/Balkema",,9781138029835,,,"English","Comput.

Providing security and tamper resistant hardware to each node is also unrealistic. The compromised nodes can populate network with forged false reports which can cause false alarms and wrong decision making in networks. En-Route filtering is a popular method for filtering false reports in WSNs. Many such filtering techniques have been proposed for filtering false reports based on single sink. In this paper we propose a multi-sink en-route filtering mechanism, which reduces the overall energy consumption of the network. This is achieved by dividing the network into smaller networks and assigning a separate sink to each smaller network. This helps in reducing the hop count of genuine reports, saving lot of energy consumption. The proposed technique also decreases the key-exchange overhead maintaining the same filtering efficiency. The proposed technique also reduces the effect of selective forwarding attack in the network. The simulated results also support our claims and we are able to save up to 40% of energy consumption. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,"Decision making; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; En-route filtering; Filtering efficiency; Filtering technique; Selective forwarding attacks; Simulated results; Tamper resistant; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security","Kumar, A.; Information Security Research Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: alok_21@outlook.com","Martinez Perez G.Gomez Marmol F.Thampi S.M.Westphall C.B.Fan C.I.Hu J.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811068973,,,"English","Commun.

Long distance transmission is very expensive in WSNs since power consumption is proportional to dα for transmitting over distance d, where α is path loss exponent in the interval [2:6]. Thus, there is a necessary requirement of relay nodes in the network that are capable of performing data sensing, data aggregation and data routing, as described in various patents. Method: This paper presents a Layered Relay-Medium Access Control (LR-MAC) Protocol for a Personal Area Network. This protocol introduces the concept of multi-layering for the relay (routing) nodes. The protocol is validated by doing extensive simulations in QualNet 6.1 network simulator. The QoS parameters are analyzed for three different deployment strategies viz. random, grid and circular. Results: The results show that LR-MAC Protocol is an efficient technique in terms of improving network lifetime, average throughput and reducing number of packets dropped due to channel access failure in the network; while LR-MAC gives a neutral performance in terms of end-to-end delay in the network. Conclusion: LR-MAC protocol can efficiently work for random deployments as well as for well-planned effective deployments like in smart building monitoring. The network can also be modified for large areas by increasing number of deployed sensor nodes and keeping node density constant. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","Energy efficiency; Energy hole; LR-MAC; Multi-layering; QoS parameters; Relay/routing node; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Personal communication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Deployment strategy; Energy holes; Extensive simulations; Long distance transmission; Multilayering; QoS parameters; Relay/routing node; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Medium access control","Thalore, R.; Department of ECE, College of Engineering and Technology, Mody University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: ranjanathalore.cet@modyuniversity.ac.in",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",22132759,,,,"English","Recent Pat.

The major factor behind the energy consumption inWSN is its data collectionmechanism.The direct data transmission fromeach sensor node to the Base Station (BS) consumes more energy than other alternatives. Also it is unnecessary, due to redundant data transmission because of geographically closer nodes. Clustering is the best data collection architectural model for WSN since it takes care of in-network processing which handles redundant data within the network.The techniques used for the network having uniform node distribution are not suitable for the networks which have nonuniformly distributed nodes. This paper contributes a novel clustering algorithm: Fuzzy Logic Based Energy Efficient Clustering Hierarchy (FLECH) for nonuniformWSN. The clusters in FLECH are created using proper parameters which increases the lifetime of the WSN. Fuzzy logic in FLECH is wisely used to combine important parameters like residual energy, node centrality, and distance to BS for electing best suitable nodes as CH and increases the network lifetime. FLECH performance is verified in different scenarios and the results are compared with LEACH, CHEF, ECPF, EAUCF, and MOFCA.The simulation results clearly indicate the lifetime increase by FLECH over other algorithms and its energy conservation per round of data collection in the network. © 2017 Baranidharan Balakrishnan and Santhi Balachandran.",,"Clustering algorithms; Computer circuits; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Architectural modeling; Data collection; Distributed nodes; Energy Efficient clustering; In-network processing; Network lifetime; Node distribution; Real-time application; Wireless sensor networks","Balakrishnan, B.; School of Computing, SASTRA UniversityIndia; email: baranier85@gmail.com",,"Hindawi Limited",15308669,,,,"English","Wireless Commun.

In this paper, weighted centroid localization algorithm using teaching learning based optimization (WCL-TLBO) is proposed to improve the positioning accuracy in 3D space of WSN. In range-free algorithms, only received signal strength (RSS) information between nodes is sufficient to determine the position of target nodes. RSS value gives the clue to find out the distance between sensor nodes but shows non-linearity between RSS and distance. To overcome this non-linearity, fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used. Edge weights of WCL are modelled using FLS. Further to reduce the errors, TLBO is applied to optimize these edge weights.

The existing schemes used for the DoSL attack detection do not provide an optimal energy conservation and key pairing operation. Hence, in this paper, an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) based denial-of-sleep attack detection (GA-DoSLD) algorithm is suggested for analyzing the misbehaviors of the nodes.The suggested algorithm implements a Modified-RSA (MRSA) algorithm in the base station (BS) for generating and distributing the key pair among the sensor nodes. Before sending/receiving the packets, the sensor nodes determine the optimal route using AdHoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) protocol and then ensure the trustworthiness of the relay node using the fitness calculation. The crossover and mutation operations detect and analyze the methods that the attackers use for implementing the attack. On determining an attacker node, the BS broadcasts the blocked information to all the other sensor nodes in the network. Simulation results prove that the suggested algorithm is optimal compared to the existing algorithms such as X-MAC, ZKP, and TE2P schemes. © 2017 Mahalakshmi Gunasekaran and Subathra Periakaruppan.",,"Computer crime; Denial-of-service attack; Electric substations; Power management (telecommunication); Routers; Sensor nodes; Sleep research; Ad hoc on demand distance vector; Attack detection; Battery powered; Crossover and mutation; Efficient genetic algorithms; Fitness calculation; Optimal routes; SLEEP mode; Genetic algorithms","Gunasekaran, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NPR College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: mahalakshmiit15@hotmail.com",,"Hindawi Limited",19390114,,,,"English","Secur.

As the information from the sensors are transmitted via public network and sensor nodes have limited battery, shift the focus on security and efficiency in WSNs. User authentication is the security task for limiting the access. It is achieved by equipping authorized users with passwords, tokens or biometrics. However, password and token are easy being stolen and forgotten; even biometrics inherit some limitation. More suitable approach is to combine both password and biometric authenticator to harvest benefits in security. This paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs using biohashing. Biohashing facilitates elimination of false accept rates without increasing occurrence of false rejection rate. Additionally, biohashing has highly clear separation of imposter populations and genuine, and zero equal error rate level. The proposed scheme also supports dynamic node addition and user friendly password change mechanism. Using the BAN-logic, we prove that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication. In addition, we simulate proposed scheme for the security against man-in-the middle attack and replay attack using the AVISPA tool, and the simulation results show that our scheme is safe.

A mobile sink travels across WSN and gathers sensor readings via single-hop communication. To deal with data collection latency in delay-sensitive applications, many proposals have investigated techniques based on Rendezvous Points (RPs) where a mobile sink plans a tour that visits a subset of sensor nodes to collect data within a given deadline. In such a WSN, the number of RPs is limited due to the maximum allowed sink tour length. Therefore, in a large WSN, selected RPs are required to forward a large number of packets, which results in early energy depletion.

Due to limited amount of energy in sensors, the network seeks to attain energy efficient routing for prolonging their lifetime. Existing grid based routing protocols reduce the energy dissipation at nodes, however they suffer from congestion. Network congestion may lead to excessive energy consumption, which in turn minimizes the lifetime of network. In this paper, we propose a new Congestion Aware Lifetime Improving Routing Protocol (abbreviated shortly as CALIRP) for grid-based WSNs, which improves the network lifetime by minimizing congestion at nodes. In CALIRP, routing is conducted in a grid by grid manner through the cell-headers. To save the energy and avoid congestion, multiple routing paths are established from the source to the base station. The paths are selected based on Transmitting Factor (TF) of cell-headers which take queue occupancy, queue length and residual energy into account.

The existing energy based CH selection mechanisms consider that all the participating sensors are trustworthy. Conversely, the trust-based CH selection schemes assume that the sensor nodes are energy efficient. But, these assumptions of energy factor or trust assessment made by the CH selection mechanisms may not be true and the Residual Energy (RE) of the sensors may not be the sole factor to identify an effective CH in a WSN. Hence, this paper presents hybrid integrated energy and trust assessment based forecasting model known as Hyper-geometric Energy Factor based Semi-Markov Prediction Mechanism (HEFSPM) for effective CH election so as to improve the lifetime of the network. From the simulation results, it is inferred that HEFSPM is superior in improving the lifetime of the network to a maximum extent of 22 than the existing CH election mechanisms considered for investigation. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Thus helps to reduce the unnecessary energy wastage. Obtaining the link state information is more challenging for EH-WSN as different nodes has different energy profiles and state of the node depends on several environmental conditions. In this paper, we have studied different factors affecting the link quality and model it using finite state Markov Model. Energy availability of the harvesting devices through real time traces is considered for modeling the network.

This work explores the reduction in total energy consumption of WSNs using two-hop data aggregation by constructing an energy-efficient data aggregation tree. An adaptive and hybrid routing algorithm for simultaneous data aggregation and exploitation of the data correlation between nodes using a binary search tree framework is proposed. Routes are chosen to minimise the total energy expended by the network based on the shortest response time to the broadcasting request. In this work, a highly secure asymmetric key cryptography algorithm is developed to provide secure data aggregation among the network. The proposed data aggregation approach is used to resolve the relevant energy, delay, collision and security issues.

Since either method has pros and cons, this paper presents a hybrid approach, called Node Density based Clustering and Multiple Mobile Collection (NDCMMC), to combine the hierarchical routing and ME data collection in WSN. A Number of cluster heads (CHs) are selected and they collect data from normal nodes then MEs collect data from the cluster heads. For a randomly deployed WSN, a new CH selection scheme is based on the node density is proposed. The nodes which are surrounded by more deployed nodes are more likely to be CHs. In this paper, we have implemented multiple Mobile Elements to reduce delay in data gathering and to the increase the network lifetime. The advantage is that, the efficiency of both intra-cluster routing and ME data collection is improved. Low-complexity traveling track planning algorithm is designed for multiple MEs to pass by all CHs. The analytical model of NDCMMC is also developed and the expectation of the sensor power consumption and network lifetime are derived.

Network lifetime can be improved by the efficient use of present sensor nodes in wireless sensor nodes. In this paper, our objective is to deploy and schedule the sensor nodes in such a manner that improves the lifetime and provides a way to distribute the tasks among the sensor nodes that completes the task on the basis of priority and accuracy. Thus, the overall objective of this paper is to calculate the optimised location of sensor nodes contain a fix sensing range and schedule the sensor nodes that maximises the lifetime. The upper bound of network lifetime can be pre-calculated mathematically, we are applying this knowledge to find the locations of sensor nodes that improves the lifetime. Further, the nodes are scheduled and task is distributed among the sensor nodes that achieve this upper bound.

But the rapid developments of the wireless sensor networks are still as imperative research topic due to its deployment issues. This work minimises such issues in an energy efficient way by implementing a collision free data aggregation schedule. This article proposes a hybrid algorithm for data aggregation by constructing a collision free data aggregation tree called HCDA that improves the energy utilisation of the sensor nodes. The operation of HCDA is managed by two algorithms: 1) node discovery algorithm (NDA): each node finds its neighbours and chooses their corresponding child nodes to form a two-hop collision free aggregation tree; 2) hybrid data aggregation (HDA): by applying HDA algorithm on NDA aggregation tree, the sink node achieves the fast data aggregation in a collision free topology. The correctness of HCDA is formally proven and approximation and complexities have been analysed. In data aggregation process, the simulation results confirm the higher performance in terms of throughput, delivery ratio and packet delay. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Collision avoidance; Data aggregation; Energy efficiency; Event detection; Scheduling algorithm","Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Network protocols; Network security; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Aggregation trees; Approximation and complexity; Collision-aware; Data aggregation; Data aggregation tree; Energy efficient; Event detection; Hybrid algorithms; Trees (mathematics)","Gopikrishnan, S.; Department of Information Technology, Karpagam College of EngineeringIndia; email: gopikrishnanme@gmail.com",,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",14709503,,,,"English","Int.

The energy is scarce and a very important resource in WSN and therefore, it forms the focal point of this proposal. The goals of the paper is; (1) Analyze the tracking accuracy for a target moving in WSN with multiple clusters; (2) Understanding type of relation between the energy consumption and tracking accuracy in WSN. In the posed experimental scenario, nodes are uniformly distributed in a cluster and they collaborate to track the target moving with a variable velocity. The distance between target and a nearest sensor node is measured and then sent to cluster head for estimating target location. Accuracies of target locations and tracking is calculated from these distance measurements. In this paper we examine effects of varying noise power on the tracking accuracy, effect of cluster size and node density on the target location accuracy. We also focus on energy consumption with respect to change in noise variance and node sensing range. We establish that increase in cluster size improves target tracking accuracy at the cost of increase in energy consumption. Target detection accuracy is dependent on cluster size, node distribution within cluster and also on accuracy of distance measurements. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cluster; Distance measurement accuracy; Energy efficiency; Target tracking accuracy; Wireless sensor network","Cluster analysis; Clutter (information theory); Distance measurement; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Location; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Detection accuracy; Multiple clusters; Node distribution; Target location; Tracking accuracy; Variable velocities; Within clusters; Target tracking","Patel, N.; Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Sarvajanik College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: niteen.patel@scet.ac.in","Modi N.Verma P.Trivedi B.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811027499,,,"English","Adv.

Two methods are studied for node localization. The first method is based on LNSM (Log Normal Shadowing Model) technique to localize the anchor node and the second method is based on Hybrid TLBO (Teacher Learning Based Optimization Algorithm)-Unilateral technique. In the first approach the ZigBee protocol has been used to localize the node, which uses RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values in dBm. LNSM technique is implemented in the self-designed hardware node and localization is studied for Outdoor location. The statistical analysis using RMSE (root mean square error) for outdoor location is done and distance error found to be 35 mtrs. The same outdoor location has been used and statistical analysis is done for localization of nodes using Hybrid TLBO-Unilateral technique. The Hybrid-TLBO Unilateral technique significantly localizes anchor node with distance error of 0.7 mtrs. The RSSI values obtained are normally distributed and standard deviation in RSSI value is observed as 1.01 for outdoor location.

There is also additional communication overhead associated with sending time-location claims to the BS. A distributed detection mechanism is always a preferred solution to the above kind of problems due to significantly lower communication overhead than their counterparts. In this paper, we proposea distributed replica detection scheme for MWSNs. In this scheme, the deviation in the distance traveled by a node and its replica is recorded by the observer nodes. Every node is an observer node for some nodes in the network. Observers are responsible for maintaining a sliding window of recent time-distance broadcast of the nodes. A replica is detected by an observer based on the degree of violation computed from the deviations recorded using the time-distance sliding window. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve higher detection probability compared to distributed replica detection schemes such as Efficient Distributed Detection (EDD) and Multi-Time-Location Storage and Diffusion (MTLSD). © 2017 Alekha Kumar Mishra et al.",,"Location; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Centralized detections; Communication overheads; Detection probabilities; Detection scheme; Distributed detection; Preferred solutions; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Mishra, A.K.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: alekha.mishra@vit.ac.in",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",15308669,,,,"English","Wireless Commun.

It consists of heterogeneous computing resources connected by a network across dynamic and geographically distributed organisations to create a distributed high performance computing infrastructure. Job scheduling in computational Grid is known as NP-complete problem owing to the problem complexity and intractable nature of the problem. Such a problem could be solved using heuristic algorithms. These types of algorithms have the ability to find a near optimal solution in reasonable time rather than the optimal solution in a very long processing time. The primary objective of the scheduling is to minimise the makespan of the system.

Traditional cryptography methods are not supportable in WSNs as they have high energy and resource constraints. Trust management has been proved to be an effective measure to enhance security as well as to handle threats for WSNs. Trust can be defined as level of reliableness in a node. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering (LEACH) is a cluster based routing protocol for WSN which is superior to direct communication protocol and known for its minimum transmission energy. However, LEACH itself has some limitations related to security. In this paper, an energy efficient and trust aware framework for secure routing in LEACH (EETA-LEACH), has been proposed that improves LEACH protocol by introducing trust to provide secure routing, while maintaining originality of LEACH protocol. This approach is a combination of trust-based routing module and trust management module that works together to select trusted Cluster Head (CH). The simulation results demonstrate that proposed scheme is better in terms of network lifetime and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). It is verified that malicious nodes will not be selected as CH and trust value of a malicious node decreases with time. © 2017 SCPE.","Cluster-Based WSNs; LEACH; Trust Management; Wireless Sensor Networks; WSNs","Energy efficiency; Leaching; Military applications; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster-based; Environment monitoring; Minimum transmission energies; Packet delivery ratio; Resource Constraint; Trust management; WSNs; Network security",,,"West University of Timisoara",18951767,,,,"English","Scalable Comput.

The ultimate challenge of a sensor node is to make the lifetime of the node increase by which the energy consumption is so minimal. This paper addresses a mechanism by which the distance between any source and destination nodes is used by the source nodes to decide whether transmission of the message to destination node must be multi-hop or direct transmission by simply boosting the node power. The network size and the topology are considered for determining the threshold value for the distance based on which the decision is made.
