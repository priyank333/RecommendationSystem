Two methods have been used for further classification. In the first method, E-Gabor is used as a stand-alone feature for classification. Hypersphere-based normalization has been used for normalizing the E-Gabor features, thereby improving the efficiency in the classification of emotions. In the second method, the E-Gabor feature descriptor is fused with Pyramid Histogram of Gradient (PHOG) feature descriptor and projected to a common subspace of six dimensions using the proposed Pearson General Kernel-based Discriminant Analysis (PGK-DA) before classification. In both the methods, Pearson General Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine (PGK-ELM) is used for classification. Experiments conducted on Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE), Cohn Kanade (CK+), Multimedia Understanding Group (MUG), Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW), Oulu-Chinese Academy of Science, Institute of Automation (Oulu-CASIA) and Man–Machine Interaction (MMI) datasets report a classification accuracy of 97.6%, 97.9%, 95.7%, 35.4%, 87.7% and 82.7% with method I and 95.7%, 97.2%, 94.9%, 35.2%, 87.1% and 82.1% with method II, respectively, for seven class emotion detection, which is high when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Discriminant analysis; ELM; Emotion; Facial expression; Gabor,Discriminant analysis; Learning systems; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Classification accuracy; Classification of emotions; Emotion; Extreme learning machine; Facial Expressions; Gabor; State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information),"Alphonse, A.S.; CSE Department, Regional Campus of Anna UniversityIndia; email: sherls82@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027501922

However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance.

Instead of regressing for the motion blur kernel and performing non-blind deblurring outside of the network (as most methods do), we propose a compact and elegant end-to-end deblurring network. Inspired by the data-driven sparse-coding approaches that are capable of capturing linear dependencies in data, we generalize this notion by embedding non-linearities into the learning process. We propose a new architecture for blind motion deblurring that consists of an autoencoder that learns the data prior, and an adversarial network that attempts to generate and discriminate between clean and blurred features. Once the network is trained, the generator learns a blur-invariant data representation which when fed through the decoder results in the final deblurred output. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Blind deblurring; Blur invariants; Data representations; Learning process; Linear dependency; Motion deblurring; Sparse coding; Deep learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15505499,9.78154E+12,PICVE,,English,Proc IEEE Int Conf Comput Vision,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041925681

However, published results on cough sound analysis are generally limited to specific pulmonary diseases (e.g. detection of Whooping cough - Pertussis) and the study sizes are small. In this paper, we present a general framework for cough sound analysis, which includes automatic cough segmentation, feature extraction and a general classification design that can be applied to a wide range of pulmonary diseases. For our analysis, three evidence-based features were selected (variance, kurtosis, and zero crossing irregularity) as well as an additional feature that we developed (rate of decay). Our cough sound analysis framework was tested using voluntary cough data collected from 54 patients presenting a combination of pulmonary conditions (COPD, asthma, and allergic rhinitis) equally sampled from all patients arriving at a pulmonary clinic, as well as 33 healthy individuals. All study subjects were examined with a stethoscope auscultation, clinical questionnaire, and peak flow meter, and were given a full pulmonary function test (spirometer, body plethysmograph, DLCO), which was the gold standard used to determine each patient's diagnosis. When the classifiers were trained using cough sounds alone, the accuracy (as determined by the AUC of the ROC curve) was 74% for Healthy vs Unhealthy, 80% for Obstructive vs non-Obstructive, and 81% for Asthma vs COPD. We also compared the performance of our cough sound analysis against other low-cost diagnostic tools and observed that cough sounds surprisingly had better performance than lung sound auscultation alone, but had significantly lower performance compared to our clinical questionnaire or peak flow meter test. From these data, we conclude that cough sounds have value as a rapid and simple screening tool, but are of less diagnostic value compared to a clinical questionnaire or peak flow meter. © 2017 IEEE.",algorithms; auscultation; cough; diagnostics; intelligence; lung; machine learning; mobile; phone; pulmonary; sounds,Acoustic waves; Algorithms; Biological organs; Cost benefit analysis; Diagnosis; Diagnostic products; Flow measurement; Flowmeters; Learning systems; Plasma diagnostics; Surveys; auscultation; cough; intelligence; lung; mobile; phone; pulmonary; Pulmonary diseases,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"GHTC - IEEE Glob.

Two ANN modules are designed, ANN-D to predict whether a person is using VSA or not and ANN-C to predict the time of use. Input features used are age, gender, country, ethnicity, education, neuroticism, openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, impulsiveness, sensation seeking etc. Input features are given to the ANN-Dmodule to predict if volatile substance abuse (VSA) has been done by the person or not. ANN-C module predicts the use of VSA in terms of time such as day, week, month, year, decade, beforea decade, etc. The accuracy of the ANN-D module is found to be 81% and ANN-C module is 71.9%.

Since medical data usually contains a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity, proper ordering and classification require a proper comparative performance analysis of machine learning classifiers. Machine learning classifiers are applied on the Ovarian Cancer Dataset. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women, and is the deadliest of gynecological cancers. The mortality rate of ovarian cancer ranks first. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving the patients' cure rate and prolonging their survival. Here we have investigated Mass spectrometry (MS) field data to develop a computer-aided system for the purpose. Using machine learning techniques, data is classified in different categories to identify benign and malignant cancerous cells and a comparative study has been done to identify the most suitable technique under different operational conditions and datasets.

The machine learning algorithm we have proposed is the Logit model of the Logical Regression Classifier. As the process of walking is automatically controlled by the nervous system it is important to develop a non-invasive method so that patients with serious neurological disorders like Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease receive early medical attention and they get proper care before they are more affected. Swing, Stance and double support intervals (expressed as percentages of stride) of 63 subjects were analyzed. In this paper, a relevant gait signal feature extractor is developed which is combined with Logistic Regression Classifier to classify healthy subjects and pathological subjects. Analysis of real-time gait signals is simplified using the Hilbert Transform which converts the real signals into an analytic signal.

This technology generates huge amount of gene expression data for biological analysis. Parallel computation methods are required to find functional associations from this large amount of biological data. An unsupervised machine learning technique, clustering algorithm groups similar genes based on entire conditions. But normal clustering methods cannot find different cellular processes from gene expression data because a biological activity can start functioning in the presence of some specific conditions. So, biclustering techniques are used instead of normal clustering. Biclustering basically identifies a set of genes that are co-expressed for some specific experimental conditions. Here we introduce an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm(SFLA) based approach to find biclusters. SFLA is a hybrid of evolutionary memetic algorithm and collective intelligence based particle swarm optimization algorithm. Also It has faster convergence speed. By applying the proposed algorithm on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cell cycle dataset, large number of biologically significant biclusters are obtained, which are verified by gene ontology database, compared to other existing algorithms.

The solution to this problem is to automate the deployment and configuration using templates. These templates allow the users to specify the information about resource requirements of an application. In this paper, firstly, we present the methods for development of complex templates that consist of various properties like input parameters and conditional logic, lacking in existing simple templates. OpenStack is the popularly used private Cloud deployment tool and many other similar tools lack in providing the complex templates in their architecture. The complex templates proposed in this paper are generic in nature and designed keeping OpenStack in mind. Using the proposed complex templates, based on user defined input values and conditional logic, various infrastructure stacks can be created in simple templates and can be directly fed into heat engine for deployment. The complex templates can be developed to accept input parameters, including conditional logic or auto scaling constructs. Though the complex template allows us to specify the requirement in an easy way but it is difficult and sometimes inaccurate, to visualize the outcome. Under such circumstances estimating the billing cost of the infrastructure stack is extremely difficult. In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper secondly, we propose a system that can automate the cost estimation of a stack before its creation. In order to assess the cost estimates, we have implemented machine learning using decision trees on the templates data that can produce the output in the form of two classes and give the decision that whether it is good to deploy templates or not. The preliminary assessment is done on the proposed model and results achieved are produced. © 2017 IEEE.",cloud; Complex Templates; Constructs; HOT; OpenStack; Orchestration; Template,Application programs; Clouds; Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Decision trees; Learning systems; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Trees (mathematics); Complex Templates; Constructs; Openstack; Orchestration; Template; Computer circuits,,Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Regardless of enormous enrollment of students in MOOCs, the amount of dropout students in these courses are too high. For the success of MOOCs, their dropout rates must decrease. As the proportion of continuing and dropout students in MOOCs varies considerably, the class imbalance problem has been observed in normally all MOOCs dataset. Researchers have developed models to predict the dropout students in MOOCs using different techniques. The features, which affect these models, can be obtained during registration and interaction of students with MOOCs' portal. Using results of these models, appropriate actions can be taken for students in order to retain them.

The knowledge obtained from education helps to enhance opportunities in one's employment development. To extract useful information from the knowledge obtained, Educational Data Mining is widely used. Educational data mining provides the process of applying different data mining tools and techniques to analyze and visualize the data of an institution (school) and can be used to discover a unique pattern of students' academic performance and behavior. The present work intends to enhance students' academic performance in secondary school using data mining techniques. Real data was collected using school reports and questionnaire method by the Portugal school which has been used in this paper. Naive Bayesian algorithm can be easily implemented to predict the students' academic performance and behavior. Classification of students into two classes, pass and fail, involves training phase and testing phase. In training phase, Naive Bayes classifier is built and in the testing phase, Naive Bayes classifier is used to make the prediction. The accuracy of the classifier is calculated using WEKA tool in which confusion matrix is generated. The accuracy of the classifier obtained is 87% which can be further improved by the selection of appropriate attributes. Developing the classification algorithms in this way helps to obtain a more efficient student performance predictor tool using other data mining algorithms and it also helps to improve the quality of education in an educational institution. © 2017 IEEE.",Educational Data Mining; Naive Bayes Classifier; WEKA,Classifiers; Learning systems; Students; Classification algorithm; Data mining algorithm; Educational data mining; Educational institutions; Naive Bayes classifiers; Naive Bayesian algorithms; Quality of education; WEKA; Data mining,,Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proceeding - IEEE Int.

HIDSs use the frequency analysis of n-gram terms in the system call traces to identify intrusive processes. However, they are computation and resource intensive as they need to analyze a large number of n-gram input features to differentiate between normal and intrusive system processes. This put a severe limitation on their real time application while analyzing voluminous system call traces. To address this issue, we propose a computation efficient HIDS framework that initially transforms the system call traces to n-gram vector representational model and then uses a dimensionality reduction process to reduce the size of the input feature vectors. The dimensionality reduced n-gram feature vectors are finally analyzed by various machine learning based classifier models to identify intrusive processes.

The course content store in ontology given appropriate LPS using the FPN and HMM algorithm is to tackle the problem of procedural learning by making it adaptive. OPAESFH use Petri Net for modeling e-learning course content and HMM algorithm for adaptability of course content according to the learner's performance in pre-test/post-test. This LPS adjusts itself according to the learner's performance in pre-test/post-test for the e-learning course content. The proposed e-learning system demonstrates that the personalized and adaptive LPS can enhance a learning experience. We evaluate OPAESFH with respect to an experimental and control group and the results that are obtained from the experimental group are better than the results from the control group. © 2017 IEEE.",Adaptive Learning; e-learning system; Fuzzy Petri Net (FPN); Hidden Markov Model (HMM); Ontology; Personalized Learning,Curricula; E-learning; Hidden Markov models; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Ontology; Petri nets; Semantics; Adaptive e-learning systems; Adaptive learning; Adaptive learning styles; Back-ground knowledge; Fuzzy Petri net (FPN); Learning experiences; Personalized learning; Procedural learning; Learning systems,"Rani, M.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: monikarani1988@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044238907

However, the accuracy of these systems still needs significant improvement in order to meet the necessity of real world diagnostic situations. In this paper, an efficient PBDS based on MR images is proposed that markedly improves the recent results. The proposed system makes use of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the quality of the input MR images. Thereafter, fast discrete curvelet transform via wrapping (FDCT-WR) strategy is harnessed to extract curve like features from the preprocessed images. Subsequently, the dimensionality of the features is reduced using PCA+LDA approach. Finally, a novel improved learning algorithm called IHPSO-ELM is proposed that combines self-organizing hierarchical PSO (HPSO) and extreme learning machine (ELM) for segregation of MR images as pathological or healthy. The HPSO is utilized to optimize the input weights and hidden biases of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFN), whereas one analytical method is used for determining the output weights. The proposed algorithm performs optimization according to both the root mean squared error (RMSE) and norm of the output weights of SLFNs. Extensive experiments are carried out using three benchmark datasets and the results are compared against other competent schemes. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme offers better performance compared to its counterparts. Further, it has been noticed that the proposed IHPSO-ELM obtains higher accuracy and compact network architecture than conventional learning methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Extreme learning machine; Fast discrete curvelet transform via wrapping; Pathological brain detection; Self-organizing hierarchical PSO,Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mean square error; Network architecture; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Analytical method; Benchmark datasets; Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE); Extreme learning machine; Fast discrete curvelet transforms; Root mean squared errors; Self-organizing hierarchical PSO; Singlehidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN); Image enhancement,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044199912

In literature many previous study has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers. Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the (classification, prediction, function approximation, etc.) performance of a model, or in other words it reduces the likelihood of the selection of a poor classifier or model. This paper focus on the fundamental concept of ensemble classifiers reviews the different ensemble techniques (Boosting, Bagging, and Random Forest) especially useful for remote sensing. Random Forest is one of the most popular ensemble classifier. In this paper, more emphasis is given to RF classifier and various application domain of this ensemble classifier for satellite image processing.

The proposed work aims at classifying the pronation and supination movements of the forearm. The primary actuators of these movements are located in the forearm whereas upper arm muscles provide assistance. Instead of forearm muscles, upper arm muscles namely biceps brachii and triceps brachii are chosen for sEMG signal collection. This makes it suitable for the development of an arm orthosis even if the person has a below elbow amputation. Features extracted from the pre-processed sEMG are used as predictors for machine learning (ML) algorithms. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and random forest (RF) are the machine learning algorithms addressed in this work. Each feature is used individually to train MLPNN to distinguish between pronation and supination. Two features namely IEMG (Integrated EMG) and SSC (Number of Slope Sign changes) were chosen as best predictors from experimentation. These two features were used together for prediction but the improvement was not satisfactory. Effects of using delayed inputs were studied, and it improved the classification by a considerable margin. RF model was then trained with the same predictor set, and it outperformed MLPNN. The average classification accuracy for MLPNN was 91.6%, and that of RF was 97.7%. © 2017 IEEE.",machine learning; movement classification; neural network; pronation; random forest; sEMG; supination,Artificial intelligence; Biomedical signal processing; Decision trees; Electromyography; Learning systems; Muscle; Neural networks; Classification accuracy; Human Machine Interface; Multi layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN); pronation; Random forests; sEMG; supination; Surface electromyography; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044173445

In this paper, machine learning algorithms use the features extracted through HRV analysis performed on ECG samples of chronic alcohol users and normative subjects, in order to classify them. To carry out the classification, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) have been trained, and their performance has been compared. While time domain, frequency domain and non-linear features are generally extracted from ECG signals for HRV analysis, in this study a new set of features obtained from Autoregressive Modelling using Exogenous (ARX) Inputs have also been used to improve the accuracy of the algorithms. An accuracy of 80.36% and 89.29% was achieved by SVM and ELM respectively without the use of ARX coefficients, while an accuracy of 87.50% and 94.64% was achieved when ARX coefficients were included in the feature set.

A recommender system for niche application requires more accuracy as it targets a specific audience or a specific genre of products to recommend. Certain examples of niche domains include course recommendation for university courses, text recommendation for translators etc. In this paper, we address the problem of designing a recommender system for one such niche domain, a course recommender system. It generates recommendation of university courses for students based on the courses previously preferred by the student. Since such recommendations play a role similar to decision support systems for students, it is evident that it has to be relevant in predicting preferences. Also, every new choice made by the user unfolds additional information about a user which was previously unknown to the system. Literature suggests that course recommender systems have been developed mostly without the use of machine learning techniques. Treating student preference information as a general recommendation problem, it can be represented in a matrix format and generating a low-rank matrix representation have provided encouraging results. Inclusion of additional information in order to make more accurate predictions, leads to higher computational complexity and instability in learning parameters. To overcome such hurdles in designing a Course Recommender System, we propose a similarity based regularization for low-rank matrix factorization algorithm which learns the prediction matrix very fast and is stable. © 2017 IEEE.",Course Recommender System Recommender System; Low-rank matrix factorization; Online Matrix Completion,Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; E-learning; Factorization; Forecasting; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Online systems; Students; Accurate prediction; Learning parameters; Low-rank matrices; Machine learning techniques; Niche applications; Online matrix; Preference information; University course; Recommender systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044199023

This is a tertiary study that follows the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process as put forth by Kitchenham in her seminal paper, based on five criteria: estimation technique, estimation accuracy, type of dataset and independent variables used in empirical research on effort estimation. Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates. There is increasing consensus on the use of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and Prediction Pred (25%) as the accuracy metric. 78% of the Primary Studies reported accuracy using MMRE.

The filter based approach is independent of the nature of induction algorithms used for the classification purposes and therefore offers several advantages over other approaches such as wrappers. This property of filter approach has been exploited in this study to obtain a generic feature subset that can be used with any induction algorithm. For this purpose, fourteen distinct single and simultaneous PQ events were simulated following IEEE Std. 1159. The feature selection of these events is accomplished through a combination of meta-heuristic search method and correlation based feature evaluation. Two meta-heuristic search methods based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) have been included for the comparison of search performance. The efficacy of reduced feature subsets is evaluated through induction algorithm based on Naive-Bayes. The results convincingly demonstrated that it is possible to obtain significant reduction in the features (approx. 50% with GA, 86% with BPSO) without any compromise in the classification performance. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Dimensionality Reduction; Feature Correlation; Feature Selection; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning; Particle Swarm Optimization; Power Quality,Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Modular robots; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power quality; Binary particle swarm optimization; Classification performance; Dimensionality reduction; Feature correlation; Induction algorithms; Meta-heuristic search; Power quality event; Search performance; Feature extraction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044226516

This paper addresses a similar issue where the fitness of an individual can be predicted by analyzing few attributes associated with that individual. A hybrid classifier algorithm is developed by merging Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms which will classify the Fitness data set. The nature of the data set is such that the classification accuracy does not reach the desired levels with individual classifiers but when classification is carried out with the hybrid classifier the classification accuracy is enhanced by 15.79% as compared to Decision Tree and 3.6% when compared with Naïve Bayes classifier. This concept displays an approach where tailor made hybrid data mining algorithms can be developed for classifying particular data sets which have unique nature and require specific classification requirements for better accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.,2]; 4]; Decision Tree classifier; Hybrid classifier; Naïve Bayes classifier; R Studio[3; WEKA[1,Data mining; Decision trees; Learning systems; Medical computing; Trees (mathematics); Bayes Classifier; Decision tree classifiers; Hybrid classifier; R Studio[3; WEKA[1; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This implements an evolved node base station (eNB). The Integrated eNB's in 4G network are responsible for seamless switching between different technologies and channels. Such a switching decision is often affected by several parameters like available bandwidth, desired load, inter channel interference, available signal to noise ratio, fading, downlink power and so on. Regular switching between channels result in waste of a portion of bandwidth in control signal whereas delayed switching results in low packet delivery ratio and in turn low data rate. Hence, an optimal solution is desired to maintain high data rate under scalable 4G network. In this work, we propose an optimal resource allocation and power allocation using a Feed Forward Neural Network based machine learning framework for channel condition classification. The system is trained with probe packets under controlled conditions. The eNB nodes then manage the channel resources based on resource constraints during communication of performance parameters. Results shows that the proposed system improves effective data rate and packet delivery ratio in comparison with conventional linear techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",eNB; LTE; Neural network and resource allocation,4G mobile communication systems; Bandwidth; Heterogeneous networks; Learning systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Queueing networks; Resource allocation; Satellite communication systems; Signal to noise ratio; Switching; Controlled conditions; Interchannel interference; Long term evolution networks; LTE heterogeneous networks; Optimal resource allocation; Packet delivery ratio; Performance parameters; Resource allocation schemes; Wireless telecommunication systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

An average of seventeen minutes and considerable amount of fuel is wasted in an effort to find a parking spot every time. Additional stress is induced due to parking hassles starting from finding an empty parking spot to relocating the car later. We propose a system leveraging the latest technologies that will help motorists overcome their parking problems and at the same time, make managing a parking space easier and cost effective by automating the entire process right from pre-booking a parking slot to making the payment. Since most of the parking spaces are equipped with CCTV surveillance cameras, we intend to use them to detect the presence of cars and measure the availability of parking spots within a parking space using techniques like image processing and machine learning. In order to test the performance of the proposed system, a prototype of the system is built that mimics the working of an actual parking space excluding minute details. A prototype of the application is built that would aid the user in booking the slot and guide him/her back to the allocated parking slot.

Frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark have gained a lot of traction over the past decades and have become massively popular, especially in industries. It is becoming increasingly evident that effective big data analysis is key to solving artificial intelligence problems. Thus, a multi-algorithm library was implemented in the Spark framework, called MLlib. While this library supports multiple machine learning algorithms, there is still scope to use the Spark setup efficiently for highly time-intensive and computationally expensive procedures like deep learning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the distributive computational abilities of Apache Spark and the advanced machine learning architecture of a deep multi-layer perceptron (MLP), using the popular concept of Cascade Learning. We conduct empirical analysis of our framework on two real world datasets. The results are encouraging and corroborate our proposed framework, in turn proving that it is an improvement over traditional big data analysis methods that use either Spark or Deep learning as individual elements. © 2017 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Data handling; Data mining; Deep learning; Information analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Algorithm libraries; Apache hadoop; Computational ability; Empirical analysis; Library support; Multi layer perceptron; Multiple machine; Real-world datasets; Big data,,Gottumukkala R.Karypis G.Raghavan V.Wu X.Miele L.Aluru S.Ning X.Dong G.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This requires the bending and cutting of the rebar to proper size before they can be used for construction. A novel haptic based barbending simulator has been devised which enables the trainees to learn and improve the construction rebar bending skill in a safe and controlled way. With its limited assessment and reporting features, the computerised virtual training simulator proves to be effective in training. Adding the features like personalized skill tracking and predictive performance modeling holds even more potential in supporting the training program. Towards this goal, a user performance modeling needs to be done which includes an initial study on performance parameters, assessment criteria and data collection before remodeling the simulator. This paper presents a study on the performance parameters for the bar bending simulator and also evaluates its effectiveness in modeling expert and novice performances. During this study we also hypothesize the parameters that can distinguish an expert and novice performances which was validated with 2 classification techniques - Support vector machine and J48 Decision tree. While revealing the classification rules J48 algorithm provides 78.94% accuracy where as SVM provides 94.737% accuracy.

The nature of this data being truly heterogeneous, high in volume and also highly dynamic over time, the problem of collecting these data artifacts from disparate sources, to enable complete user-profiling can be challenging. In this paper, we present an approach to dynamically build a structured user profile, that emphasizes the temporal nature to capture dynamic user behavior. The user profile is compiled from multiple, heterogeneous data sources which capture dynamic user actions over time, to capture changing preferences accurately. Natural language processing techniques, machine learning and concepts of the semantic Web were used for capturing relevant user data and implement the proposed '3D User Profile'. Our technique also supports the representation of the generated user profiles as structured data so that other personalized recommendation systems and Semantic Web/Linked Open Data applications can consume them for providing intelligent, personalized services. © 2017 IEEE.",Dynamic user profile; Personalization; Recommender Systems; Semantic Web; Temporal profiling,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Location based services; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Semantic Web; Telecommunication services; Websites; Heterogeneous data sources; Natural languages; Personalizations; Personalized recommendation systems; Personalized service; Specific information; Temporal profiling; User profile; Behavioral research,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Customer preferences, options and experiences can be analyzed through social media, reviews, blogs and other online social networking site data. However, due to increasing informal usage of local languages in social media platforms, multi-lingual or code-mixed data is fast becoming a common occurrence. Mixed code is generated when users use more than a single language in social network comments. Such data presents a significant challenge for applications using sentiment analysis and is yet to be fully explored by researchers. Existing sentiment analysis methods applied to monolingual social data are not suitable for code-mixed data due to the inconsistency in the grammatical structure in these sentences. In this paper, a novel method focused on performing effective sentiment analysis of bilingual sentences written in Hindi and English is proposed, that takes into account linguistic code switching and the grammatical transitions between the two considered languages. Experimental evaluation using real-world, code-mixed datasets obtained from Facebook showed that the proposed approach achieved very good accuracy and was also efficient performance-wise. © 2017 IEEE.",Code-mixed data; grammatical transitions; lexical analysis; Machine Learning; Sentiment analysis,Codes (symbols); Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Network coding; Domain-specific sentiment analysis; Experimental evaluation; Grammatical structure; Lexical analysis; Mixed data; Online social networkings; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Social networking (online),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

An effective software change prediction model should equally recognize change-prone and not change-prone classes with high accuracy. However, this is not the case as software practitioners often have to deal with imbalanced data sets where instances of one type of class is much higher than the other type. In such a scenario, the minority classes are not predicted with much accuracy leading to strategic losses.

Among different variants of rough clustering, rough-probabilistic clustering is a new concept introduced recently. In rough-probabilistic clustering, a class is defined as the union of two disjoint regions, namely, a crisp lower approximation region and a probabilistic boundary region. In this regard, stomped normal (SN) distribution provides a statistical modeling of the data set in rough-probabilistic clustering framework. The SN distribution models the central tendency, dispersion, and width of the lower approximation region of each class using its mean, variance, and width parameter, respectively. However, it does not take into consideration the property of kurtosis of the class distribution, which controls the concentration of values around mean and shape of the tail of data distribution. In this background, a novel probability distribution, named stomped-t (St) distribution, is introduced in the paper for rough-probabilistic clustering. The proposed probability distribution incorporates the property of kurtosis into the SN framework. The proposed St probability distribution is then integrated within the rough-probabilistic clustering framework for precise and robust clustering of the data. The efficacy of the proposed clustering algorithm is demonstrated for unsupervised data clustering and image segmentation problems, along with a comparative performance analysis with related algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Expectation-maximization algorithm; Hidden Markov random field model; Image segmentation; Rough-probabilistic clustering; Stomped normal distribution,Cluster analysis; Data mining; Higher order statistics; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Markov processes; Maximum principle; Normal distribution; Pattern recognition; Probability; Probability distributions; Class distributions; Comparative performance analysis; Distribution models; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Hidden Markov random field model; Lower approximation; Probabilistic clustering; Statistical modeling; Clustering algorithms,"Maji, P.; Biomedical Imaging and Bioinformatics Lab, Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: pmaji@isical.ac.in",,Elsevier Inc.,200255,,ISIJB,,English,Inf Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028731427

Cyber criminals exploit this spur in user engagement levels to spread malicious content that compromises system reputation, causes financial losses and degrades user experience. In this paper, we collect and characterize a dataset of 4.4 million public posts generated on Facebook during 17 news-making events (natural calamities, sports, terror attacks, etc.) over a 16-month time period. From this dataset, we filter out two sets of malicious posts, one using URL blacklists and another using human annotations. Our observations reveal some characteristic differences between malicious posts obtained from the two methodologies, thus demanding a twofold filtering process for a more complete and robust filtering system. We empirically confirm the need for this twofold filtering approach by cross-validating supervised learning models obtained from the two sets of malicious posts. These supervised learning models include Naive Bayesian, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine-based models. Based on this learning, we implement Facebook Inspector, a REST API-based browser plug-in for identifying malicious Facebook posts in real time. Facebook Inspector uses class probabilities obtained from two independent supervised learning models based on a Random Forest classifier to identify malicious posts in real time. These supervised learning models are based on a feature set comprising of 44 features and achieve an accuracy of over 80% each, using only publicly available features. During the first 9 months of its public deployment (August 2015–May 2016), Facebook Inspector processed 0.97 million posts at an average response time of 2.6 s per post and was downloaded over 2500 times.

Specifically, it functions by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), or hypervisor. The reconstructed semantic details obtained by the VMI are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor. In order to distinguish between these two states, the existing out-of-VM security solutions require extensive manual analysis. In this paper, we propose an advanced VMM-based, guest-assisted Automated Internal-and-External (A-IntExt) introspection system by leveraging VMI, Memory Forensics Analysis (MFA), and machine learning techniques at the hypervisor. Further, we use the VMI-based technique to introspect digital artifacts of the live guest OS to obtain a semantic view of the processes details. We implemented an Intelligent Cross View Analyzer (ICVA) and implanted it into our proposed A-IntExt system, which examines the data supplied by the VMI to detect hidden, dead, and dubious processes, while also predicting early symptoms of malware execution on the introspected guest OS in a timely manner. Machine learning techniques are used to analyze the executables that are mined and extracted using MFA-based techniques and ascertain the malicious executables. The practicality of the A-IntExt system is evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables onto the live guest OSs. The evaluation results achieved 99.55% accuracy and 0.004 False Positive Rate (FPR) on the 10-fold cross-validation to detect unknown malware on the generated dataset.

Modelling of the emotion recognition process serves to understand as well as assess the performance of the system. This paper compares two different models for speech emotion recognition using vocal tract features namely, the first four formants and their respective bandwidths. The first model is based on a decision tree and the second one employs logistic regression. Whereas the decision tree models are based on machine learning, regression models have a strong statistical basis. The logistic regression models and the decision tree models developed in this work for several cases of binary classifications were validated by speech emotion recognition experiments conducted on a Malayalam emotional speech database of 2800 speech files, collected from ten speakers. The models are not only simple, but also meaningful since they indicate the contribution of each predictor. The experimental results indicate that speech emotion recognition using formants and bandwidths was better modelled using decision trees, which gave higher emotion recognition accuracies compared to logistic regression. The highest accuracy obtained using decision tree was 93.63%, for the classification of positive valence emotional speech as surprised or happy, using seven features. When using logistic regression for the same binary classification, the highest accuracy obtained was 73%, with eight features. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Decision trees; Logistic regression; Modelling; Speech emotion recognition,Bandwidth; Binary trees; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Fisher information matrix; Learning systems; Models; Regression analysis; Speech; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Trees (mathematics); Binary classification; Decision tree models; Emotion recognition; Emotional speech; Logistic regression models; Logistic regressions; Regression model; Speech emotion recognition; Speech recognition,"Jacob, A.; Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation, Government Engineering CollegeIndia; email: agneswills3@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13812416,,ISTEF,,English,Int J Speech Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029584048

Several countermeasures to thwart such analysis have been also proposed in the related cryptographic literature. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel combination of power and fault analysis strategies to devise attacks against such protected implementations of Grain stream cipher. We considered clock glitch induced faults occurring in practice to construct our fault model. In addition, we developed a generic power analysis attack technique against the Grain family of stream ciphers assuming that the cipher implementation can be resynchronized multiple times with a fixed secret key and any randomly generated initialization vector. Subsequently, we combine our proposed power analysis strategy with the notion of the practically occurring faults to mount attacks on various fault attack countermeasures. In order to validate our proposed power analysis attack, we report the results of power trace classifications of a Grain v1 implementation on SASEBO-GII board. The captured power traces were analyzed using least squares support vector machine learning algorithm-based multiclass classifiers to segregate the power traces into the respective Hamming distance (HD) classes. To extract power samples with high information about HD classes, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric was chosen for feature selection. The experimental results of power trace classifications of test set showed success rate as high as 92.5% when the seven largest SNR sample instants over a clock cycle were chosen as features along with a suitable kernel hyperparameter combination. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Clock glitch; differential power analysis; fault attack countermeasures; Grain stream cipher; least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM); SASEBO-GII board,Classification (of information); Clocks; Cryptography; Hamming distance; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Signal to noise ratio; Support vector machines; Differential power Analysis; Fault attack countermeasures; Least squares support vector machines; SASEBO-GII; Stream Ciphers; Side channel attack,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2780070,,ITCSD,,English,IEEE Trans Comput Aided Des Integr Circuits Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040672575

Four bi-modal derivative sigmoidal adaptive activation function is used as the activation function at the hidden layer of a single hidden layer sigmoidal feedforward artificial neural networks. These four bi-modal derivative activation functions are grouped as asymmetric and anti-symmetric activation functions (in groups of two each). For the purpose of comparison, the logistic function (an asymmetric function) and the function obtained by subtracting 0.5 from it (an anti-symmetric) function is also used as activation function for the hidden layer nodes’. The resilient backpropagation algorithm with improved weight-tracking (iRprop+) is used to adapt the parameter of the activation functions and also the weights and/or biases of the sigmoidal feedforward artificial neural networks. The learning tasks used to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed mechanism are 10 function approximation tasks and four real benchmark problems taken from the UCI machine learning repository.

Discretization before attribute reduction will result in high computation cost as many irrelevant and redundant attributes need to be discretized. Attribute reduction before discretization may result in over-fitting of the data leading to low performance of the induction algorithm. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid algorithm using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and extended forward tentative selection with backward propagation of selection decision (EFTSBPSD) algorithm for attribute reduction on real-valued data in rough set theory (RST). Based on the principle of indiscernibility, the hybrid ABC–EFTSBPSD algorithm performs discretization and attribute reduction together. The hybrid ABC–EFTSBPSD algorithm takes as input the decision system consisting of real-valued attributes and determines a near optimal set of irreducible cuts. Here, optimality of the set of irreducible cuts is defined in terms of the cardinality of the set of irreducible cuts. Reduct is obtained from the determined approximate optimal set of irreducible cuts by extracting the attributes corresponding to the cuts in the obtained set of irreducible cuts. The proposed hybrid algorithm is tested on various data sets from University of California Machine Learning Repository. Experimental results obtained by the proposed hybrid algorithm are compared with those obtained by the Q-MDRA, ACO-RST and IMCVR algorithms described in the literature and found to give better classification accuracy when tested using (1) C4.5 classifier and (2) SVM classifier. The proposed hybrid algorithm has also shown reduced length of the reduct in comparison with the results obtained by Q-MDRA, ACO-RST and IMCVR algorithms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial bee colony algorithm; Attribute reduction; Boolean reasoning; Discretization; FTSBPSD algorithm; Indiscernibility; Rough set theory,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Data reduction; Decision theory; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Set theory; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Attribute reduction; Boolean reasoning; Discretizations; Indiscernibility; Rough set theory,"Chebrolu, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology WarangalIndia; email: srilatha.chebrolu@nitw.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983390094

In general, when an individual engages with an object, say Facebook, Instagram, a Mobile game, or anything else, we know that there is some interest that the person has in the object. However, we do not have a procedure that can tell us by “how much” of a factor is the person interested. Simply put, can we find a “number” for someone’s interest? In this article, we propose the design of a framework that can handle this issue. We formulate the interest estimation problem as a state estimation problem and deduce interest indirectly from the activity. Activity, stimulated by interest, is measured via a subjective-objective weighted approach. Further, we present a novel continuous-time model for interest by drawing inspiration from Physics and Economics simultaneously. We model interest along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in Physics and improve the performance by borrowing ideas from Stochastic Volatility Models in Economics. Subsequently, we employ particle filter to solve the interest estimation problem. To validate the feasibility of the proposed theory in practice, we investigate the model by conducting numerical simulations on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate good performance of the framework, and thus match the theoretical expectations from the method. Lastly, we implement the framework in practice and deploy it as a RESTful service, thereby providing a uniform interface for accessing the procedure via any remote or local application. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Artificial intelligence; Interest; Interest estimation; Machine learning; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Statistical application; Stochastic volatility models,Artificial intelligence; Continuous time systems; Economic analysis; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Automated approach; Continuous time modeling; Estimation problem; Interest; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Real-world datasets; Stochastic Volatility Model; Uniform interface; Stochastic models,"Ahmed, T.; Indian Institute of Technology IndoreIndia; email: phd12120101@iiti.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,0924669X,,APITE,,English,Appl Intell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020120724

Though a level of saturation has been obtained in machine printed character recognition, there still remains a void while recognizing handwritten scripts. We, in this paper, have summarized all the existing research efforts on the recognition of printed as well as handwritten Odia alphanumeric characters. Odia is a classical and popular language in the Indian subcontinent used by more than 50 million people. In spite of its rich history, popularity and usefulness, not much research efforts have been made to achieve human level accuracy in case of Odia OCR. This review is expected to serve a benchmark reference for research on Odia character recognition and inspire OCR research communities to make tangible impact on its growth. Here several preprocessing methodologies, segmentation approaches, feature extraction techniques and classifier models with their respective accuracies so far reported are critically reviewed, evaluated and compared. The shortcomings and deficiencies in the current state-of-the-art are discussed in detail for each stage of character recognition. A new handwritten alphanumeric character database for Odia is created and reported in this paper in order to address the paucity of benchmark Odia database. From the existing research work, future research paradigms on Odia character recognition are suggested.

The purpose of this model is to support better investment decisions by forecasting the option price with high predictive accuracy. To further reduce the forecasting error, we incorporate a homogeneity hint (i.e., training the model by categorizing the options data based on moneyness and time-to-maturity of the option contract) into the model. We examine the feasibility and effectiveness of this model using a case study to predict the one-day-ahead price of index options traded in the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. Our experimental results show that the proposed new hybrid model is viable and effective and provides better predictive performance as compared with our benchmark models (standard BS Model, standard Monte Carlo, standard finite difference model, and standard SVR Model). For example, the proposed hybrid model using SVR improved, respectively, the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error by 83.66 and 85.46 % (D1 dataset), 78.02 and 76.0 % (D2 dataset), 91.86 and 90.62 % (D3 dataset), and 87.7 and 90.29 % (D4 dataset), when compared with the benchmarked BS model.

The slope failures are due to adverse inherent geological conditions triggered by an external factor. This paper proposes a new method for the prediction of displacement of step-like landslides, by accounting the controlling factors, using recently proposed extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. ELANFIS reduces the computational complexity of conventional ANFIS by incorporating the theoretical idea of extreme learning machines (ELM). The rainfall data and reservoir level elevation data are also integrated into the study. The nonlinear original landslide displacement series, rainfall data, and reservoir level elevation data are first converted into a limited number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and one residue. Then decomposed displacement data are predicted by using appropriate ELANFIS model. Final prediction is obtained by the summation of outputs of all ELANFIS sub models. The performance of proposed the technique is tested for the prediction Baishuihe and Shiliushubao landslides.

Because of the wide variation in financial time-series data, instead of using only a single standard prediction technique like SVR, we propose a hybrid model called USELM-SVR. It is a combination of unsupervised extreme learning machine (US-ELM)-based clustering and SVR forecasting. We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of this hybrid model using a case study, predicting the one-, two-, and three-day ahead closing values of the energy commodity futures index traded on the Multi Commodity Exchange in India. Our experimental results show that the USELM-SVR is viable and effective, and produces better forecasts than our benchmark models (standard SVR, a hybrid of SVR with self-organizing map (SOM) clustering, and a hybrid of SVR with k-means clustering). Moreover, the proposed USELM-SVR architecture is useful as an alternative model for prediction tasks when we require more accurate predictions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Energy commodity futures index; Financial time series; Hybrid model; Internal cluster validity index; Support vector regression (SVR); Unsupervised extreme learning machine (US-ELM),Conformal mapping; Finance; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Self organizing maps; Time series; Cluster validity indices; Energy commodity; Extreme learning machine; Financial time series; Hybrid model; Support vector regression (SVR); Financial markets,"Das, S.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Science and Technology, Palur Hills, India; email: shomdas@yahoo.com",,Springer Verlag,18659284,,,,English,Memetic Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968560926

We propose to use a feature matching cost which is defined using the learned hierarchical features of given left and right stereo images and we combine it with the pixel-based intensity matching cost in our energy function. Hierarchical features are learned using the deep deconvolutional network which is trained in an unsupervised way using a database consisting of large number of stereo images. In order to perform the regularization, we propose to use the inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random field (IGMRF) and sparsity priors in our energy function. A sparse autoencoder-based approach is proposed for learning and inferring the sparse representation of disparities. The IGMRF prior captures the smoothness as well as preserves sharp discontinuities while the sparsity prior captures the sparseness in the disparity map. Finally, an iterative two-phase algorithm is proposed to estimate the dense disparity map where in phase one, sparse representation of disparities are inferred from the trained sparse autoencoder, and IGMRF parameters are computed, keeping the disparity map fixed and in phase two, the disparity map is refined by minimizing the energy function using graph cuts, with other parameters fixed. Experimental results on the Middlebury stereo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017 The Author(s).",Disparity; IGMRF; Sparsity; Stereo; Unsupervised feature learning,Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Markov processes; Disparity; IGMRF; Sparsity; Stereo; Unsupervised feature learning; Stereo image processing,"Nahar, S.; LNM Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: sonam@lnmiit.ac.in",,Information Processing Society of Japan,18826695,,,,English,IPSJ Trans.

This imbalance problem is almost ubiquitous in biological datasets. Resampling is one of the common methods to deal with the imbalanced dataset problem. In this study, we explore the learning performance by varying the balancing ratios of training datasets, consisting of the observed peptides and absent peptides in the Mass Spectrometry experiment on the different machine learning algorithms. It has been observed that the ideal balancing ratio has yielded better performance than the imbalanced dataset, but it was not the best as compared to some intermediate ratio. By experimenting using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) at different balancing ratios, we obtained the best results by achieving sensitivity of 92.1%, specificity value of 94.7%, overall accuracy of 93.4%, MCC of 0.869, and AUC of 0.982 with boosted random forest algorithm. This study also identifies the most discriminating features by applying the feature ranking algorithm.

This non-deterministic nature of algorithms such as the K-Means clustering algorithm limits their applicability in areas such as cancer subtype prediction using gene expression data. It is hard to sensibly compare the results of such algorithms with those of other algorithms. The non-deterministic nature of K-Means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroids. Method We propose an improved, density based version of K-Means, which involves a novel and systematic method for selecting initial centroids. The key idea of the algorithm is to select data points which belong to dense regions and which are adequately separated in feature space as the initial centroids. Results We compared the proposed algorithm to a set of eleven widely used single clustering algorithms and a prominent ensemble clustering algorithm which is being used for cancer data classification, based on the performances on a set of datasets comprising ten cancer gene expression datasets. The proposed algorithm has shown better overall performance than the others. Conclusion There is a pressing need in the Biomedical domain for simple, easy-to-use and more accurate Machine Learning tools for cancer subtype prediction. The proposed algorithm is simple, easy-to-use and gives stable results. Moreover, it provides comparatively better predictions of cancer subtypes from gene expression data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cancer subtype prediction; Centroid initialization; Clustering; Density based; Gene expression data; K-Means,"Classification (of information); Diseases; Forecasting; Gene expression; Learning systems; Cancer subtypes; Centroid initializations; Clustering; Density-based; Gene Expression Data; K-means; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; Article; brain tumor; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; comparative study; consensus; data base; density; gene expression; K means clustering; medulloblastoma; prediction; priority journal; cluster analysis; gene expression profiling; genetic database; genetics; human; metabolism; neoplasm; procedures; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Neoplasms","Nidheesh, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology CalicutIndia; email: nidheesh.n@nitc.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,29100115,English,Comput.

It has been further seen that such engagements result in huge amount of user-generated content (UGC) from both individuals and organizations combined. This UGC can be analyzed in multiple ways to mine useful information. One such popular domain that uses this information is content buzz/popularity. The content shared on social media platforms becomes popular and subsequently viral when shared and propagated by a larger audience at a faster pace. Organizations are leveraging this power of social media in the domain of content buzz and virality by employing various buzz monitoring techniques to boost the reach of their content. This study thus proposes a hybrid artificial bee colony approach integrated with k-nearest neighbors to identify and segregate buzz in Twitter. A set of metrics comprising of created discussions, increase in authors, attention level, burstiness level, contribution sparseness, author interaction, author count and average length of discussions are used to model the buzz. The proposed approach considers the buzz discussions as outliers deviating from the normal discussions and identifies the same using the proposed hybrid bio-inspired approach.

This paper presents a feature selection-based hybrid-bagging algorithm (FS-HB) for improved credit risk evaluation. The 2 feature selection methods chi-square and principal component analysis were used for ranking and selecting the important features from the datasets. The classifiers were built on 5 training and test data partitions of the input data set. The performance of the hybrid algorithm was compared with that of the standalone classifiers: feature selection-based classifiers and bagging. The hybrid FS-HB algorithm performed best for qualitative dataset with less features and tree-based unstable base classifier. Its performance on numeric data was also better than other standalone classifiers, whereas comparable to bagging with only selected features. Its performance was found better on 70:30 data partition and the type II error, which is very significant in risk evaluation was also reduced significantly. The improved performance of FS-HB is attributed to the important features used for developing the classifier thereby reducing the complexity of the algorithm and the use of ensemble methodology, which added to the classical bias variance trade-off and performed better than standalone classifiers.

In this research work, the severity of cracks in the supporting column is assessed using a new technique. This piece of research study uses the soft computing method of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to model the domain experts’ knowledge and the knowledge assimilated through relevant literature to grade the severity of cracks in supporting column. The FCM grading model is further improved by using the Hebbian learning algorithms. The presented work demonstrates the classification and prediction capabilities of FCM for the respective structural health monitoring application, using two well-known and efficient FCM learning approaches viz. nonlinear Hebbian learning (NHL) and data-driven nonlinear Hebbian learning (DD-NHL). The proposed crack severity grading model classifies the cracks in supporting column into three categories, namely fine crack, moderate crack and severe crack. The proposed model uses DD-NHL algorithm. DD-NHL is trained with 70 records and tested with 30 records and gives an overall classification accuracy of 96 %. The obtained results are better compared to other popular machine learning-based classifiers. The proposed method helps even the non-experts to find the possible causes of crack and reports them to structural engineers, to start maintenance in an appropriate stage, using various crack control techniques. Also, a software tool for crack categorization was developed based on the FCM method and its learning capabilities.

Current screening tools use stand-alone plaque texture-based features and therefore lack the ability to stratify the risk. Method This IRB approved study presents a novel strategy for coronary artery disease risk stratification using an amalgamation of IVUS plaque texture-based and wall-based measurement features. Due to common genetic plaque makeup, carotid plaque burden was chosen as a gold standard for risk labels during training-phase of machine learning (ML) paradigm. Cross-validation protocol was adopted to compute the accuracy of the ML framework. A set of 59 plaque texture-based features was padded with six wall-based measurement features to show the improvement in stratification accuracy. The ML system was executed using principle component analysis-based framework for dimensionality reduction and uses support vector machine classifier for training and testing-phases. Results The ML system produced a stratification accuracy of 91.28%, demonstrating an improvement of 5.69% when wall-based measurement features were combined with plaque texture-based features. The fused system showed an improvement in mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and area under the curve by: 6.39%, 4.59%, 3.31% and 5.48%, respectively when compared to the stand-alone system.

The introduction of emotions in intelligent systems is required to create systems that are more similar to human beings and thus more reliable. In this paper, the idea of introducing the emotion 'uncertainty' in Intelligent Systems is proposed.

When used individually the classifiers had errors in the range of 6-7% but when combined as the Semi-Automated Intelligent System, the false predictions were kept under 0.2%.

But, most of the crops grown by the farmer are affected by weeds. Weed identification and control remains one of the most challenging tasks in agriculture. The most widely used methods for weed control is manual spraying of herbicides. But, this method has several negative impacts. Since hand labor is costly, an automated weed control system may be economically feasible. Although there have been many efforts to develop a system to control in-row weeds autonomously, no system is currently available for real-time field use. Further, the Onion is slowgrowing, shallow-rooted crop that can suffer severe yield loss from weed competition. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems, the proposed system aims to develop a computer vision based robotic weed control system (WCS) for real-time control of weeds in onion fields. This system will be able to identify weeds and selectively spray right amount of the herbicide. The proposed WCS is an inexpensive and portable wireless system of handheld equipments which can be controlled remotely through a user friendly web interface. It is designed to automate the control of weeds and thus reduces the difficulties of farmers in maintaining the field.

The power industry is not an exception in the technological advancement which makes everything smarter. Smart grid is the advanced version of the traditional grid, which makes the system more efficient and self-healing. Synchrophasor is a device used in smart grids to measure the values of electric waves, voltages and current. The phasor measurement unit produces immense volume of current and voltage data that is used to monitor and control the performance of the grid. These data are huge in size and vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion Detection is a common technique for finding the intrusions in the system. In this paper, a big data framework is designed using various machine learning techniques, and intrusions are detected based on the classifications applied on the synchrophasor dataset. In this approach various machine learning techniques like deep neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, decision trees and naive bayes classifications are done for the synchrophasor dataset and the results are compared using metrics of accuracy, recall, false rate, specificity, and prediction time. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to reduce the prediction time taken by the proposed approach.

However, the quality and outcomes of collaboration depend upon a number of factors, among which group formation plays an important role. Existing approaches take into account groups formed through random assignment or based on certain criteria such as academic performance, demographic features, and communication skills. This paper proposes an approach where preferences of learners in terms of the composition of the group to which they would like to belong are taken into account. Machine learning algorithm (K-Means) is applied to cluster large learner groups and to analyze their preferences. Further, prior knowledge and communication skills of learners are likely to influence effectiveness of collaborative learning. Therefore, these two factors are considered in addition to learner preferences. Initially, groups are formed using learner preferences. Then an attempt is made to include learners with good academic performance and communication skills in each group. Results from this study shows that the proposed approach for group formation enhances learner satisfaction in collaborative learning, which is likely to improve learning outcomes. © 2017 IEEE.",Clustering; Collaborative learning; Group formation; K-means,Learning algorithms; Clustering; Collaborative learning; Communication skills; Demographic features; Group formations; K-means; Learner satisfactions; Learning effectiveness; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Many studies have been carried out in the field of defect prediction for imbalanced datasets but most of them uses SMOTE oversampling method to handle the imbalanced data problem. There are many other oversampling methods which help to deal with imbalancing problem and are still unexplored particularly in the field of software defect prediction. This study develops a tool by implementing three of those unexplored oversampling methods namely ADASYN, SPIDER and Safe-Level-SMOTE. Furthermore, we analyze their performance in comparison to traditional method SMOTE. The performance of oversampling methods is evaluated by applying three machine learning techniques for defect prediction using object oriented metrics. The results are evaluated using two open source defect datasets. The result analysis showed that the prediction error decreased and performance of the machine learning techniques improved when balanced datasets were used with respect to three oversampling methods.

Since software maintainability prediction is a complicated process; estimating maintainability in the prior phases of software development lifecycle (SDLC) is advantageous. Further, it helps in building economical software and improving resource planning well in advance. Software metrics are strongly correlated with software maintainability as they help in examining the structural quality and characteristics of a software. Feature subset selection (FSS) is an important data preprocessing technique used in data mining. It involves determining a subset of notable features for building a prediction model. All software metrics are not equally relevant; hence, using all of them for predicting maintainability will significantly increase time, budget and effort. Thus, to achieve best maintainability prediction results with a particular learning algorithm, it is critical to select the most relevant features that manifest the characteristics of the software in hand which is this study are two open source software - Apache Jackrabbit and Light Weight Java Game Library (LWJGL). Our main focus has been to reduce the number of metrics using an instancebased FSS technique Relief and then use these relevant metrics to predict maintainability. It was observed that Linear Regression algorithm showed maximum increase of approximately 11% in accuracy levels with Relief FSS algorithm for both the open source software datasets.

This new approach provides abstraction of lower-level functionality and allows the network administrators to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior programmatically. The centralized control, being the major advantage of SDN can sometimes also be a major security threat. If the intruder succeeds in attacking the central controller, he would get access to the entire system. The controller is highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which lead to exhaustion of the system resources which causes non-availability of the services given by the controller. It is critical to detect the attacks in the controller at earlier stage. Many algorithms and techniques have been discovered for this purpose. But less work has been done in the field of SDN networks. Using machine learning algorithms for classifying the connections into legitimate and illegitimate is one such solution. We use two machine learning algorithms namely, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and the Neural Network (NN) classifier to detect the suspicious and harmful connections. © 2017 IEEE.",DDoS; Machine learning algorithms; Neural network; SDN; SVM,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Controllers; Denial-of-service attack; Distributed computer systems; Integrated control; Learning systems; Network security; Neural networks; Software defined networking; Support vector machines; Centralized control; DDoS; Distributed denial of service attack; Network administrator; Network behaviors; Neural network (nn); Software defined networking (SDN); System resources; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The deep networks are performed well in comparison to the shallow networks in most of the experiment configurations. The main reason to this might be a deep network passes information through several layers to learn the underlying hidden patterns of normal and attack network connection records and finally aggregates these learned features of each layer together to effectively distinguish the normal and various attacks of network connection records. Additionally, deep networks have not only performed well in detecting and classifying the known attacks additionally in unknown attacks too. To achieve an acceptable detection rate, we used various configurations of network settings and its parameters in deep networks. All the various configurations of deep network are run up to 1000 epochs in training with a learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5] to effectively capture the time varying patterns of normal and various attacks. © 2017 IEEE.",Shallow and Deep networks,Classification (of information); Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Deep networks; Dynamic characteristics; Information and Communication Technologies; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-class classification; Network connection; Network intrusion detection systems; Time-varying patterns; Computer crime,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Closely 80% of the Persons with Epilepsy (PWE) living in little- and middle-income countries. Analysis of epilepsy lies on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through the various behavior of brain disorders. Localizing the seizure points is generally is tedious and time consuming. Therefore one often to acquire and analyze ten or even hundred hours of recordings. Alternative method is to predict the seizure before they occur and allow the patients to take appropriate care. In this paper, EEG signal is decomposed into coefficients by Wavelet transform. Second, state space reconstrunction method is used to derive phase space trajectory by converting time space signal to phase space. Finally, the classification performance is associated by accrucay and training time with fuzzy system and extreme learning machine (ELM) in neural system. The comparative experimental results using publically available data and real time data are comprised to display the efficiency of the suggested work towards the examination of seizure gestures.

This paper attempts to know the effectiveness of various RNN mechanisms on the traffic classification specifically for Secure Shell (SSH) protocol by modeling the feature sets of statistical flows as time-series obtained from various public and private traces. These traces are from NIMS (Network Information Management and Security Group), DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) 1999 Week1, DARPA 1999 Week3, MAWI (Measurement and Analysis on the WIDE Internet), and NLANR (National Laboratory for Applied Network Research) Active Measurement Project (AMP). A various configurations of network topologies, network parameters and network structures are used for family of RNN architectures to identify an optimal architecture. The experiments are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-05] on both the binary and multiclass classification settings. RNN mechanisms have performed well in comparison to the other classical machine learning algorithms. Moreover, long short-term memory (LSTM) mechanism is a modified RNN, as achieved highest accuracy in cross-validation and testing of binary and multi-class classification cases. The background reason to that is, RNN mechanisms have capability to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies by storing information and updating them, when it is necessary across time-steps. © 2017 IEEE.",Deep learning mechanisms; Flow based mechanism; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Recurrent neural network (RNN); SSH; Traffic classification,Brain; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Dynamics; Image processing; Information management; Internet protocols; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Recurrent neural networks; Speech recognition; Telecommunication traffic; Defense advanced research projects agencies; Flow based; Large-scale sequences; Learning mechanism; Measurement and analysis; Multi-class classification; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Traffic classification; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This kind of malware has been growing largely in recent days and causes tens of millions of dollars losses to consumers. In this paper, we evaluate shallow and deep networks for the detection and classification of ransomware. To characterize and distinguish ransomware over benign and various other families of ransomwares, we leverage the dominance of application programming interface (API) invocations. To select a best architecture for the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), we done various experiments related to network parameters and structures. All the experiments are run up to 500 epochs with a learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5]. Result obtained on our data set is more promising to distinguish ransomware not only from benign from its families too. On distinguishing the .EXE as either benign or ransomware, MLP has attained highest accuracy 1.0 and classifying the ransomware to their categories obtained highest accuracy 0.98.

Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder which often goes undiagnosed and leads to serious problems like stroke, heart attacks etc. Conventional diagnosis of sleep apnea is done by continuous recording of physiological signals for 6 to 7 hrs during sleep and then manually marking the events. This process is expensive and not affordable to people in rural areas. In this work we show that detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be automated using machine learning techniques. We used heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory rate variability (RRV) parameters derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory effort signals (RES) respectively as input to the support vector machine (SVM) backend classifier. In a healthy person without apnea, there would be a rhythm in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This rhythm will change in patients with OSA, even when no sleep disorder related events are clinically visible. We use HRV and RRV features as indicators of this rhythm. Based on this, our automated system for OSA detection (ASOSAD) detects OSA without waiting for any events to happen. We used the signals in rapid eye movement (REM) state of the sleep, as the chances of occurrence of apneas are more due to complete loss of muscle tone in REM. The REM state was detected using the chin EMG signal 80% classification accuracy was obtained for the baseline system developed with time domain (TD) and frequency domain (FD) features of HRV and RRV as input. We found 10% absolute improvement in performance while using only the TD HRV features for developing the system. By analyzing the individual TD HRV and TD RRV based systems we found a complementarity in decisions. Subsequently We combined the decisions of the two systems by fusing the scores at the output of each system with weight which is calculated empirically using calibration data. For the fused system we obtained a performance improvement of 10% compared the best individual system, resulting in no error in OSA detection in REM stage. We are also exploring the possibility of developing a sleep stage independent system and the results will be reported in due course of time. © 2017 IEEE.","Biomedical; Heart rate variability; OSA detection; Respiratory rate variability,e health care; Sleep apnea; SVM",Automation; Biomedical signal processing; Diagnosis; Electrocardiography; Eye movements; Frequency domain analysis; Health care; Heart; Learning systems; Rural areas; Support vector machines; Time domain analysis; Autonomic nervous system; Biomedical; Heart rate variability; Machine learning techniques; Obstructive sleep apnea; Performance improvements; Respiratory rate; Sleep apnea; Sleep research,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Climate forecasting has a highly relevant effect in agricultural fields and industries sectors. The process of predicting climate conditions is required for different areas of life sectors. Handling missing data is significant because a lot of machine learning algorithms performance are affected by missing values in addition, they do not support data with missing values. Various techniques have been used to process missing data problem and the most applied is removing any row that contains at least one missing value. Also, another approaches to solve missing data problems are to impute the missing data to yield a more complete dataset. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction with the climate data, missing value from dataset should be removed or imputed/predicted in the pre-processing phase before using the data for prediction or clustering in the analysis step. In this paper, we propose a new technique to handle missing values in weather data using machine learning algorithms by execute experiments with NCDC dataset to evaluate the prediction error of five methods namely the kernel ridge, linear regression, random forest, SVM imputation and KNN imputation procedure. The missing values were imputed using each method and compared to the observed value.

Any attempt of developing the system dealing with the fish disease diagnosis and to overcome various difficulties is in it has still not met any extra ordinary success. Identification of diseased fish at early stage is necessary step to prevent from spreading disease. This paper recognizes and identifies the EUS (Epizootic Ulcerative syndrome) disease which is caused by bn Aphanomyces invadans, a fungal pathogen. It is a red spot disease and looks like ulcer hence it is generally misidentified by the people. The paper is divided into two parts, in the first part segmentation has been applied to enhance the image, various edge detection techniques have applied to get the useful information and Morphological operations have been applied on the EUS diseased fish image. In second part features are extracted from the EUS infected fish image through different feature Descriptors i.e. HOG (Histogram of Gradient),FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and classify the EUS infected and Non-EUS infected fish image through Machine Learning Algorithms and find the classification accuracy through Classifier. If PCA applied after feature extraction then it increases the accuracy as it is a dimensional reduction. The proposed combination of techniques gives better accuracy as compared to the others.

This research aims to combine color information from RGBD with motion information from skeletal joints in order to capture subtle motions in the video which in used to tackle temporal features extraction. The researchers show this by using combined deep architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoders (SAE). In this model CNN is used to learn motion representations from Motion History Images (MHIs) of sampled RGB image frames. Whereas SAE is used to learn discriminative movements of human skeletal joints by taking the distances of joints from mean joint at each sampled frame. The proposed model is able to learn low level abstractions of joint motion sequences as well as how motion changes with location of image in each MHI frame. Both deep architectures were trained separately by averaging the Softmax class posteriors across the sampled frames to obtain score of the video clip. Normalize class scores of each of the networks in [0,1] range and perform late fusion by taking weighted mean of class scores based on relative performances of the two networks. The proposed model is evaluated on standard action recognition benchmarks of MSR Daily Activity3D and MSR Action3D datasets, where the proposed architecture has improved recognition accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",Combined deep architecture; Convolutional neural netwok; Late fusion; MHI; Stacked auto-encoders,Convolution; Image recognition; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Auto encoders; Convolutional neural netwok; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Deep architectures; Human activity recognition; Late fusion; Motion history images; Proposed architectures; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Most of the solutions to the FSP are designed and proposed as a preprocessing step wherein the best suited features are selected in an off-line manner. Online feature selection is a much more complex problem. This paper describes a novel Immuno-inspired Online Feature Selection (iFS) approach to select the best suited features for a domain. The approach uses an Immune Network as a base to realize an autonomous and self-learning solution to online FSP. Unlike conventional methods this approach does not rely on a fixed set of predefined training data. Instead, given a set of features (antibodies) it responds to incoming data (antigens) and delivers a reduced set of the former. The efficacy of the proposed method has been justified based on experiments carried out to classify human beings from non-human ones. Comparisons with three widely used methods also authenticate the superiority of the approach. © 2017 IEEE.",,Cybernetics; Learning systems; Complex problems; Conventional methods; Feature selection problem; Immune network; Online feature selection; Pre-processing step; Self-learning; Training data; Feature extraction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The research on automation raises a fundamental question: Can machines learn to act & behave like humans? Safe & efficient robot-human interaction - known as 'collaborative robotics' or 'cobotics' - has the power to transform production & assembly lines. The probability of industrial mishaps involving robots (like that in SKH metals, Manesar, August 2015) has increased with time. Companies using robots have burgeoned more safety programmes but they have some drawbacks. A real-time, MEMS sensor (PZT material) based, economical approach is proposed ensuring the safety in robotic workspace by shutting the robot system off or slowing it down upon human entry. During operation if a fault is detected at the robotic arm, the cabin operator is informed through the Human Machine Interface (HMI). The Arduino trips the robot when the operator steps on the piezoelectric mat (Doormat) while entering the workspace. The conventional safety switch can be bypassed since it is manual & sometimes problematic where fast response troubleshooting action is required but our proposed design has relatively less failure rate than traditional one. The unification of Arduino UNO & Relay, based on 'OR' logic protects the personnel from any unexpected robotic behaviour even when he fails to trigger the safety switch. The status of the robotic arm can be monitored distantly by IOT integration. It is programmed with a calculated threshold value of the foot pressure corresponding to 60 Kg of body mass for the circuit tripping to avoid false triggering. As this operation is part of a process plant, operators can increase the speed of other similar processes in the unit to compensate for the loss of production. © 2017 IEEE.",Arduino UNO; Automation; Human Machine Interface (HMI); Human-robot interaction; IOT(Internet of Things); Piezo sensor; Protection,Accident prevention; Automation; Computer circuits; Failure analysis; Human computer interaction; Industrial robots; Internet of things; Learning systems; Man machine systems; Robotic arms; Robotics; Robots; Arduino UNO; False triggering; Human Machine Interface; Piezosensors; Protection; Robot-human interaction; Robotic workspace; Threshold-value; Human robot interaction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

But some of the classifier techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is not able to handle the huge amount of data due to it's excessive memory requirement and unreasonable complexity in algorithm tough it is one of the most popularly used classifier in machine learning field. Hence a new technique comes into picture which performs parallel algorithm in a efficient way to work data having large scale called as PSVM.

The essence of this paper is to analyze the textual content of the message and user typing behavior to build a classifier that efficiently classifies the future instances. Each observation in the data set consists of 14 features. A machine learning technique called Naive Bayes classifier is applied to construct the classifier.

Hence, intelligent predictor has been developed and reported which is suitable for nonlinear time series. But such predictors require that the past financial data are available at the location of the predictor which is not the case in many real-life situations. Hence, when the financial data are available at different places and a single intelligent predictor needs to be developed, the task becomes challenging. In the current work, this problem has been addressed and solved using a low-complexity artificial neural network and employing incremental and diffusion learning strategies. In the current study, distributed prediction of three different types of time series such as exchange rates, stock indices and net asset values has been carried using incremental and diffusion-based learning strategies. The results of different days ahead prediction of two proposed low computational complexity-based functional link artificial neural network are compared with those obtained by conventional intelligent method.

Due to absence of any in-built authentication, the protocol is vulnerable to a class of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, popularly known as DHCP starvation attacks. However, known DHCP starvation attacks are either ineffective in wireless networks or not stealthy in some of the network topologies. In this paper, we first propose a stealth DHCP starvation attack which is effective in both wired and wireless networks and can not be detected by known detection mechanisms. We test the effectiveness of proposed attack in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and show that it can successfully prevent other clients from obtaining IP address, thereby, causing DoS scenario. In order to detect the proposed attack, we also propose a Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection framework. In particular, we use some popular one-class classifiers for the detection purpose. We capture IPv4 and IPv6 traffic from a real network with thousands of devices and evaluate the detection capability of different machine learning algorithms.

The rise in popularity of asynchronous video based job interviews has created the need for a scalable solution to gauge candidate performance and hence we turn to automation. In this research, we aim to build a system that automatically provides a summative feedback to candidates at the end of an interview. Most feedback system predicts values of social indicators and communication cues, leaving the interpretation open to the user. Our system directly predicts an actionable feedback that leaves the candidate with a tangible take away at the end of the interview.We approached placement trainers and made a list of most common feedback that is given during training and we attempt to predict them directly. Towards this front,we captured data from over 145 participants in an interview like environment. Designing intelligent training environments for job interview preparation using a video data corpus is a demanding task due to its complex correlations and multimodal interactions.

Measuring or analyzing the engagement of students is very important to improve learning as well as teaching. In this work, we analyze the engagement or attention level of the students from their facial expressions, headpose and eye gaze using computer vision techniques and a decision is taken using machine learning algorithms. Since the human observers are able to well distinguish the attention level from student's facial expressions,head pose and eye gaze, we assume that machine will also be able to learn the behavior automatically. The engagement level is analyzed on 10 second video clips. The performance of the algorithm is better than the baseline results. Our best accuracy results are 10 % better than the baseline.

However, spectrum bandwidth and time delay constraints limit the explicit sharing of these parameters and hence, they need to be estimated blindly. Though significant work has been done in blind parameter estimation, the task becomes non-trivial when reconfigurable terminals employ sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) for wideband signal digitization. The proposed work presents the SNS and blind reconstruction based automatic modulation classifier (AMC) to blindly identify the modulation scheme of wideband multi-carrier signal, e.g. OFDM waveform.

There are various approaches available to detect phishing attack, e.g., blacklist, machine learning, visual similarity, etc. However, most of these approaches have various limitations, as they are complicated, produce high false positive rate, language dependent, slow in nature, and not fit for the real-time environment. In this paper, we present a two-level authentication approach, which not only detects phishing attacks accurately in real time environment but also does not depend on the textual language of the webpage. Proposed approach execute two authentications before declaring a webpage as phishing, which makes it more accurate, reliable, and fast. In the first level authentication, the search engine based mechanism is proposed which use a simple, reliable and language independent query to authenticate the webpage. The second level authentication processes different hyperlinks within the source code of the webpage for the detection of phishing webpages. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated, and it achieved the significantly higher true negative rate of 99.95%.

This fact is more important in diseases like thyroid, which is very difficult to detect as its symptoms coincide with several diseases. Usage of machine learning algorithms for thyroid disease diagnosis is prominent. A typical thyroid disease diagnosis system uses three main steps, namely, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the use of filter-based (F-Score) and wrapper-based (Recursive Feature Elimination) feature selection algorithms on its effect on disease identification and classification. The analysis is also performed with Principle Component Analysis dimensionality reduction algorithms. Performance evaluation was performed with three metrics, namely, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Four classifiers, namely, MultiLayer Perceptron, Back Propagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Extreme Learning Machine were used to analyze the selected algorithms.

In most of the approaches, the SR corresponding to speech signal is estimated using a dictionary, which could be either exemplar based or learned. However, a single-level decomposition may not be suitable for the speech signal, as it contains complex hierarchical information about various hidden attributes. In this paper, we propose to use a multilevel decomposition (having multiple layers), also known as the deep sparse representation (DSR), to derive a feature representation for speech recognition. Instead of having a series of sparse layers, the proposed framework employs a dense layer between two sparse layers, which helps in efficient implementation. Our studies reveal that the representations obtained at different sparse layers of the proposed DSR model have complimentary information. Thus, the final feature representation is derived after concatenating the representations obtained at the sparse layers. This results in a more discriminative representation, and improves the speech recognition performance. Since the concatenation results in a high-dimensional feature, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of the obtained feature. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed feature outperforms existing features for various speech recognition tasks. © 2014 IEEE.",Deep sparse representation (DSR); dictionary learning; speech recognition,Data structures; Glossaries; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Speech; Speech communication; Speech processing; Dictionary learning; Efficient implementation; Feature representation; Hierarchical information; High dimensional feature; Multiple layers; Sparse representation; Speech recognition performance; Speech recognition,"Sharma, P.; Multimedia Analytics and Systems Lab., School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MandiIndia; email: pulkit_s@students.iitmandi.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23299290,,,,English,IEEE ACM Trans.

In the past, conventional methods such as output error method, filter error method, equation error method and non-conventional method such as artificial neural-network based methods have been used for aircraft's aerodynamic parameter estimation. Nowadays, a trend of finding an accurate nonlinear function approximation is required to represent the aircraft's equations-of-motion. Such type of nonlinear function approximation is usually achieved using artificial neural-network which is trained with the aircraft input-output flight data using a training algorithm. The accuracy of estimated parameters, which is achieved using the trained network, is highly dependent on the generalisation capability of the network which can be improved using extreme learning machine based network in contrast to artificial neural-network. To estimate the unstable aircraft parameters from the simulated flight data, Gauss-Newton based optimisation method has been used with a predefined aerodynamic model using the trained network. Further, the confidence of the estimated parameters has been shown in comparison to that of the standard parameter estimation methods in terms of the Cramer-Rao bounds. © 2017 DESIDOC.",Extreme learning machine; Gauss-Newton method; Parameter estimation; Unstable aircraft,Aerodynamics; Aircraft; Approximation algorithms; Cramer-Rao bounds; Equations of motion; Errors; Fighter aircraft; Functions; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Newton-Raphson method; Nonlinear equations; Training aircraft; Aerodynamic parameter estimations; Equation error method; Extreme learning machine; Gauss-Newton methods; Non-conventional methods; Nonlinear function approximation; Parameter estimation method; Simulated flight data; Parameter estimation,,,Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre,0011748X,,DSJOA,,English,Def.

Several attempts to secure 802.11 standard ends up with the inadequate security mechanisms that are vulnerable to various attacks and intrusions. Thus, integration of external defense mechanism like intrusion detection system (IDS) is inevitable. An anomaly-based IDS employs machine learning algorithms to detect attacks. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensure the performance of the classifier in terms of speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability. This paper proposes a normalized gain based IDS for MAC Intrusions (NMI) to improve the IDS performance significantly. The proposed NMI includes two primary components OFSNP and DCMI. The first component is optimal feature selection using NG and PSO (OFSNP) and the second component is Detecting and Categorizing MAC 802.11 Intrusions (DCMI) using SVM classifier. The OFSNP ranks the features using an independent measure as normalized gain (NG) and selects the optimal set of features using semi-supervised clustering (SSC). The SSC is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that uses labeled and unlabeled features simultaneously to find a group of optimal features. Using the optimal set of features, the proposed DCMI utilizes a rapid and straightforward support vector machine (SVM) learning that classifies the attacks under the appropriate classes. Thus, the proposed NMI achieves a better trade-off between detection accuracy and learning time. The experimental results show that the NMI accurately detects and classifies the 802.11 specific intrusions and also, it reduces the false positives and computation complexity by decreasing the number of features. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Intrusion detection system; MAC 802.11; Normalized gain (NG); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machine (SVM) classifier; WLAN,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Computation complexity; Intrusion Detection Systems; MAC 802.11; Normalized gains; Optimal feature selections; Semi-supervised Clustering; WLAN; Feature extraction,"Kavitha, P.; Department of Information Technology, Adhiyamaan College of EngineeringIndia; email: kavitha.it@adhiyamaan.in",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969850606

In the big data era, we are facing a diversity of datasets from different sources in different domains. These datasets consist of multiple modalities, each of which has a different representation, distribution, scale and density. Big data have volumes in range Exabyte's ten to the power of eighteen. A large number of data's are stored in Big Data storage every second. For instance in YouTube for every second a video of size 72 hours are being uploaded. It shows that big data have a big scope in handling of large data. Big data for learning, intelligence, data fusion, social network, mining and so many plays a vital role in it. The big data technologies along with machine learning algorithm have developed lots of advanced development in the field of social mining, network and social Medias. It has also developed so many challenges in data storage, handling, representation, mining, analysing the user behaviours and so many. In Social mining along with text the symbols are also analysed for effective mining of users. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems. The data storage size can be optimized by using the map reduce algorithm in a effective way for data storage in big data. When the repeateddata's are replaced with its reference then the storage will be optimized.

Efforts are being made to tackle this problem as agriculture is an important aspect of our economy. Due to diseases, a major part of crops produced is lost every year. This is due to lack of expertise among the farmers, failing to detect and diagnose the disease correctly in time or due to commencement of control measure in late. To prevent crop loss, image processing for diagnosis of disease symptom using soft computing techniques is a need of modern day agriculture. In this study, initial focus was paid towards automatic identification of leaves between okra and bitter gourd from the images. To diagnose disease symptom from leaf images, forty-three morphological features of leaves of both the crops were chosen. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient technique was exercised to set key identifying features depending on a particular type of leaf image. Ten key morphological features of okra leaf and nine key morphological features of bitter gourd leaf were selected for the purpose. The proposed technique was experimented on 79 and 75 okra and bitter gourd leaf images, respectively. Finally Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (YVMV) disease gradation was done based on entropy based binning and Naive Bayes classifier.

An outlier could be the key discovery to be made from large datasets and the insights gathered from them could be of significance in a wide variety of domains like information security, business intelligence, clinical decision support, financial monitoring etc. Recently, Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) driven approaches are shown as having good predictive accuracy. This paper proposes a novel low-complexity anomaly detection algorithm based on Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). The proposed algorithm reduces the complexity by avoiding the calculation of Lagrange multipliers of an objective function, instead locates an approximate pre-image of the SVDD sphere's center, within the input space itself. The crux of the training algorithm is a gradient descent of the primal objective function using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA).

Here, we performed the location-wise analysis of the campaign and predict the degree of polarity of tweets along with the monthly and weekly analysis of the tweets. The experiments were conducted in five phases namely extraction and preprocessing of tweets, tokenization, sentiment evaluation of a line, sentiment evaluation of a blog (document) and analysis. Our tool is also capable of handling transliterated words.

HMNNA consists of three neural networks trained specifically on different areas of problem space under consideration, and the trained networks are then arranged in a tree structure forming hierarchical modular neural network architecture. The three specialized neural networks are trained by Levenberg–Maarquardt neural network algorithm. As compared to the standard back propagation algorithm, Levenberg–Maarquardt is fast and stable for convergence with only one drawback, i.e., storage requirement for estimated Hessian Matrix. For training and testing of HMNNA, a huge primary database is created which contains 8091 cervical cell images pertaining to 200 clinical cases collected from two health care institutions of northern India. The raw cases of cervical cancer in the form of Pap smear slides were photographed under a multi-headed digital microscope. Individual cells were manually cropped off from these slide images which were then passed through a feature extraction module for morphological profiling. Each cell was calibrated on the basis of 40 features from both cytoplasm and nucleus. After profiling, these cells were vigilantly assigned cell classes as per the latest 2001-Bethesda system of cervical cancer cell classification, by trained cytotechnicians and histopathologists. HMNNA is also trained and tested on the Herlev Benchmark dataset created by the Denmark University, which consists of 1417 cervical cancer cells. Both the datasets have seven classes of diagnosis, i.e., superficial squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ, corresponding to the level of abnormality in cervical cells. These datasets are available in public domain at http://digitalpapsmeardb.in/and http://mde-lab.aegean.gr/index.php/downloads.The screening potential of the HMNNA is compared with 25 well-known machine learning algorithms available in MatlabR2016 (Machine learning and statistics toolbox 10.2) and monolithic neural network algorithms available in Matlab neural network pattern recognition toolbox. The HMNNA outperformed in all the 25 algorithms for both the datasets. For the Novel Benchmark database, it produced a classification accuracy of 95.32% with an F-value of 0.949310 and classification accuracy of 88.41% with an F-value of 0.89145 for the Herlev dataset. The screening potential of HMNNA was also evaluated and compared with the other diagnostic systems available in the recently published literature and was found to be performing much better than the counterparts on multiple parameters of performance evaluation. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Cervical cancer; Machine learning; Modular neural networks; Neural networks; Pap smear test,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Cells; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Cytology; Database systems; Digital devices; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Trees (mathematics); Cervical cancer cells; Cervical cancers; Classification accuracy; Modular neural networks; Neural network algorithm; Pap smear; Standard back propagation algorithms; Storage requirements; Network architecture,"Ali, M.; Department of Computer Science and IT, University of JammuIndia; email: mehbobaali@gmail.com",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

To achieve the best possible performance within limited power budgets, the various system resources need to be allocated effectively. Any mismatch between runtime resource requirement and allocation leads to a sub-optimal energy-delay product (EDP). Different optimization techniques exist for addressing the problem of mismatch between the dynamic requirement and runtime allocation of the system resources. Choosing between multiple optimizations at runtime is complex due to the non-additive effects, making the scenario suitable for the application of machine learning techniques. We present a novel method,Machine LearnedMachines (MLM), by using online reinforcement learning (RL) to perform dynamic partitioning of the last level cache (LLC), along with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) of the core and uncore (interconnection network and LLC). We have proposed and evaluated three different MLM co-optimization techniques based on independent and cooperative multi-agent learners. We show that the co-optimization results in a much lower system EDP than any of the techniques applied individually. We explore various RL models targeted toward optimization of different system metrics and study their effects on a system EDP, system throughput (STP), and Fairness. The various proposed techniques have been extensively evaluated with a mix of 20 workloads on a 4-core system using Spec2006 benchmarks.We have further evaluated our cooperative MLM techniques on a 16-core system.

The classification using the different machine learning technique leads for over fitting and under fitting. To select the optimized feature is a difficult task. The high dimension feature vector requires a high computational cost. The hand craft feature selection machine learning techniques performed poor. We have used the incremental feature selection strategy for feature selection. In this paper we first selected the feature and identify the principle feature then we classify gait data using different machine learning technique (KNN, ANN, SVM, DNN and classifier fusion) and shown the performance comparison. Experimental result on real time datasets propose method is better than previous method as far as humanoid locomotion classification is concerned and the generalization accuracy provided by new feature selection method i.e. incremental feature selection (IFS) with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Zhang et al., 20). During the feature extraction, 17 features were selected from the existing literatures (Wang et al. in IEEE Trans Circ Syst Video Technol 14(2):149–158, 15). Using all the features could lead to over fitting, information redundancy and dimension disaster. Thus, a system with optimal features was selected using ANOVA combined with IFA. These selected features were then fed as an input to the ANN, SVM, KNN and DNN model. These individual classifiers were combined to produce classifier fusion model. The 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Based on the empirical results it may be concluded that classifier fusion provides satisfactory results (92.23 %) compared to other individual classifiers. One-way analysis of variance test, Friedman’s test and Kruskal-Wallis test has also been conducted to validate the statistical significance of the results. The proposed system can be used as recommender system based on behavioral gait pattern about the performance of player of Indian cricket team, Biometric and help to diagnosis Parkinson disease. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Biometric identification; Bipedal locomotion; Feature selection; Gait; Incremental feature selection (IFA),Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Diagnosis; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Biometric identifications; Bipedal locomotion; Feature selection methods; Gait; Incremental feature selection (IFA); Information redundancies; Machine learning techniques; Statistical significance; Classification (of information),"Semwal, V.B.; Indian Institute of Information Technology DharwadIndia; email: vsemwal@iiitdwd.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000977780

It is one of the most widely spread cancer among women. As per the survey, one out of eight women in the world are at risk of breast cancer at some point of time in her life. One of the methods to reduce breast cancer mortality rate is timely detection and effective treatment. That is why, more accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor has become a challenging problem in the medical field. Many classification techniques are proposed in the literature. Today, expert systems and machine learning techniques are being extensively used in the breast cancer classification problem. They provide high classification accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities. In this paper, we have proposed a novel Gauss-Newton representation based algorithm (GNRBA) for breast cancer classification. It uses the sparse representation with training sample selection. Until now, sparse representation has been successfully applied in pattern recognition only. The proposed method introduces a novel Gauss-Newton based approach to find the optimal weights for the training samples for classification. In addition, it evaluates the sparsity in a computationally efficient way as compared to the conventional l1-norm method. The effectiveness of the GNRBA is examined on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) and the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) database from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Various performance measures like classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrices, a statistical test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) are reported to show the superiority of the proposed method as compared to classical models. The experimental results show that the proposed GNRBA could be a good alternative for breast cancer classification for clinical experts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Breast cancer classification; Euclidean distance measure; Gauss-Newton representation based algorithm; Sparse representation,Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Gaussian distribution; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Sampling; Breast cancer classifications; Euclidean distance measure; Gauss Newton; Gauss-Newton based approach; Machine learning techniques; Receiver operating characteristics; Sparse representation; UCI machine learning repository; Diseases,"Panda, R.; Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, VSSUTIndia; email: r_ppanda@yahoo.co.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019364170

In case of high-end priced products, the demand is seasonal and sensitive. The investment involves high risk and revenues vary beyond fathomable bounds. The primary objective of this research is to present a decision-support system for retail pricing and revenue optimization of these retail products. The sales data of past 2.5 years from prominent retail stores across 45 different regions has been used to develop this study. A regression tree/random forest-based machine learning algorithm is used to predict weekly demand. It incorporates price, holidays, discounts, inventory and other regional factors in decision making. Following this, the demand-price interdependencies are quantified and integrated into an integer linear programming model for optimal price allocation. This methodology has been implemented on offline retailing of expensive products which generally follow high variation in demand. The expected revenue has been optimized by branch & bound and branch & cut method, followed by root node analysis. The solution is further optimized by heuristic methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Analytics; Assignment; Branch and bound; Data mining; Integer programming; Retailing,Artificial intelligence; Costs; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Retail stores; Sales; Analytics; Assignment; Demand prediction; Expensive products; Integer linear programming models; Primary objective; Retailing; Revenue optimization; Branch and bound method,"Zhang, J.H.; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jinan University (Zhuhai Campus)China; email: zhangjianghua@sdu.edu.cn",,Elsevier Ltd,3608352,,CINDD,,English,Comput Ind Eng,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029546623

Wavelet transform is used to extract the signal properties-skewness, kurtosis and entropy and Fourier Transform is used to extract the energy of the signal. For training the data set which consists of basically 9 classes, two algorithms are used: Bayesian Regularization algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The corresponding networks are made using training set and then these networks are used to classify the test set. Efficiency of the two algorithms is calculated to find out which is the more suitable one.

Business transaction processing systems lack ease of usability and acceptability among those who work on defining transactions for business processes. The major reason behind this is the difficulty in understanding the business processing framework provided by these systems and the adept programming skills required to work on them. Thus new challenges and barriers seem to come up in this area. This work tries to overcome this problem, by introducing a domain specific language called XBRL which brings down the level of programming knowledge required to work on business transaction systems. This can help the the business domain experts in implementing complex business transactions without learning complex programming languages. The XBRL language is developed using Eclipse Framework Xtext and programming language Xtend. This framework gives better efficiency than any general purpose language in terms of complexity of programming. It also provides a set of features like domain specific content-assist, validator and quickfix suggestions. The XBRL language can be easily extended for using in newer domains like big data processing and machine learning, which can enable business transaction processing systems to handle transactions involving huge volumes of data.

With increasing volume and velocity of data handled by these applications, known as the bigdata problem, traditional recommendation systems that analyze data and update models at regular time intervals would not be able to satisfy this requirement. With the evolution of technologies for processing bigdata in real time, it has become fairly easy to implement real time recommendation systems. Stream-computing is a new computing paradigm for handling the velocity attribute of bigdata which makes it possible to develop real time bigdata applications. This paper gives the details of implementation of a real time recommendation system using Apache Spark, a widely used platform for stream computing. This system is implemented for recommending TV channels to viewers in real time. This becomes a challenging task due to continuous changes in the set of available channels and the context dependent preference of viewers. In channel recommendation scenario, characterized by its dynamic nature, volume of data, and tight time constraints, traditional approaches cannot be used. We have implemented a highly scalable TV channel recommendation system optimized for the processing of real-time data streams originating from set-top boxes. The proposed system implements a self-adaptive approach for model building. The system effectively uses distributed processing power of Apache Spark to make recommendations in real time with scalability to meet the real time constraints with increasing load. The Spark Machine Learning Libraries (Spark MLLib) provide several algorithms which were used for developing the proposed recommendation system. The large amount of data in the system is efficiently managed by the data processing method of Lambda Architecture. © 2017 IEEE.",Machine Learning; Real-Time Recommendation Engine; Spark Streaming,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Food products; Learning systems; Libraries; Real time systems; Set-top boxes; Signal processing; Data processing methods; Distributed processing; Evolution of technology; Real time; Real time constraints; Real-time data streams; Self adaptive approach; Traditional approaches; Recommender systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

A machine learning based approach is proposed for the video streaming with DASH (Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP) as an underlying architecture to help client adapt to the changing streaming environment. The reason for using machine learning for adaptation is to make client learn about the environment that too in unsupervised manner. This way the redundant work of adaptation for similar network signatures is eliminated, therefore running time complexity is reduced. The results of our work showed improved QoE and efficient bandwidth utilization, (upto 68.5%), compared with the already present DASH algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Accumulation ratio; DASH; HTTP; QoE,Artificial intelligence; Communication channels (information theory); HTTP; Learning algorithms; Quality of service; Video streaming; Accumulation ratio; DASH; Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP; Efficient bandwidth; Quality of experience (QoE); Rate adaptation; Resource utilizations; Running time; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Recently, numerous HIL systems are in practice for simulating the vehicle networks in real time, by providing necessary signals based on the test cases. There are many approaches to tap the signal from the instrument cluster before it gets displayed, and based on the test case the signal that is captured will be compared with the expected value. The current approaches deal only at the software level and fails in identifying the faults in the end display unit of cluster. The proposed method uses vision based machine learning system to monitor the cluster visually thereby identifying faults in cluster at the end product level.

In recent years, plant species recognition is carried out based on the shape, geometry and texture of various plant parts such as leaves, stem, flowers etc. Flower based plant species identification systems are widely used. While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy. Images of the plant species are acquired using the built-in camera module of a mobile phone. Feature extraction of flower images is performed using a Transfer Learning approach (i.e. extraction of complex features from a pre-trained network). A machine learning classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest is used on top of it to yield a higher accuracy rate. This approach helps in minimizing the hardware requirement needed to perform the computationally intensive task of training a CNN. It is observed that, CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach as feature extractor outperforms all the handcrafted feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Color Channel Statistics, Color Histograms, Haralick Texture, Hu Moments and Zernike Moments. CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach yields impressive Rank-1 accuracies of 73.05%, 93.41% and 90.60% using OverFeat, Inception-v3 and Xception architectures, respectively as Feature Extractors on FLOWERS102 dataset. © 2017 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Flower Recognition; Transfer Learning,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Convolution; Decision trees; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Signal processing; Tellurium compounds; Automatic identification; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction methods; Flower recognition; Plant species identification; Species recognition systems; Transfer learning; Search engines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is primarily used for finding patterns that are validated through statistical methods, in the context of brain connectivity. Quantification of functional connectivity is usually performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Many Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have used PCC to quantify functional connectivity in a bivalent sense. However, the interpretation of negative fMRI responses or deactivation has proved challenging. Therefore, few have employed the absolute value of PCC (univalent) to model functional connectivity. This paper compares the two measures and assesses their performance and suitability for fMRI connectivity modeling. Connectivity analysis and classification of autistic individuals from control population is performed using these two measures. Machine learning classification is employed to quantify the predictive abilities of univalent and bivalent functional connectivity measures. This paper experimentally finds the usage of bivalent measure to be producing better classification accuracy by around 2%, which means it is more suitable for fMRI functional connectivity analysis. © 2017 IEEE.",Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; machine learning; Pearson' scorrelation coefficient,Artificial intelligence; Brain; Correlation methods; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Stochastic systems; Classification accuracy; Connectivity analysis; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Machine learning classification; Pearson' scorrelation coefficient; Pearson's correlation coefficients; Predictive abilities; Signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

But, traditional methods based one-class classifiers are very time consuming due to its iterative process and various parameters tuning. In this paper, we present six OCC methods and their thirteen variants based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and online sequential ELM (OSELM). Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction based and boundary based, where three proposed classifiers belong to reconstruction based and three belong to boundary based. We are presenting both types of learning viz., online and offline learning for OCC. Out of six methods, four are offline and remaining two are online methods. Out of four offline methods, two methods perform random feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. We present a comprehensive discussion on these methods and their comparison to each other. Kernel feature mapping based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of one-class classifiers is tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a crucial factor in case of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been employed so far and analyze the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial datasets to check their boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from different discipline to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our proposed classifiers exhibit better performance compared to ten traditional one-class classifiers and ELM based two one-class classifiers. Through proposed one-class classifiers, we intend to expand the functionality of the most used toolbox for OCC i.e. DD toolbox.

In this work, human femur radiographic bone images are classified using morphometric features derived from the segmented bone. Femur bone structure from 2D X-ray radiograph is segmented using active contour method and morphometric measurements such as head diameter, head height, neck diameter, intertrochanteric distance, proximal femur length and neck length are calculated in pixel values. From the measured morphometric distances, six morphometric ratios are calculated. These ratios are examined to discriminate normal and abnormal bone and used for classification. Neural network based statistical tools such as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Evolutionary Extreme Learning Machine (E-ELM) are utilized to automate the classification. The results show that the E-ELM classifier performance in terms of accuracy (98%) is higher when compared to ELM classifier.

Generally, in large conversational dataset like Twitter it is very difficult to identifying public health-related topics. Machine learning is the area which helps us to overcome this situation. By applying probabilistic unsupervised machine learning we have identified latent topics from the text corpora. Topic modeling algorithms are probabilistic generative models which is used to analyze the words of the original texts to identify themes that run through them, how connected to each other by themes, and how the topics change over (Blei in Commun ACM 55(4):77–84, 2012).

This multimodal content contains information on various issues such as terrorism, child pornography, product reviews and much more. Censoring on-line data that promotes unethical activities globally cannot be done manually. This has generated the need for a tool which can automatically determine the central idea expressed in the video and also categorize it into different emotion labels. When classifying audio video content into different class labels, audio-visual features are highly interdependent. Naive Bayes classification model fails to classify them correctly. In this paper, we propose and have implemented, in the form of a web interface, a novel approach for performing efficient multimodal sentiment analysis of online videos using machine learning algorithm - Perplexed Bayes classification technique, which takes care of the inter-dependency among the features. The interface displays the emotion label - happy, sad or neutral depending on the content of the video, the degree of emotion and the keywords related to the uploaded video.

In a Hidden Markov model-Deep neural network (HMMDNN) based speech recognition system, DNNs have been employed to model senones (context dependent states of HMM), where HMMs capture the temporal relations among senones. Due to the use of more deeper networks significant improvement in the performances has been observed and developing deep learning methods to train more deeper architectures has gained a lot of scientific interest. Optimizing a deeper network is more complex task than to optimize a less deeper network, but recently residual network have exhibited a capability to train a very deep neural network architectures and are not prone to vanishing/exploding gradient problems. In this work, the effectiveness of residual networks have been explored for of speech recognition. Along with the depth of the residual network, the criticality of width of the residual network has also been studied. It has been observed that at higher depth, width of the networks is also a crucial parameter for attaining significant improvements. A 14-hour subset of WSJ corpus is used for training the speech recognition systems, it has been observed that the residual networks have shown much ease in convergence even with a depth much higher than the deep neural network.

Considered as one of the most common neurological disorders, Epilepsy affects people of all ages. Around 65 Million people across the world suffer from this disease. Manual diagnosis of EEG signals of long duration may be a source of error as well as a cumbersome task. Hence automation in Seizure Detection is essential for diagnosis of Epilepsy. Therefore, in this paper, an expert system for EEG signal classification has been proposed. The proposed system aims at classifying EEG signals into 3 classes-Normal, inter-ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during non-seizure period) and ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during seizure period). Discrete Wavelet Transform, a technique for analyzing signals in time-frequency domain has been quite successful in this respect for extraction of features from EEG signals. Further Envelope Analysis has been used on the DWT coefficients before feature extraction in order to elevate the performance of the system. Finally several Machine Learning techniques (E.g: MLP and Random Forest) have been used for classification of the EEG signals and the relative accuracy of these Classifiers with regard to this problem have been compared. The results from the experiments show that the Random Forest Classifier is the most effective classifier for this problem delivering an accuracy of 98%.

Better overall network performance could be achieved only if the network is capable of prioritizing the flows and assign resources based on their application specific requirement. Our proposed, AMPS controller is capable of prioritizing each of the flow using MLT, and assign a path based on its classified priority. AMPS controller supports routing flows through different path even if the flows are between the same pair of nodes. The path finding algorithm employs Yen-K-shortest path algorithm, also it supports scalable flow routing for a large volume of flows. We have implemented the flow routing algorithm in OpenvSwitch as a proof of concept.

Epilepsy can be detected from Electroencephalogram (EEG) as EEG captures and presents the electrical activity of the brain. Non-invasive EEG or scalp EEG is generally used where electrodes are placed on the scalp in order to record the brain activity. In this work a unsupervised machine learning technique is explored which is used to cluster and extract features from EEG recordings (noninvasive) to detect seizures. A patient specific approach is adopted on an open dataset (Physionet database) from where 51 seizure and 51 non seizure recordings of pediatric subjects (age ranging from lyrs to 12yrs) are considered for the related work. Unsupervised algorithm used here is the k-means algorithm to cluster the recordings into two distinct clusters of seizure and non-seizure data. When the performance of the algorithm was tested the algorithm worked with 91.43% accuracy from nearly 18, 00, 000 data taken from various subject. In future scope of work the accuracy of the method can be enhanced using appropriate features for distinctly identifying different intractable seizures according to their characteristics that are prevalent among pediatric patients. © 2017 IEEE.",EEG; Epilepsy; k-means; siezure; Unsupervised learning,Brain; Electroencephalography; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nanotechnology; Neurology; Pediatrics; Unsupervised learning; Electrical activities; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; K-means; Neurological disorders; siezure; Unsupervised algorithms; Unsupervised machine learning; Clustering algorithms,,Taki G.S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Apart from the planting multiple tea varieties, growth of natural vegetation species is common scenario in plantations. The objective of this research was spectral discrimination of nine important tea varieties in the presence of six natural vegetation species in Munnar, Western Ghat highlands of south India. Discrimination models using six methods: k-nearest neighborhood classifier (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), normalized spectral similarity score (NS3), maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied on the hyperspectral reflectance measurements collected at canopy level. The existence and statistical significance of spectral differences of the tea and natural vegetation species were assessed by MANOVA. Results indicate that six out of 9 tea varieties could be discriminated with best accuracies 75 to 80%. While a closer spectral similarity is observed in few tea varieties, the presence of natural vegetation species has decreased inter species variability for few tea varieties while enhancing the same for few other tea varieties at the cost of reducing spectral separability among the vegetation species. © 2014 IEEE.",classification; hyperspectral species level discrimination; MANOVA; spectral matching; Tea plantations,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Image processing; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Vegetation; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral reflectance; Linear discriminant analysis; MANOVA; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Spectral matchings; Statistical significance; Tea plantations; Signal processing,"Nidamanuri, R.R.; Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: rao@iist.ac.in",,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78147E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

It is still challenging problem in computer vision key area. The existing methodologies for image categorization like semantic modelling approaches, neural network approaches does not provides an accurate solution. This is due to inefficient feature extraction and their processing. Deep Learning is a new and emerging subfield in machine learning research. It consist of a set of algorithms that attempt to learn features using multiple layers where each layer represents higher level of abstraction of lower layers. The acceptance of deep learning concept is due to unsupervised and scalable nature of it. Manifold regularized deep learning architecture extracts the structural information of the input image which leads to better classification. Primarily low level features of an input image is obtained by SURF algorithm. This is inputted into DBN architecture to formulate high level features.

Every e-learning system is designed with a goal to help the student to establish his/her goals and help them when needed. But, the learning style of each student is different, consequently, learning progression and pattern varies among students. A learning style is a characteristic of psychological and cognitive behavior of a user under a learning phase. Hence, a good e-learning system is one which not only recommends concept based on knowledge level but also recommends the type of learning material which will help the student to learn or acquire a skill in the best way.

It has great potential to overcome the barriers of traditional learning systems. However, there are several challenges in MOOCs such as huge drop-out rates, improper automated assessments, varied student engagement, and attention etc. Learning Analytics helps us to contain such issues. Learning analytics, with the help of Big Data Technologies, helps us to interpret humongous MOOCs data to assess progress, predict performance and identify problems. To perform analytics, we developed a workflow using Apache Spark, a scalable inmemory computing framework. The data from edX platform has been used for experiments. It contains the information of more than 2 Lakh students from 39 courses. Initially, detailed statistical analysis has been carried out to understand the learning patterns and the behavior of online learners.

Thus differentiating fault from stressed conditions and making the protection scheme intelligent enough to stop the relay maloperations has become very important. There are a few computational intelligent techniques proposed in the literature for preventing relay maloperations. However with the increase in size and complexity of the power systems there have been situations during which there is change in network topology or system parameters. An online intelligent technique: online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) has been suggested in this paper which under such real time situations successfully furnishes accurate results. This online computational intelligence technique based on synchronized wide area measurements has been implemented to develop a classifier that differentiates fault from power swing and voltage instability.

Then, the composite model was designed using STL Decomposition where the decomposed components namely seasonal, trend and remainder components were forecasted by Snaive, ARIMA and XGBoost. STL gave better results than individual and hybrid models. This paper evaluates and analyzes why composite models give better results than an individual model and state that decomposition technique is better than the hybrid technique for this application. © 2017 IEEE.",ARIMA; Auto Regressive Neural Network; Sales Forecasting; STL decomposition; SVM; XGBoost,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Forecasting; Information management; Nonlinear systems; Sales; ARIMA; Auto-regressive; Decision making process; Decomposition technique; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Sales forecasting; XGBoost; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

So there is a great need to build automated quality management systems. Benefits of automating the quality management include reduced production cost and overall improvement in quality. Nowadays great deal of research is going on in the area of machine vision based grading of food products. Grading and sorting of cashew kernels are done manually in most of the countries which is time consuming and expensive. In this paper a real time classification system to automatically grade cashew kernels based on their color, texture, size and shape feature are presented. Multisresolutional wavelet and Contourlet transform are used for extracting texture features. The images of the cashew kernel are acquired using a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera, and then the images are preprocessed using an efficient background subtraction technique. Then various external features are extracted using machine learning techniques. For the experimental study, cashew kernels of five different varieties are collected. SVM and back propagation neural network classifiers are used and their performance in terms of accuracy is observed. © 2017 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Automation; Contourlet Transform; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine; Wavelet Transform,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Backpropagation; Charge coupled devices; Computer circuits; Food products; Grading; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Neural networks; Quality management; Support vector machines; Torsional stress; Wavelet transforms; Back propagation neural networks; Background subtraction techniques; Classification system; Contourlet transform; Machine learning techniques; Quality management systems; Reduced production; Wavelet and contourlet transform; Computer vision,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Challenges for an epidemiologist lies in reaching out and collecting information from a territory especially in getting informal reports from public rather than gathering formal reports from clinical trial people like doctors and micro biologists. The smart phones and internet usage is reaching out common people rapidly due to the technological growth over past 15 years. Hence technology adaptation using mobile apps would not be a major constraint in reaching out people for conducting surveillance. Our proposed methodology suggested for public health surveillance programme part of public health informatics is a smart phone based surveillance system where epidemiologist can trigger survey queries through web portal and notify them to all the intended community through mobile app of registered smart phone users. The information retrieved back as reply for the queries can be easily stored in centralized real time database and can be analyzed by using machine Learning techniques. Prediction messages, alert messages and precautionary messages are send to targeted group of community under epidemic surveillance as common message as well as individual messages specifically addressing an individual who had participated in the survey. Real time databases are ideal foil to the mobile health based epidemic surveillance system. The pilot testing of the proposed prototype provided the instant benefit of immediate reachability of survey to selected and intended group. Mobile app based surveillance provided much improved reporting of information in quick time on diseases, symptoms, factors and more. Information gathered was analyzed for substantiating cause and alert and preventive messages were immediately send through the same app. © 2017 IEEE.",mobile epidemic surveillance; mobile health; public health informatics; real time database,Database systems; Disease control; Epidemiology; Health; Internet of things; Learning systems; mHealth; Monitoring; Network security; Portals; Public health; Query languages; Security systems; Smartphones; Surveys; Telephone sets; Epidemic control; Machine learning techniques; Public health informatics; Public health surveillances; Real-time database; Surveillance systems; Technological growth; Technology adaptation; Cellular telephone systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Objectives to find new ways of making our everyday lives more energy efficient have now became an essential part of the tussle to sustain our present quality of living. This project targets domestic usage which has a more direct approach in changing the way we consume energy. In this project we take up House Hold Loads as the application but this project can also be applied for large industrial loads. Smart energy metering and normalized energy data on load usage are one of the major goal setters for the future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes. Load Monitoring (LM) is essential for energy management and cost fixing. To obtain appliance-specific energy consumption statistics that can further be used to formulate load scheduling strategies for optimal energy utilization, disaggregation of Load is essential. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an alternative and best method for Load Disaggregation, as it can distinguish devices from the aggregated data measured at only a centralized location.

As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. This helps in the shorter feedback cycle for the student and help them in overcoming these shortcomings through the recommendation engine. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The tutor system gives a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the know ledge tracing data and the skill meter are updated in real-time. The Another core feature of the tutor system is its recommendation engine which on the basis of the skill meter that is updated at the real time will find what all are the things that the student may be interested on and suggest him the path that could be more fruitful.

Pressure, venous and arterial leg ulcers are considered in this study. For this purpose, chronic wound images acquired by digital camera are enhanced using color correction, noise removal and color homogenization. Enhanced images in Cb color channel of YCbCr color space is used to extract wound bed with factorization based segmentation approach. Binary classification is performed to classify pressure ulcers and leg ulcers. The obtained results showed that the proposed segmentation method is capable of converging exactly to irregular wound boundaries. Hence, the suggested pipeline of processes seems to be promising for automatic segmentation and classification of pressure ulcers from leg ulcers aiding in the assessment of wound healing status. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Arterial ulcer; Binary classification; Factorization based segmentation; Pressure ulcer; Venous ulcer,Bins; Bioinformatics; Color; Diseases; Factorization; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Arterial ulcer; Automatic segmentations; Binary classification; Machine learning methods; Pressure ulcers; Segmentation methods; Venous ulcers; Ycbcr color spaces; Color image processing,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

The traditional approach for detection and classification of fruit and its maturity level is based on the naked eye observation by the experts, which is both time consuming and causes eye fatigue. Advance techniques in image processing and machine learning helps to automatic classify and count the fruits, accurately, quickly and non-destructively. A method to automatic detect and classify apple fruit maturity level, whether it is mature or immature based on its color features has been proposed. Images of the apple are resized and Image Processing Techniques are applied for the extraction of apple color components (R, G, B).

The syntactic approach for extraction process suffers from the overlapping chunking rules which result in noise extraction. We introduce a hybrid technique which combines machine learning and rule based model. A multi-label classifier identifies the effective rules which efficiently parse aspects and opinions from texts. This selection of rules reduce the amount of noise in extraction tasks. This is a novel attempt to learn syntactic rule fitness from a corpus using machine learning for accurate aspect extraction. As the model learns the syntactic rule prediction from the corpus, it makes the extraction method domain independent. It also allows studying the quality of syntactic rules in a different corpus. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The prime objective of this paper is to recognize emotions in speech and classify them in 7 emotion output classes namely, anger, boredom, disgust, anxiety, happiness, sadness and neutral. The proposed approach is based upon the Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and energy of the speech signals as feature inputs and uses Berlin database of emotional speech. The features extracted from speech are converted into a feature vector, which in turn are used to train different classification algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Decision Forest and Gradient Boosting.

Since this is mainly used for the application of robotics, surveillance tracking, human to machine interface, etc. to extract the target status. There are more number of video tracking system to identify the targeted region from the frame of given video. Since the performance of tracking can affect by sudden illumination changes, shadowing effect and uneven background. In moving object detection system, it suffers from dynamic background changing and shadow effect present in the video frames. Due to this, tracking of targeted region may misclassified and results in false detection of moving objects. To rectify this problem there are many techniques to detect and eliminate the shadow from frames like K-Means clustering, Fuzzy C-Means, etc. which are to segment both foreground and background from each frames. Then they remove/suppress shadow region and track the target. Since in that methods, segmentation is based on non-changing background of surveillance area. To rectify this problem, we propose a novel background normalization technique which is based on textural pattern analysis. In texture based system, there are several methods perform texture pattern extraction to verify the feature matching for target region analysis. In this work, we present a novel model of background clustering by using Neighborhood Chain Prediction (NCP) algorithm for uneven background. Here we also propose Differential Boundary Pattern (DBP) to extract texture of the frame for suppressing shadow pixels present in the frame. This is done by estimating lowest intensity present in that frame and predict the area by using DBP method and enhance the pixel to suppress shadow region. From this equalized frame of the given video, we split the frame into several grids. Then from that grid formatted frame, we extract histogram features of the targeted frame and provide classification for each grid in that frame. In that classification can be done by using Machine Learning Classification (MLC) method. This matched grid is consider as the tracked region and provide binary label to separate background and foreground. This type of visual tracking system is robust over sudden illumination changes and dynamic background by using the texture pattern analysis.

But, with changing climatic patterns, untimely rains, prolonged dry spells, depleting ground water and drought making every drop of water extremely precious, the need of the hour is to gauge and work towards the major aspects of water harvesting - 'Catchment'. Water Harvesting must be a key element of any strategy to bring an end to India's perennial swings between drought and flood and to meet the following SDGs for sustained development. This study presents a structured and meticulous approach, wielding 'Geospatial Analytics'to identify the prospective locations for Water Harvesting in arid and semi-arid parts of the country for sustainable development.This paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the background and motivation for this idea. Section 2 details out the objective. In section 3 we present the 'Literature Survey'on the work that has already been carried out in this field.

Bug tracking results may be employed by the software practitioners of large software projects effectively. The cost of detecting and correcting the defect becomes exponentially higher as we go from requirement analysis to the maintenance phase, where defects might even lead to loss of lives. Software metrics in conjunction with defect data can serve as basis for developing predictive models. Open source projects which encompass contributions from millions of people provide capacious dataset for testing. There have been diverse machine learning techniques proposed in the literature for analyzing complex relationships and extracting useful information from problems using optimal resources and time. However, more extensive research comparing these techniques is needed to establish superiority of one technique over another. This study aims at comparison of 14 ML techniques for development of effective defect prediction models. The issues addressed are 1) Construction of automated tool in Java to collect OO, inheritance and other metrics and detect bugs in classes extracted from open source repository, 2) Use of relevant performance measures to evaluate performance of predictive models to detect bugs in classes, 3) Statistical tests to compare predictive capability of different machine learning techniques, 4) Validation of defect prediction models. The results of the study show that Single Layer Perceptron is the best technique amongst all the techniques used in this study for development of defect prediction models. The conclusions drawn from this study can be used for practical applications by software practitioners to determine best technique for defect prediction and consequently carry out effective allocation of resources. © 2017 IEEE.",Bug prediction; Machine learning; Object-oriented metrics; Open source software; Software reliability,Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer software; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Open source software; Open systems; Program debugging; Software engineering; Software reliability; Statistical tests; Bug predictions; Defect prediction models; Empirical - comparisons; Machine learning techniques; Object oriented metrics; Open source repositories; Predictive capabilities; Single layer perceptron; Object oriented programming,,Niranjan Dr.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Wrist Pulse signals contain some crucial information about the health of a person and hence diagnosis based on Pulse signals has importance. According to the Ayurvedic science, our mind-body constitution or dosha is determined at the time of conception. Thus, we are each born with a distinct combination of the Vatta, Pitta, and Kapha doshas that remains as it is throughout your life. This is known as Prakruti. The balance of all these doshas and the Prakruti play a vital role in the social life. The paper proposes a framework to predict the Pulse after performing Surya Namaskar for people of different Prakruti at different Prahars (Morning, Afternoon or Evening). The identification of Prakruti of a person will be done using a questionnaire. Recording of the Wrist Pulse signals before and after performing Surya Namaskar at different times of the day or Prahar (Morning, Afternoon and Evening) form the dataset. The variations occurring in the Pulse signals shall be determined by processing the signals and these changes will be used as knowledge for our Machine Learning algorithm. This will be further used to predict the Pulse after performing Surya Namaskar and determining its effect on our daily life cycle. © 2017 IEEE.",Ayurveda; Neural Network; Prediction; Pulse; Yoga,Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Life cycle; Neural networks; Ayurveda; Daily lives; Medical systems; Processing the signals; Pulse; Pulse signal; Social life; Yoga; Big data,,Niranjan Dr.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This paper describes the development of a meticulous water distribution system at a city level that will guarantee a continuous supply of water, overcoming some major issues like unaccounted supply to entities and Non-Revenue Water (NRW). A centralized control room equipped with a local computing machine and a Human Machine Interface (HMI) to monitor and control the city's water system is proposed. A smart tariff system should be exercised with an IoT-enabled mobile-friendly web portal developed for accessing various water usage statistics accompanied with an option of paying water bills online. In this volumetric, limit based model, the quota assigned to each entity is decided dynamically based on various supply and demand parameters including the availability of water with changing seasons. Adaptive learning through machine learning algorithms was used for the same. Unbilled, unauthorized consumption, apparent losses (water theft and metering inaccuracies) and transportation losses was curbed by monitoring from a remote location via IoT. Higher degree of theft and leakage was concluded using loss detection technique using the differential flow data. Here, a novel, cost-effective, realtime monitorable and controllable system is proposed with an analysis on a model simulation being performed for optimal water distribution. © 2017 IEEE.",IoT; Machine Learning; NRW; quota; Smart water distribution,Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Crime; Economics; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Portals; Water distribution systems; Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Controllable systems; Distribution of water; Human Machine Interface; Metering inaccuracies; Monitor and control; quota; Water distributions; Water management systems; Smart city,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

In this paper, we present a mobile application based solution to empower the citizens to report instances of uncollected garbage and draw the attention of authorities. Our application has been successfully deployed and has seen more than a million complaints registered across many Indian cities. One of the challenges we have had to address on deployment of the application was the presence of a number of spurious complaints, such complaints result in unnecessary work by the municipal authorities. We tackled the challenge by using machine learning techniques to identify spurious complaints. We have been able to achieve an accuracy of over 85% in segregating the spurious complaints from actual ones by analyzing the image uploaded along with the complaint. The application can be used in real time once the model is trained. © 2017 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Smart city; Waste management; Machine learning techniques; Mobile applications; Municipal authorities; Real time; Urban areas; Urban cities; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

India's Index of Industrial Production (IIIP) is an index which conveys the status of production in the industrial sector of the economy. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) was applied to forecast IIIP. Accordingly, the inputs to the ANN consisted of data spanning from F.Y. 2004-05 to F.Y. 2013-14 of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Index of the Eight Core Industries (Electricity, Steel, Refinery Products, Crude Oil, Coal, Cement, Natural Gas and Fertilizers) to forecast IIIP. Therefore, a methodology for forecasting was developed using Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) and Nonlinear Autoregressive neural network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models. Several structures of the neural networks were tested for forecasting, and then the results were compared in terms of forecasting error. The NARX network with 11 hidden layers and 1 delay line provided the best results with a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 2.168. Thus, ANNs can be used for accurate forecasting of Industrial Production. © 2017 IEEE.",connectionism and neural nets; machine learning; time series analysis,Cement industry; Commerce; Crude oil; Developing countries; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Smart city; Time series analysis; Autoregressive neural networks; Connectionism; Consumer price index; Forecasting error; Gross domestic products; Index of industrial productions; Industrial production; Whole sale prices; Forecasting,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

However, the benefits and limitations of these techniques make the development of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS), an open challenge. This paper presents an adaptive, and a robust intrusion detection technique using Hypergraph based Genetic Algorithm (HG - GA) for parameter setting and feature selection in Support Vector Machine (SVM). Hyper – clique property of Hypergraph was exploited for the generation of initial population to fasten the search for the optimal solution and to prevent the trap at the local minima. HG-GA uses a weighted objective function to maintain the trade-off between maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false alarm rate, along with the optimal number of features. The performance of HG-GA SVM was evaluated using NSL-KDD intrusion dataset under two scenarios (i) All features and (ii) informative features obtained from HG – GA. Experimental results show the prominence of HG-GA SVM over the existing techniques in terms of classifier accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate, and runtime analysis. © 2017",Feature subset; Genetic algorithm; Hypergraph; Intrusion detection system; Kernel parameters; Support vector machine,Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Errors; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Image resolution; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Network security; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Support vector machines; Feature subset; Hypergraph; Initial population; Intrusion Detection Systems; Kernel parameter; Network infrastructure; Parameter optimization; Weighted objective function; Intrusion detection,"Shankar Sriram, V.S.; Centre for Information Super Highway (CISH), School of Computing, SASTRA UniversityIndia; email: sriram@it.sastra.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,9507051,,KNSYE,,English,Knowl Based Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028026731

Due to this, the traditional signature-based methods for detection of malware effectively becomes an obsolete method. The efficiency of the machine learning model in context to the detection of malware files has been proved by different researches and studies. In this paper, a framework has been developed to detect and classify different files (e.g exe, pdf, php, etc.) as benign and malicious using two level classifier namely, Macro (for detection of malware) and Micro (for classification of malware files as a Trojan, Spyware, Adware, etc.). Cuckoo Sandbox is used for generating static and dynamic analysis report by executing files in the virtual environment. In addition, a novel model is developed for extracting features based on static, behavioral and network analysis using analysis report generated by the Cuckoo Sandbox. Weka Framework is used to develop machine learning models by using training datasets. The experimental results using proposed framework shows high detection rate with an accuracy of 100% using J48 Decision tree model, 99% using SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) and 97% using Random Forest tree. It also shows effective classification rate with accuracy 100% using J48 Decision tree, 91% using SMO and 66% using Random Forest tree. These results are used for detecting and classifying unknown files as benign or malicious. 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cuckoo Sandbox; Dynamic Analysis; Malware Classification; Malware Detection; SMO; Static,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer viruses; Data mining; Decision trees; Dynamic analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machinery; Optimization; Security of data; Virtual reality; Cuckoo Sandbox; Decision tree modeling; Machine learning models; Malware classifications; Malware detection; Sequential minimal optimization; Static; Static and dynamic analysis; Malware,,Dhaka V.S.Elci A.Gaur M.S.Bohra M.K.Shekhawat R.S.,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

It classifies the text into positive, negative or neutral. Lexicon-based and Supervised Machine Learning-based are the two main approaches in sentiment analysis. Bag-of-words model is used to represent the text as a vector of independent words and machine learning algorithms are used for classification. Polarity shift is the major problem in the Bag-of-words model. Polarity shift is a sentiment classification problem. It can reverse the sentiment polarity of the text. Classification performance of machine learning based systems can get affected by polarity shift. Negation is the type of polarity shift. Negative words can change the polarity of the sentimental words. Polarity shift detection methods are used to detect the polarity shift in the sentences. It helps to improve the performance of machine learning classification algorithms. Natural Language Processing can be used for feature extraction and classification. Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing for extraction of opinion words from the text. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in identifying the opinion of the people about a specific topic or entity.

Many of these sensory systems are artificially replicated to provide intelligence to the machines. This paper reviews the various techniques and instruments that can be used to design a human olfactory system, which can be used in different applications. The odour detection systems can be broadly classified into four categories such as gas sensors, bio-sensors, gas chromatography systems and hybrid systems. Other common odour detection instruments like electronic noses (E-noses), mass spectrometers (MS), differential optical absorption spectrometers (DOAS) are also reviewed in this paper. The selection of any odour detection technique is influenced by several factors like on-field deployability, odour detection and classification capabilities, sensitivity of the instruments and sensitivity of the instruments to the air matrices. Among all the possible detection methods, Electronic nose is having advanced capabilities as compared to other instruments. The presence of interference noise act as a major hindrance for the efficiency of the odour detection devices. Integration of gas chromatography along with interference filters can provide an increased accuracy in the odour detection. © 2017 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Classification; Machine learning; Odour sensors,Artificial intelligence; Audition; Chromatography; Classification (of information); Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electronic equipment; Gas chromatography; Hybrid systems; Learning systems; Light absorption; Spectrometers; Detection device; Detection instruments; Detection methods; Detection sensors; Differential optical absorption spectrometers; Interference filters; Interference noise; Olfactory systems; Electronic nose,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In the beginning, no one may have thought internet would be a host of numerous amazing services like the social networking. Today we can say that online applications and social networking websites have become a non separable part of one's life. Many people from diverse age groups spend hours daily on such websites. Despite the fact that people are emotionally connected together through social media, these facilities bring along big threats with them such as cyber attacks, which includes online grooming and cyberbullying. The primary objective of this project is to detect such cases over the social media and implement some preventive measures so as to avoid such incidents. Using machine learning and data mining techniques we can achieve our goal.

Mel cepstral co-efficients (MFCC's) have been successfully used in music genre classification but they do not reflect the correlation between the adjacent co-efficients of Mel filters of a frame neither the relation between adjacent co-efficients of Mel filters of neighboring frames. This leads to loss of useful features. In this work, Hu moment based features are extracted from the spectrogram to study impact of energy concentration in the spectrogram. Under different musical genres the difference in rhythm in genres drastically changes the texture of spectrogram image. This alters the energy concentration in spectrogram. Hu moments being invariant to translation, scaling as well as rotation can capture useful features from spectrogram that are not considered by the MFCC's. Since the spectral moments are computed locally, they can assess the intensity of energy concentration at certain frequencies in spectrogram and prove as distinct features in characterizing different genres of music. Hu moment based features along with conventional music features lead to an accuracy of 83.33% for classifying 5 genres. © 2017 IEEE.",Hu moment; Music features; Music Genre Classification; Pearson universal kernel,Learning systems; Genre classification; Hu moments; Machine learning techniques; Music features; Music genre classification; Musical genre classification; Pearson universal kernel; Research and development; Spectrographs,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This migration of clients has led to increased burden on the resources such as CPU, network and memory. Hence, the problem of high power consumption, increased carbon footprints and need for higher cooling effects arose. However, resource scheduling and provisioning has become a milestone to handle such diverse issues related to cloud and get them under centralized control system. Workload prediction is an utmost requirement to dynamically predict the incoming workload and schedule the resources according to client needs. Dynamic workload prediction based on historical data can prove useful for pattern matching of current scenario with the past ones and allocate the resources in the most efficient way. This paper aims to propose a prototype model for workload prediction using machine learning models to handle the dynamic nature of the cloud infrastructure. This prediction is then used for resource provisioning.

Brain MRI classification into normal and abnormal has received increasing attention because of the high level of difficulty in handling those huge numbers of images. Recently, many computational techniques are widely employed to segregate the normal images from pathological. Thus, this study has attempted to analyse the capability of various supervised data mining techniques in classifying the brain MR images. Initially, the images are pre-processed and the volumetric features are extracted. Then, these are fed into feature selection techniques viz. Principal Component Analysis, Runs, Fisher filtering and ReliefF feature selection to determine relevant features. The selected features are utilised for the supervised data mining techniques viz. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Tree and C4.5 to identify the abnormal images of brain. Among them, SVM has achieved highest accuracy of 71.33% with the features extracted through ReliefF feature selection with Leave-One-Out cross validation. Random Tree achieved accuracy of 82% with Runs filtered features. The classification will aid the segmentation of brain tumor from large set of MRI slices by eliminating the normal slices. This greatly reduces the computational time and memory required for the process of segmentation. © 2017 IEEE.",Brain Tumor; Classification; Data Mining; Machine Learning Challenge; Magnetic Resonance Images,Brain; Computation theory; Computational methods; Data mining; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image classification; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Principal component analysis; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Tumors; Accurate prediction; Brain tumors; Computational technique; Computational time and memory; Leave-one-out cross validations; Level of difficulties; Selection techniques; Volumetric features; Classification (of information),,Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

It is nearly impossible for human to process all these data and it is even difficult for computers to extract the information since it is not stored in structured format. Identifying the named entities and classifying them can help in extracting the useful information in the unstructured text documents. This paper presents a new method of utilizing biomedical knowledge by both exact matching of disease dictionary and adding semantic concept feature through UMLS semantic type filtering, in order to improve the human disease named entity recognition by machine learning. By engineering the concept semantic type into feature set, we demonstrate the importance of domain knowledge on machine learning based disease NER.

This work enhances the edge-preserving maximally stable extremal regions (eMSER) algorithm using the pyramid histogram of oriented gradients (PHOG). Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) derived from different pyramid levels is important while detecting maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) in the ETDT approach because it gives more spatial information when compared to HOG information from a single level. To group text, a four-line, text-grouping method is newly designed for this work. Also, a new text feature, Shapeness Score is proposed, which significantly identifies text regions when combined with the other features based on morphology and stroke widths. Using the feature vector of dimension 10, the J48 decision tree and AdaBoost machine learning algorithms identify the text regions in the images. The algorithm yields better results than the existing benchmark algorithms for the ICDAR 2011 born-digital dataset and must be improved with respect to the scene text dataset. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",MSER; PHOG; Shapeness score; Stroke width; Text detection,Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Graphic methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; MSER; PHOG; Shapeness score; Stroke widths; Text detection; Character recognition,"Joan, S.P.F.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna UniversityIndia; email: faustina.joan.sp@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13873326,,,,English,Inf.

The automated delineation of lesion is a prerequisite prior to characterization, which is challenging itself. Thus, this paper has two major objectives: (a) design of a segmentation system which can model by learning the lesion characteristics and this is posed as a Bayesian model; (b) develop a psoriasis risk assessment system (pRAS) by crisscrossing the blocks which drives the fundamental machine learning paradigm. Methods The segmentation system uses the knowledge derived by the experts along with the features reflected by the lesions to build a Bayesian framework that helps to classify each pixel of the image into lesion vs. background. Since this lesion has several stages and grades, hence the system undergoes the risk assessment to classify into five levels of severity: healthy, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. We build nine kinds of pRAS utilizing different combinations of the key blocks. These nine pRAS systems use three classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN)) and three feature selection techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and Mutual Information (MI)). The two major experiments conducted using these nine systems were: (i) selection of best system combination based on classification accuracy and (ii) understanding the reliability of the system. This leads us to computation of key system performance parameters such as: feature retaining power, aggregated feature effect and reliability index besides conventional attributes like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. Results Using the database used in this study consisted of 670 psoriasis images, the combination of SVM and FDR was revealed as the optimal pRAS system and yielded a classification accuracy of 99.84% using cross-validation protocol. Further, SVM-FDR system provides the reliability of 99.99% using cross-validation protocol. Conclusions The study demonstrates a fully novel model of segmentation embedded with risk assessment. Among all nine systems, SVM-FDR produced best results. Further, we validated our pRAS system with automatic segmented lesions against manually segmented lesions showing comparable performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian segmentation; Color features; Machine learning; Performance evaluation; Psoriasis; Texture features,"Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Dermatology; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Reliability; Support vector machines; Bayesian segmentation; Color features; Performance evaluation; Psoriasis; Texture features; Risk assessment; Article; Bayes theorem; benchmarking; classifier; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity assessment; Fsher Discriminant Ratio; image segmentation; machine learning; Mutual Information; nerve cell network; principal component analysis; psoriasis; risk assessment; support vector machine; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; discriminant analysis; human; pathology; psoriasis; reproducibility; risk assessment; Bayes Theorem; Decision Trees; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Principal Component Analysis; Psoriasis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Support Vector Machine","Suri, J.S.; Skin Point-of-Care Division, Global Biomedical Technologies, Inc.United States; email: jsuri@comcast.net",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28859832,English,Comput.

Inability of the heart to restore normal perfusion to the entire body refers to cardiac failure, which then with symptoms results in manifestation of congestive heart failure (CHF). Impairment in systolic function associated with chronic dilation of left ventricle is referred as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The clinical examination, surface electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, blood markers and echocardiography play major role in the diagnosis of CHF. Though the ECG manifests chamber enlargement changes, it does not possess sensitive marker for the diagnosis of DCM, whereas echocardiographic assessment can effectively reveal the presence of asymptomatic DCM. This work proposes an automated screening method for classifying normal and CHF echocardiographic images affected due to DCM using variational mode decomposition technique. The texture features are extracted from variational mode decomposed image. These features are selected using particle swarm optimization and classified using support vector machine classifier with different kernel functions. We have validated our experiment using 300 four-chamber echocardiography images (150: normal, 150: CHF) obtained from 50 normal and 50 CHF patients. Our proposed approach yielded maximum average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.33%, 98.66% and 100%, respectively, using ten features. Thus, the developed diagnosis system can effectively detect CHF in its early stage using ultrasound images and aid the clinicians in their diagnosis. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Congestive heart failure; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Machine learning; Texture features; VMD,Automation; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Heart; Image processing; Learning systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Ultrasonic applications; Congestive heart failures; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Echocardiographic images; Echocardiography Images; Mode decomposition techniques; Sensitivity and specificity; Support vector machine classifiers; Texture features; Image texture,"Raghavendra, U.; Department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal UniversityIndia; email: raghavendra.u@manipal.edu",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

We analyze to which extent the calling activity of mobile phone users is predictable. The premise is that mobile phone users exhibit temporal regularity in their interactions with majority of their contacts. In the sociological context, most social interactions have fairly reliable temporal regularity. If we quantify the extension of this behavior to interactions on mobile phones we expect that pairwise interaction is not merely a result of randomness, rather it exhibits a temporal pattern. To this end, we not only tested our approach on an original mobile phone usage dataset from a developing country, Pakistan, but we also analyzed the famous Reality Mining Dataset and the Nokia Dataset (from a European country), where we found an equitable basis for comparison with our data. Our original data consists of 783 users and more than 12,000 active dyads.

This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers.

In many such applications, availability of labeled medical dataset is a primary challenge and dataset of dental diseases is not an exception. An attempt towards accurate classification of dental diseases is addressed in this paper. Labeled dataset consisting of 251 Radio Visiography (RVG) x-ray images of 3 different classes is used for classification. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a most effective tool in machine learning which enables solving the problems like image recognition, segmentation, classification, etc., with high order of accuracy. It is found from literature that CNN performs well in natural image classification problems where large dataset is available. In this paper we experimented on the performance of CNN for diagnosis of small labeled dental dataset. In addition, transfer learning is used to improve the accuracy. Experimental results are presented for three different architectures of CNN. Overall accuracy achieved is very encouraging. © 2017 IEEE.",Computer Vision; Convolutional Neural Network(CNN); Machine Learning (ML); Transfer Learning (TL),Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Convolution; Diagnosis; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Information analysis; Learning systems; Neural networks; Assistance system; Convolutional neural network; Different class; Effective tool; Labeled dataset; Medical dataset; Overall accuracies; Transfer learning; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Int.

This paper presents a completely unique emotional modeling methodology for incorporating human feeling into intelligent systems. The projected approach includes a technique to elicit emotion factors from users, a replacement illustration of emotions and a framework for predicting and pursuit user’s emotional mechanical phenomenon over time. The neural network based CML service has better training concert and enlarged exactness compare to other large scale deep learning systems. Opinions are important to almost all human activities and cloud based sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment related information from text. With the rising popularity and availability of opinion rich resources such as personal blogs and online appraisal sites, new opportunities and issues arise as people now, actively use information technologies to explore and capture others opinions. In the existing system, a segmentation ranking model is designed to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification. A classification model is used for predicting the sentiment polarity of segmentation. The joint framework is trained directly using the sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without the use of any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. However the existing system still has issue with classification accuracy results. To improve the classification performance, in the proposed system, cloud integrate the support vector machine, naive bayes and neural network algorithms along with joint segmentation approaches has been proposed to classify the very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative features more effectively using important feature selection. Also to handle the outliers we apply modified k-means clustering method on the given dataset. It is used to cloud cluster the outliers and hence the label as well as unlabeled features is handled efficiently. From the experimental result, we conclude that the proposed system yields better performance than the existing system. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Classification; Cloud clustering; Cloud machine learning; Segmentation; Sentiment analysis,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Statistics; Classification accuracy; Classification models; Classification performance; Machine learning techniques; Modified k-means clustering; Neural network algorithm; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Learning systems,"Arulmurugan, R.; Department of Information Technology, Bannari Amman Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: arulmr@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030089501

Every single day, we hear of emergency situations in flights like fires, birdstrikes, diversions, engine failures and emergency landings etc. Across the globe, Air Traffic Controllers are constantly monitoring the in-flight situation based on inputs from the pilots and advicing them on possible diversions or measures to take so as to avoid any danger to the lifes of passengers and the cabin crew. Though, the manual monitoring of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Conversations is efficient and reliable, but still, it may be subject to human biass and glitches. Also, post-flight monitoring is difficult because there is no such automatic measure for arriving at the conclusion, whether the flight faced an emergency or not. Audio Signal Processing finds an interesting use in this case. By extracting some crucial features from an audio conversation, one can proceed towards the classification once the feautres seem good and efficient. The paper mainly focusses on extracting these features critical to ATC analysis. In the future, with availablity of good database, the paper can be expanded to classify the conversations using Machine Learning techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",Energy; Feature Extraction; MFCC; Support Vector Machine; Volume; Zero Crossing Rate,Air navigation; Air transportation; Audio signal processing; Aviation; Classification (of information); Control towers; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Patient monitoring; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Traffic control; Traffic signals; Air traffic control (ATC); Air traffic controller; Emergency situation; Energy; Machine learning techniques; MFCC; Volume; Zero crossing rate; Air traffic control,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Basic Electrical Engineering is one amongst these courses. The traditional way of teaching the course was teacher-centric and aid used for teaching was chalk and talk. Less emphasis was given for student interaction. Traditional style of teaching rarely gives students the opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge to actual situations, resulting in a serious time lag between students learning and applying new knowledge. As a result many students have trouble determining the relevance of what they are being taught, and thus lacking any obvious need to learn and fail to engage in the learning process. In teaching learning process, learning style of an individual is important to undergo different learning cycle. The three main types of learning styles are, auditory, visual, and tactile. With the help of a tool students learning style was identified through a set of questionnaires which helped to design an activity depending upon the learning styles of a student. From the survey it has been identified the majority of the class are visual learners which helped in designing an activity. The proposed model is applied to the course on Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. Apart from the regular classroom teaching, principles of instruction was used to select, plan and develop an activity based on Industry visit to enhance students learning. To realize the impact of learning happened through the industry visit pertaining to topic on actuators the written examination was conducted and feedback at two intervals, before and after the industry visit was taken. Individual question wise inferential statistical analysis using paired t-test was performed and inferred that the activity improved the knowledge and exposure level of a student with different learning style. From the activity it is also inferred that though a small percentage of students are auditory learners, visual learning has helped the student to enhance the conceptual learning through visualization. © 2016 IEEE.",Experiential learning; Learning style; Statistical analysis,Curricula; Education computing; Educational technology; Engineering research; Learning systems; Statistical methods; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Classroom teaching; Conceptual learning; Experiential learning; Learning process; Learning Style; Student interactions; Students learning; Teaching-learning process; Education,"Salunke, M.; KLE Technological UniversityIndia; email: minal@bvb.edu",Ramachandran M.Garg D.Kumar V.A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis are considered to be of higher order, requiring diverse learning and teaching methods than the customary learning of facts and concepts. HOTS involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. They are activated when individuals encounter unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions, or dilemmas. Successful application of the skills results in justifications, decisions, performances, and products that are valid within the context of existing knowledge that encourages continued growth in other intellectual skills. The major difficulty in attaining HOTS among engineering students is that we still pursue the traditional approach of teacher-centered classroom where the teacher is an active transmitter and the students are passive recipients. To achieve HOTS among engineering students we establish an Active Learning Environment (ALE) with the effective usage of Information and communication technologies (ICT). Active learning is embodied in a learning environment where the teachers and students are actively engaged with the content through discussions, problem-solving, critical thinking, or a multitude of activities that encourage interaction among learners, instructors and the material. Supporting to active learning, the ICT usage lends itself to more student-centered learning. This paper demonstrates the strategies to achieve HOTS through various ALE strategies like Role Play, Jigsaw, Brainstorming, debate, Mind map etc for Concept Understanding and Group assignments, combined mini projects, Discussion on Topics, Quiz, and Puzzles for Concept Applying. We have applied various learning strategies and assessed the student outcomes. HOTS is achieved by developing applications or products, with improved inter personal skills and lifelong learning skills. The evidence for the effectiveness of ALE among engineering students is showed by great improvement in their academic result, placement record and research interests. © 2016 IEEE.",Active learning environment; Higher-order thinking; Information and communication technologies; Student-centered learning,Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Educational technology; Engineering education; Engineering research; Learning systems; Problem solving; Students; Teaching; Active learning environment; Higher order thinking skills; Higher-order thinkings; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning and teachings; Learning environments; Student-centered learning; Traditional approaches; Education,,Ramachandran M.Garg D.Kumar V.A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Here access to cloud environment is via internet services in which data stored on cloud environment are easier to both internal and external intruders. To detect intruders, various intrusion detection systems and authentication systems was proposed in earlier researches which are primarily ineffective. Many existing researchers were concentrated on machine learning approaches for detecting intrusions using fuzzy clustering, artificial neural network, support vector machine, fuzzy with neural network and etc., which are not furnishing predominant results based on detection rate and false negative rates. Our proposed system directed on intrusion detection system and it uses cloudlet controller, trust authority and virtual machine management in cloud environment. We propose two novel algorithms such as (i) packet scrutinization algorithm which examines the packets from the users and (ii) hybrid classification model called “NK-RNN” which is a combination of normalized K-means clustering algorithm with recurrent neural network. For preventing the user from intruders, we propose a one time signature for cloud user in order to access the data on cloud environment. Our proposed classifier effectively detects the intruders which are experimentally proved by comparing with existing classification models. Thus our proposed results are expressed by packet loss ratio, average packet delay, throughput, detection rate, false positive rate and false negative rate. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Cloud computing; Cloudlets; DDOS; Flood attacks; IDS; Queue modeling; RNN classifier; U2R attacks; Zero day attacks and R2L attacks,Cloud computing; Clustering algorithms; Computer crime; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Network security; Neural networks; Packet networks; Recurrent neural networks; Cloudlets; DDOS; Flood attacks; Queue models; U2R attacks; Zero day attack; Intrusion detection,"Balamurugan, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mohammed Sathak Engineering CollegeIndia; email: vbalamuruganmsec@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029704782

DR is widely applied for better data visualization and improving learning in all the above fields. In this manuscript, we propose a novel DR approach namely, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) by developing Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS). Traditional pattern selection methods discriminate boundary and non-boundary patterns with the help of class information and nearest neighbors. And these methods completely ignore noisy patterns which may degrade the performance of subsequent subspace learning. To overcome this, we develop Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS), in which data instances are partitioned into boundary, non-boundary and noisy patterns. With the help of noisy-free boundary and non-boundary patterns, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) has been proposed by developing new within and between-class scatters. These scatters model discriminations between lengths (L2-norms) of different class instances by considering only boundary and non-boundary patterns, while ignoring noisy patterns. A cosine hyperbolic frame work has been developed to formulate the objective of NLDA. Moreover, NLDA can also model the discrimination of multimodal data as different class data may consist of different lengths. Experimental study conducted on the synthesized data, UCI, and leeds butterfly databases. Moreover, an experimental study over human and computer interaction, i.e., face recognition (one of the application areas of expert and intelligent systems), has been performed. And, these studies prove that the proposed method can produce better discriminated subspace compare to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cosine hyperbolic; Dimensionality reduction; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Relevant patterns; Subspace learning,Data mining; Data visualization; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Human computer interaction; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Between class scatter; Cosine hyperbolic; Dimensionality reduction; Model discrimination; NAtural language processing; Relevant patterns; State-of-the-art methods; Subspace learning; Pattern recognition,"Murthy, K.R.email: k.ramachandra@isical.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016401105

This is usually done by addition of newer hardware, whose configuration might differ from the existing nodes. As a result, clusters are becoming heterogeneous in nature. For many real world machine learning and data mining applications, data is represented in the form of graphs. Most of the existing distributed graph processing frameworks such as Pregel and Graphlab assume that the computational nodes are homogeneous. These frameworks split the graph into approximately equal subgraphs, which is appropriate for homogeneous clusters. In heterogeneous clusters, these frameworks perform poorly in most of the scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, GraphIVE is the only heterogeneity-aware graph processing framework. It learns the relative capabilities of the nodes based on runtime metrics of previous jobs and partitions the graph proportionally. However, it may not perform well if a new job differs drastically in terms of resource requirements when compared to previous jobs executed on the cluster. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphSteal, a dynamic graph re-partitioning policy for vertex-cut based graph processing frameworks on heterogeneous clusters. GraphSteal dynamically re-partitions the graph based on the runtime characteristics of the job. To avoid computational skew in the cluster, it migrates edges from slow nodes to fast nodes. To demonstrate our approach, we modify the source code of Graphlab to incorporate dynamic graph re-partitioning strategy.

In an environment that has strict compliance requirements, such as HIPAA compliance, a critical role for an SDN controller is to route all data packets while considering data privacy preservation and compliance-preservation. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a routing protocol for SDN which is an efficient risk-based swarm routing protocol. The programmable capability of controllers is exploited in order to minimize privacy and compliance risks in data transmission. The proposed routing protocol is based on the Ant Colony Optimization technique and machine learning, while the data for learning is obtained from OVSDB and the OpenvSwitch Database management protocol. We collect a history of packet transfers for training purposes and learn from the training data to efficiently and intelligently route sensitive data packets while it preserves the target compliance. This routing is obtained by intelligent eviction of rules that are downloaded to the switches. We have implemented the proposed schemes based on an RYU controller. © 2017 IEEE.",cloud computing; compliance-preservation; privacy; routing; SDN; security,Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Controllers; Data privacy; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Routing protocols; Database management; Enterprise networks; Packet transfer; Privacy preservation; routing; security; Software defined networking (SDN); Training purpose; Compliance control,,Fox G.C.,IEEE Computer Society,21596182,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The effects of an emotion in one session of communication can persist across sessions.

Self reports recording emotion states after typing sessions capture persistence of emotion. We use this data to train a personalized machine learning model for multi-state emotion classification. We implemented an Android based smartphone application, called TapSense, that records typing related metadata, and uses a carefully designed Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to collect emotion self reports.

The facial expression variation generally reflects clue for the occurrence of pain. This offers a vital aspect for non-verbal patients who are not in a position to rate their pain intensity level. The hypothesis proposes the developing of a multimodal machine based tool which will assess pain intensity. A framework has been designed to meet up with these specific issues which involve extracting features from the face and genes involved in pain. Patients suffering from pain require a comprehensive assessment to be conducted for proper diagnosis. The contributions of this paper are fourfold: Firstly, this paper provides an efficient approach to computational pain quantification. Secondly, it investigates the medical practitioner perception to pain along with the readings of the various tools available. Thirdly, the psychological aspect is taken into consideration to predict how pain is perceived by observers and experts (physicians). Fourthly, genes involved in pain and no pain conditions are taken and classified. Three large databases of spontaneous pain expressions are used i.e., McMaster UNBC Pain Archive database, self-prepared database and the other BioVid heat pain database of pain to verify the accuracy and robustness of the system. The methodology achieves 87% accuracy rate for classification of frames amid four levels of pain intensity. Designing intelligent computing systems with the given methodology will certainly improve the quality of life of patients. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Intelligent computing system; Machine learning; Pain; Pain expression; Pain intensity,Database systems; Diagnosis; Genes; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Comprehensive assessment; Facial expression variations; Medical expenditures; Medical practitioner; Pain; Pain expression; Pain intensity; Psychological Aspects; Health,"Singh, S.K.; Rajarshi School of Management and TechnologyIndia; email: sanjursmt@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022021798

The previous outcomes recommend that the overlapping between classes and the presence of noise have the most grounded impact on the performance of learning algorithm, and software defect datasets are no exceptions. The class overlap problem is concerned with the performance of machine learning classifiers critical problem is class overlap in which data samples appear as valid examples of more than one class which may be responsible for the presence of noise in datasets. We aim to investigate how the presence of overlapped instances in a dataset influences the classifier’s performance, and how to deal with class overlapping problem. To have a close estimate of class overlapping, we have proposed four different measures namely, nearest enemy ratio, subconcept ratio, likelihood ratio and soft margin ratio. We performed our investigations using 327 binary defect classification datasets obtained from 54 software projects, where we first identified overlapped datasets using three data complexity measures proposed in the literature. We also include treatment effort into the prediction process. Subsequently, we used our proposed measures to find overlapped instances in the identified overlapped datasets. Our results indicated that by training a classifier on a training data free from overlapped instances led to an improved classifier performance on the test data containing overlapped instances. The classifiers perform significantly better when the evaluation measure takes the effort into account. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Class overlapping; Data complexity measures; Data mining; Machine learning; Software defect prediction,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Defects; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Class overlapping; Classifier performance; Critical problems; Data complexity; Defect classification; Evaluation measures; Prediction process; Software defect prediction; Classification (of information),"Gupta, S.; Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing JabalpurIndia; email: shivani.panchal@iiitdmj.ac.in",,Springer-Verlag Wien,0010485X,,CMPTA,,English,Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009227462

Our method relies on different aspects of writing: the presence of redundant patterns in the writing and its features. Signatures are analyzed at small fragments in which we seek to extract the patterns that an individual employs frequently as he writes. We exploit different features of writing like orientation, centroid and contour by computing a set of features from writing samples at different levels of observations. Orientation like intersecting point, edge point and gradient change of signature achieve great success in feature description. These features are extracted from the standard signature database and extracted features are trained and tested by machine learning (ML) approach. The machine learning approaches like Bagging, Random subspace (RS) and REP tree are used for classification purpose. Bagging with 10 iterations and base learner achieved efficiency upto 88 %. RS randomly selects features from feature set and creates new feature set. It uses decision tree as base classifier with different tree size. RS achieved efficiency same as Bagging but has more statistical errors. However, in case of REP tree we have achieved efficiency upto 75 %. The experimental results show that the Bagging and RS achieves promising results on publicly available data set. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Authentication system; Biometric recognition; Machine learning; Parametric feature extraction; Signature verification,Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Decision trees; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Authentication systems; Biometric recognition; Feature description; Machine learning approaches; Redundant patterns; Signature database; Signature verification; Statistical errors; Learning systems,"Maheshkar, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines)India; email: sushila_mheshkar@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015728432

Images can be distorted from multiple sources like a fault in sensors, camera shake, poor lighting, over-exposure etc. All these distortions reduce the visual quality of images. Assessing the quality of images can be done with the use of a reference image of the same scene or without it. Without the use of reference image, quality assessment is a very difficult task. Machine learning approaches are very common in no-reference image quality assessment. No reference strategies are very useful if the type of distortion is known. Contrast assessment is a very important application in image processing as poor contrast images are difficult for automated image processing. In this paper, we propose a no-reference image quality measure for images with respect to contrast using random forest regression and validate the results using standard datasets.

This also aims at reducing the computational cost and providing a faster recognition system. This paper presents the formal algorithms for feature extraction with multivariate statistical techniques in complex domain and compare them their real domain counterpart. This paper also presents a classifier structure (OCON : One-Class-in-One-Neuron) which contains an ensemble of novel higher order neurons, which drastically reduces the complexity of proposed learning machine because only single neuron is sufficient to recognize a subject in the database.

The existing techniques such as expert opinion, analogy and disaggregation are mostly observed to be ad hoc and in this manner inclined to be mistaken in a number of cases. One of the various approaches for calculating effort of agile projects in an empirical way is the story point approach (SPA). This paper presents a study on analysis of prediction accuracy of estimation process executed in order to improve it using SPA.

From the past decade, P2P traffic has been contributing to major portion of Internet traffic which is still rising and hence is consuming a lot of network traffic bandwidth. It also worsens congestion of network traffic significantly and degrades the performance of traditional client–server applications. Popularity of various P2P applications has led Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to face various challenges regarding efficiently and fairly utilizing network resources. The traditional methods of identifying P2P traffic such as port-based and payload-based are proving ineffective due to their significant limitations and can be bypassed. Hence, new approaches based on statistics or behaviour of network traffic needs to be developed and adopted in order to accurately identify existing and new P2P traffic which emerge over the time. This article presents a survey regarding various strategies involved in identifying P2P traffic. Furthermore, conceptual analysis of network traffic measurement and monitoring is also presented. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Machine learning; P2P traffic identification; Payload based classification; Peer-to-Peer; Port based classification; Statistical based classification; Traffic measurement,Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Internet service providers; Learning systems; Media streaming; Peer to peer networks; Surveys; World Wide Web; Conceptual analysis; Instant messaging; Network traffic measurement; P2p traffic identification; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer traffic; Server applications; Traffic measurements; Traffic congestion,"Rai, M.K.; Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar-Delhi, G.T.

Early detection of those classes of a software which are prone to change is critical for software developers and project managers as it can aid in efficient resource allocation of limited resources. Moreover, change prone classes should be efficiently restructured and designed to prevent introduction of defects. Recently, use of search based techniques and their hybridized counter-parts have been advocated in the field of software engineering predictive modeling as these techniques help in identification of optimal solutions for a specific problem by testing the goodness of a number of possible solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for change prediction using search-based techniques and hybridized techniques. Further, we address the following issues: (i) low repeatability of empirical studies, (ii) less use of statistical tests for comparing the effectiveness of models, and (iii) non-assessment of trade-off between runtime and predictive performance of various techniques. This paper presents an empirical validation of search-based techniques and their hybridized versions, which yields unbiased, accurate and repeatable results. The study analyzes and compares the predictive performance of five search-based, five hybridized techniques and four widely used machine learning techniques and a statistical technique for predicting change prone classes in six application packages of a popular operating system for mobile—Android. The results of the study advocate the use of hybridized techniques for developing models to identify change prone classes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Change proneness; Empirical validation; Hybridized techniques; Object-oriented metrics; Predictive modeling; Search-based techniques,Artificial intelligence; Defects; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Learning systems; Software engineering; Software testing; Change proneness; Empirical validation; Hybridized techniques; Object oriented metrics; Predictive modeling; Search-based; Object oriented programming,"Malhotra, R.; Delhi Technological UniversityIndia; email: ruchikamalhotra2004@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,9288910,,ASOEE,,English,Autom Software Eng,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982298222

Trajectory data are obtained using GPS devices that capture the position of an object at specific time intervals. These enormous amounts of data necessitates to explore efficient and effective techniques to extract useful information to solve real world problems. Traffic flow pattern mining is one of the challenging issues for many applications. In a literature significant number of approaches are available to cluster the trajectory data, however the clustering has not been explored for trajectories pattern mining in bi-directional road networks. This paper presents a novel technique for excavating heavy traffic flow patterns in bi-directional road network, i.e. identifying divisions of the roads where the traffic flow is very dense. The proposed technique works in two phases: phase I, finds the clusters of trajectory points based on density of trajectory points; phase II, arranges the clusters in sequence based on spatiotemporal values for each route and directions. These sequences represent the traffic flow patterns. All the routes and sections exceeding a user specified minimum traffic threshold are marked as high dense traffic areas. The experiments are performed on synthetic dataset. The proposed algorithm efficiently and accurately finds the dense traffic in bi-directional roads. Proposed clustering method is compared with the standard k-means clustering algorithm for the performance evaluation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Data mining; Mobility mining; Traffic control; Traffic flow patterns mining; Trajectory patterns,Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Flow patterns; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Trajectories; Transportation; Wireless telecommunication systems; K-Means clustering algorithm; Machine learning communities; Mobility minings; Positioning technologies; Traffic flow patterns; Trajectory clustering; Trajectory pattern; Wireless communications; Street traffic control,"Mirge, V.; M M College of TechnologyIndia; email: vaishali_sarde@rediffmail.com",,Springer Verlag,18625347,,,,English,Adv.

We present a novel benefit of voting, that has not been observed before: we can use the voting patterns to assess the performance of a team and predict their final outcome. This prediction can be executed at any moment during problem-solving and it is completely domain independent. Hence, it can be used to identify when a team is failing, allowing an operator to take remedial procedures (such as changing team members, the voting rule, or increasing the allocation of resources). We present three main theoretical results: (1) we show a theoretical explanation of why our prediction method works; (2) contrary to what would be expected based on a simpler explanation using classical voting models, we show that we can make accurate predictions irrespective of the strength (i.e., performance) of the teams, and that in fact, the prediction can work better for diverse teams composed of different agents than uniform teams made of copies of the best agent; (3) we show that the quality of our prediction increases with the size of the action space. We perform extensive experimentation in two different domains: Computer Go and Ensemble Learning. In Computer Go, we obtain high quality predictions about the final outcome of games. We analyze the prediction accuracy for three different teams with different levels of diversity and strength, and show that the prediction works significantly better for a diverse team. Additionally, we show that our method still works well when trained with games against one adversary, but tested with games against another, showing the generality of the learned functions. Moreover, we evaluate four different board sizes, and experimentally confirm better predictions in larger board sizes. We analyze in detail the learned prediction functions, and how they change according to each team and action space size. In order to show that our method is domain independent, we also present results in Ensemble Learning, where we make online predictions about the performance of a team of classifiers, while they are voting to classify sets of items. We study a set of classical classification algorithms from machine learning, in a data-set of hand-written digits, and we are able to make high-quality predictions about the final performance of two different teams. Since our approach is domain independent, it can be easily applied to a variety of other domains. © 2016, The Author(s).",Collective intelligence; Distributed problem solving; Single and multiagent learning; Social choice theory; Teamwork,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer games; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Collective intelligences; Distributed problem solving; Multi-agent learning; Social choice theory; Teamwork; Problem solving,"Soriano Marcolino, L.; Lancaster University, LancasterUnited Kingdom; email: l.marcolino@lancaster.ac.uk",,Springer New York LLC,13872532,,,,English,Auton.

Despite the parallel and distributed ELM on MapReduce framework able to handle very large scale dataset for bigdata applications, the process of coping up with the rapidly updating data is a challenging one. Among the unified algorithms, the ELM with kernel uses kernels instead of random feature mappings. After, analyzing the property of ELM, it is observed that its most expensive computational part is matrix multiplication and matrix inversion. With the exponentially increasing volume of data, the matrix operations cannot be directly implemented on MapReduce. This paper proposes a novel approach, online sequential ELM with kernel (OS-ELM-Ker) based on sparsification criteria. Consequently, the efficient learning of frequently updated massive dataset is obtained. Based on the extensive experiments on synthetic dataset, it is observed that the proposed OS-ELM-Ker is highly efficient in classifying massive rapidly updated training dataset in terms of generalizations error and training time. © 2017 IEEE.",Bigdata; classification; ELM; MapReduce; Online sequential,Classification (of information); E-learning; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Bigdata; Extreme machine learning; Generalization performance; Large-scale dataset; Map-reduce; Mapreduce frameworks; MAtrix multiplication; Online sequential; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Due to availability of large number of choices to select a course from, learners might be uncomfortable to make a decision, about what would be more appropriate for them. In such Situations, recommender system can be helpful in making an appropriate course selection. This paper presents a recommender system based on the query classification approach towards recommending different courses to learner depend on his requirements and needs. Its aim is to provide personalized Course recommendations in a learner centered System. Based on this concept of personalization, our recommender system can tailor the needs of a learner as per their requirements. This way of personalization may improve the quality of research and learning experience by recommending courses which are otherwise overlooked by learners like researchers and scholars, as it is time consuming to go through the curriculum and finding the best match possible. Such recommendations can improve the quality of research, performance, and satisfaction during the completion of the course. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Query Classification based recommender system that supports learners in selecting the proper courses. Such recommendations intend to help learners in course selection and to gain most in terms of increasing their learning experience. © 2017 IEEE.",Ontology; Personalization; Recommendation System,Education; Ontology; Recommender systems; Best match; Learner-centered; Learner-centered approach; Learning experiences; Personalizations; Personalized course; Query classification; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Many authors have presented different versions of the churn prediction models greatly based on the data mining concepts employing the machine learning and meta-heuristic algorithms. This aim of this paper is to study some of the most important churn prediction techniques developed over the recent years. The primary objective is on the churn in telecom industries to accurately estimate the customer survival and customer hazard functions to gain the complete knowledge of churn over the customer tenure. Another objective is the identification of the customers who are at the blink of churn and approximating the time they will churn. This paper focuses on analyzing the churn prediction techniques to identify the churn behavior and validate the reasons for customer churn. This paper summarizes the churn prediction techniques in order to have a deeper understanding of the customer churn and it shows that most accurate churn prediction is given by the hybrid models rather than single algorithms so that telecom industries become aware of the needs of high risk customers and enhance their services to overturn the churn decision. © 2017 IEEE.,churn prediction; data mining; hybrid models; telecom industry,Data mining; Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Learning systems; Churn predictions; Customer churn prediction; Customer retention; Hybrid model; Meta heuristic algorithm; Primary objective; Telecom industry; Telecommunications industry; Sales,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The placement prediction is more complex when the complexity of educational entities increase. Educational institutes look for more efficient technology that assist better management and support decision making procedures or assist them to set new strategies. One of the effective ways to address the challenges for improving the quality is to provide new knowledge related to the educational processes and entities to the managerial system. With the machine learning techniques the knowledge can be extracted from operational and historical data that resides within the educational organization's databases using. The dataset for system implementation contains information about past data of students. These data are used for training the model for rule identification and for testing the model for classification. This paper presents a recommendation system that predicts the students to have one of the five placement statuses, viz., Dream Company, Core Company, Mass Recruiters, Not Eligible and Not Interested in Placements. This model helps the placement cell within an organization to identify the prospective students and pay attention to and improve their technical as well as interpersonal skills. Furthermore, the students in pre-final and final years of their B. Tech course can also use this system to know their individual placement status that they are most likely to achieve.

Feature selection plays a crucial role because of the huge dimensionality and less training and testing samples. Finding a small subset of significant genes from a large set of gene expression data is a challenging task. This paper presents the usage of genetic algorithm as a tool to determine the informative gene subset and uses Extreme Learning Machines classifier to determine the classifier accuracy.

One of the most common techniques used for the particular category of people (is e-learning, which is the best option for those people. They have some difficulties such as, learning, communication, understanding, etc. for providing a better learning environment; many existing e-learning mechanisms provide the recommendation of subjects based on their personalization. However, it makes the whole learning process as complex, and there is a need to collect the request from them, which are the major drawbacks of the existing scheme. To overcome the issues, a new type of web-based e-learning system, namely, Most Similar Most Frequent Recommendation (MSMFR) is proposed in this paper with query analyzing option for people, who using e-learning. The proposed system is entirely based on the data structures such as stack, queue, linked list, etc in the distributed environment. Here, the physically challenged people can able to share their recommended content to others, who search the same one. Moreover, we provide a secure access and provisioning for them. The primary intention of this paper is to improve the learning capability of physically challenged people. Initially, the required information is collected from the data owner and, the meta-data is created from that data. Then, the query is obtained from the user, which is parsed into attributes. Hence, the semantic relationship between the attributes and meta-data and the visiting frequency are found out. Here, the rating ratio is calculated for the requested query by using a web history. Finally, the required information such as web or video is retrieved.

The proposed intrusion detection system has a multi-support vector machine classifier with mutual information based feature selection technique to detect attacks in Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) of smart grid. Mutual information technique selects the input features of classifier by analyzing the relation between different features with attacks. The developed classifier is the integration of multiple support vector machine classifiers in which each classifier detect specific attack only. The performance of developed intrusion detection system is analyzed by training and testing the classifier with ADFA-LD dataset.

The question processing module helps in assigning a suitable question category and identifying the keywords from the given input question. A prototype system based on the proposed method has been constructed and the experiment on 500 medical questions collected from patients and doctors has been carried out. Using the two layered taxonomy of 6 course grain and 50 fine grained categories developed by Li and Roth, we have classified the questions into various categories. We have also studied the syntactic structure of the question and suggest the syntactic patterns for particular category of questions. Using these question patterns we have classified the question into particular category. In this paper we have proposed a compact and effective method for question classification.

The master wants to distribute these computations to untrusted workers who have volunteered or are incentivized to help with this task. However, the data must be kept private (in an information theoretic sense) and not revealed to the individual workers. The workers may be busy and will take a random time to finish the task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the aggregate delay experienced by the master. We focus on linear computations as an essential operation in many iterative algorithms. A known solution is to use a linear secret sharing scheme to divide the data into secret shares on which the workers can compute. We propose to use instead new secure codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the authors. We study the delay induced by Staircase codes which is always less than that of secret sharing. The reason is that secret sharing schemes need to wait for the responses of a fixed fraction of the workers, whereas Staircase codes offer more flexibility in this respect. For instance, for codes with rate R = 1/2 Staircase codes can lead to up to 40% reduction in delay compared to secret sharing. © 2017 IEEE.",,Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Stairs; Confidential data; Iterative algorithm; Linear computations; Linear secret sharing schemes; Medical data; Secret sharing; Secret sharing schemes; Secure codes; Information theory,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21578095,9.78151E+12,PISTF,,English,IEEE Int Symp Inf Theor Proc,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034034104

Redundant or superfluous features either slow down the training process or dilute the quality of classification. Many methods are available in literature for dimensionality reduction. Earlier studies explored a discernibility matrix (DM) based reduct calculation for dimensionality reduction. Discernibility matrix works only on discrete values. But most real-world datasets are continuous in nature. Use of traditional discernibility matrix approach inevitably incurs information loss due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a fuzzified adaptation of discernibility matrix with four variants of dissimilarity measure to deal with continuous data. The proposed algorithm has been applied on EEG dataset-III from BCI competition-II. The reduced dataset is then classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix (FDM) variants are compared with original discernibility matrix based method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Now day's DNN is playing major role in machine leaning technics. Recursive recurrent neural network (R2NN) is a best technic for machine learning. It is the combination of recurrent neural network and recursive neural network (such as Recursive auto encoder). This paper presents how to train the recurrent neural network for reordering for source to target language by using Semi-supervised learning methods. Word2vec tool is required to generate word vectors of source language and Auto encoder helps us in reconstruction of the vectors for target language in tree structure. Results of word2vec play an important role in word alignment of the input vectors. RNN structure is very complicated and to train the large data file on word2vec is also a time-consuming task. Hence, a powerful hardware support (GPU) is required.

Whatever we do, whatever we say, somehow does reflect some of our emotions, though may not be directly. To understand the very fundamental behavior of a human, we need to analyze these emotions through some emotional data, also called, the affect data. This data can be text, voice, facial expressions etc. Using this emotional data for analyzing the emotions also forms an interdisciplinary field, called Affective Computing. Computation of emotions is a very challenging task, much work has been done but many more increments are also possible. With the advent of social networking sites, many people tend to get attracted towards analyzing this very text available on these various sites.

One of the various multitask learning frameworks is the regularized convex minimization problem, for which many optimization techniques are available in the literature. In this paper, we consider solving the non-smooth convex minimization problem with sparsity-inducing regularizers for the multitask learning framework, which can be efficiently solved using proximal algorithms. Due to slow convergence of traditional proximal gradient methods, a recent trend is to introduce acceleration to these methods, which increases the speed of convergence. In this paper, we present a new accelerated gradient method for the multitask regression framework, which not only outperforms its non-accelerated counterpart and traditional accelerated proximal gradient method but also improves the prediction accuracy. We also prove the convergence and stability of the algorithm under few specific conditions.

Feature selection is typically employed to select a subset of features which improves generalization accuracy as well as reduces the computational cost of learning the model. One of the criteria used for feature selection is to jointly minimize the redundancy and maximize the relevance of the selected features. In this paper, we formulate the task of feature selection as a one class SVM problem in a space where features correspond to the data points and instances correspond to the dimensions. The goal is to look for a representative subset of the features (support vectors) which describes the boundary for the region where the set of the features (data points) exists. This leads to a joint optimization of relevance and redundancy in a principled max-margin framework. Additionally, our formulation enables us to leverage existing techniques for optimizing the SVM objective resulting in highly computationally efficient solutions for the task of feature selection. Specifically, we employ the dual coordinate descent algorithm (Hsieh et al., 2008), originally proposed for SVMs, for our formulation. We use a sparse representation to deal with data in very high dimensions. Experiments on seven publicly available benchmark datasets from a variety of domains show that our approach results in orders of magnitude faster solutions even while retaining the same level of accuracy compared to the state of the art feature selection techniques. © 2017",Feature selection; Max-Margin; One class SVM,Learning systems; Redundancy; Computationally efficient; Generalization accuracy; Machine learning applications; Max-Margin; One class-SVM; Relevance and redundancies; Selection techniques; Sparse representation; Feature extraction,"Prasad, Y.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, 110016, India; email: yprasad@cse.iitd.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1678655,,,,English,Pattern Recogn.

Thus, it has become a tough challenge to search for a particular document from such a large volume of collections. Text classification is a technique which can speed up the search and retrieval tasks and hence is the need of the hour. Aiming in this direction, this study proposes an efficient technique that uses the concept of connected component (CC) of a graph and Wordnet along with four established feature selection techniques [e.g., TF-IDF, Chi-square, Bi-Normal Separation (BNS) and Information Gain (IG)] to select the best features from a given input dataset in order to prepare an efficient training feature vector. Next, multilayer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) (which is based on the architecture of deep learning) and other state-of-the-art classifiers are trained on this efficient training feature vector for classification of text data. The experimental work has been carried out on DMOZ and 20-Newsgroups datasets. We have studied the behavior and compared the results of different classifiers using these four important feature selection techniques used for classification process and observed that ML-ELM achieved the maximum overall F-measure of 72.28 % on DMOZ dataset using TF-IDF as the feature selection technique and 81.53 % on 20-Newsgroups dataset using BNS as the feature selection technique compared to other state-of-the-art classifiers which signifies the usefulness of deep learning used by ML-ELM for classifying the text data.

DPPs define probability distributions over subsets of a given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative correlation, and, unlike other models of negative correlation such as Markov random fields, have efficient algorithms for sampling. When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on the sampled subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important from the viewpoint of ensuring priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs for machine learning by Kulesza and Taskar and studied in some recent works. The main contribution of this paper is the first resolution of the complexity of sampling from DPPs with constraints. On the one hand, we give exact efficient algorithms for sampling from constrained DPPs when the description of the constraints is in unary; this includes special cases of practical importance such as a small number of partition, knapsack or budget constraints. On the other hand, we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is #Phard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants; implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Technically, our algorithmic result benefits from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials and we obtain our complexity results by providing an equivalence between computing mixed discriminants and sampling from partition constrained DPPs. As a consequence, we obtain a few corollaries of independent interest: 1) An algorithm to count, sample (and, hence, optimize) over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct) budget constraints and, 2) An algorithm to evaluate and compute mixed characteristic polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem, for certain special cases. © L.

Typically, these analytics are a part of a comprehensive workflow, which includes data preparation, model building, and model evaluation. General-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks execute all steps of such workflows holistically. This holistic view enables these systems to reason about and automatically optimize the entire pipeline. Here, graph and machine learning analytics are known to incur a long runtime since they require multiple passes over the data until convergence is reached. Thus, fault tolerance and a fast-recovery from any intermittent failure is critical for efficient analysis. In this paper, we propose novel fault-tolerant mechanisms for graph and machine learning analytics that run on distributed dataflow systems. We seek to reduce checkpointing costs and shorten failure recovery times. For graph processing, rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, our mechanism writes checkpoints in an unblocking manner that does not break pipelined tasks. In contrast to the conventional approach for unblocking checkpointing (e.g., that manage checkpoints independently for immutable datasets), we inject the checkpoints of mutable datasets into the iterative dataflow itself. Hence, our mechanism is iteration-aware by design. This simplifies the system architecture and facilitates coordinating checkpoint creation during iterative graph processing. Moreover, we are able to rapidly rebound, via confined recovery, by exploiting the fact that log files exist locally on healthy nodes and managing to avoid a complete recomputation from scratch. In addition, we propose replica recovery for machine learning algorithms, whereby we employ a broadcast variable that enables us to quickly recover without having to introduce any checkpoints. In order to evaluate our fault tolerance strategies, we conduct both a theoretical study and experimental analyses using Apache Flink and discover that they outperform blocking checkpointing and complete recovery. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",distributed data processing; Fault tolerance; graph processing; iterative computation; machine learning analytics,Artificial intelligence; Data flow analysis; Data handling; Fault tolerance; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Recovery; Conventional approach; Distributed data flow; Distributed data processing; Experimental analysis; Fault-tolerant mechanism; Graph processing; Intermittent failure; Iterative computation; Pipeline processing systems,,,IEEE Computer Society,10414347,,ITKEE,,English,IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029114310

This paper presents and discusses several experiments using a variety of classifiers. The goal of this research is to determine the degree to which such postings can be authenticated as coming from the purported user and not from an intruder. Various sets of stylometry and ad hoc social networking features were developed to categorize 9259 posts from 30 Facebook authors as authentic or non-authentic. An algorithm to utilize machine-learning classifiers for investigating this problem is described, and an additional voting algorithm that combines three classifiers is investigated. This research is one of the first works that focused on authorship authentication in short messages, such as postings on social network sites. The challenges of applying traditional stylometry techniques on short messages are discussed. Experimental results demonstrate an average accuracy rate of 79.6% among 30 users. Further empirical analyses evaluate the effect of sample size, feature selection, user writing style, and classification method on authorship authentication, indicating varying degrees of success compared with previous studies.

In the presence of fresh and formerly unknown activities, intrusion detection rate is inaccurate and low. Many research works are focused in this area. In all the security infrastructures, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have grown a standard and in separable component. For this reason, a new model has been proposed based on Big Data for detecting unknown attacks. The core idea of this paper is to analyze the activity of the network users, and to classify whether the user is normal or anomaly. For implementation of this project, we have used the snort, the tools which are used to capture the online behavior of network users. After collecting the network behavior, the dataset was analyzed with hadoop framework using C4.5 classification. The performance of the project was compared with KDD Dataset.

However, the traditional content-based methods for spam detection degraded in performance due to many factors. For instance, unlike the contents posted on social networks like Facebook and Renren, SMS and microblogging messages have limited size with the presence of many domain specific words, such as idioms and abbreviations. In addition, microblogging messages are very unstructured and noisy. These distinguished characteristics posed challenges to existing email spam detection models for effective spam identification in short message communication media. The state-of-the-art solutions for social spam accounts detection have faced different evasion tactics in the hands of intelligent spammers. In this paper, a unified framework is proposed for both spam message and spam account detection tasks. We utilized four datasets in this study, two of which are from SMS spam message domain and the remaining two from Twitter microblog. To identify a minimal number of features for spam account detection on Twitter, this paper studied bio-inspired evolutionary search method. Using evolutionary search algorithm, a compact model for spam account detection is proposed, which is incorporated in the machine learning phase of the unified framework. The results of the various experiments conducted indicate that the proposed framework is promising for detecting both spam message and spam account with a minimal number of features. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Evolutionary computation; Machine learning; Microblog; Online social network; Spam account; Spam message,Artificial intelligence; Education; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Content-based methods; Evolutionary search; Evolutionary search algorithms; Micro-blog; On-line social networks; Spam account; Spam identification; Spam messages; Social networking (online),"Adewole, K.S.; Faculty of Communication and Information Sciences, University of IlorinNigeria; email: adewole.ks@siswa.um.edu.my",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025430846

In this paper, our motive is to develop a recommender system that is based on user assigned tags and content present on web pages. Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation. © 2017 IEEE.",K-NN; Privacy; recall; Recommender Systems; Social; Tag,Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Data privacy; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; User interfaces; Websites; K-nearest neighbours; Quality of recommendations; recall; Social; Social tagging systems; Supervised machine learning; Tag recommendations; Tag recommender systems; Recommender systems,,Qiu M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. -IEEE Int.

An entire industry of black-market services has emerged which offers fake accounts based services for sale. We, therefore, in our work, focus on detecting fake accounts on a very popular (and difficult for data collection) online social network, Facebook. Key contributions of our work are as follows. The first contribution has been collection of data related to real and fake accounts on Facebook. Due to strict privacy settings and ever evolving API of Facebook with each version adding more restrictions, collecting user accounts data became a major challenge. Our second contribution is the use of user-feed information on Facebook to understand user profile activity and identifying an extensive set of 17 features which play a key role in discriminating fake users on Facebook with real users. Third contribution is the use these features and identifying the key machine learning based classifiers who perform well in detection task out of a total of 12 classifiers employed. Fourth contribution is the identifying which type of activities (like, comment, tagging, sharing, etc) contribute the most in fake user detection. Results exhibit classification accuracy of 79% among the best performing classifiers. In terms of activities, likes and comments contribute well towards detection task.

Watermark bits are embedded into small blocks of low-pass frequency sub-band using quantization of minimum and maximum coefficients of the corresponding blocks. And, to extract the watermark, DSR based coefficient enhancement process is incorporated. A features set of enhanced block coefficients is generated by employing different statistical parameters, and principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensions of the features set, which are used for training and testing the learning machine. Training and testing patterns are generated using concatenation of reduced features with enhanced coefficients of the corresponding blocks.

Several existing anti-malware defensive solutions detect known malware accurately. However, they fail to recognize unseen malware, since most of them rely on signature-based techniques, which are easily evadable using obfuscation or polymorphism technique. Therefore, there is immediate requirement of new techniques that can detect and classify the new malwares. In this context, heuristic analysis is found to be promising, since it is capable of detecting unknown malwares and new variants of current malwares. The N-Gram extraction technique is one such heuristic method commonly used in malware detection. Previous works have witnessed that shorter length N-Grams are easier to extract. In order to identify and remove noisy N-Grams, a popular Feature Selection Technique (FST), namely, Information Gain (IG), which computes score for each N-Gram (feature) in the dataset has been used in this work. N-Grams with the highest IG score are considered as best features, while the remaining N-Grams are neglected. The IG-FST (Information Gain-Feature Selection Technique) is computational resource demanding and takes time to generate IG scores for larger N-Gram datasets, if the processing is to be accomplished in the sequential mode. To address this issue, the present work presents a multiprocessing model that computes IG scores rapidly for larger N-Gram datasets. The proposed model has been designed, implemented, and compared with the sequential mode of IG score computation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multiprocessing model performance is 80% faster than the sequential model of IG score computation. © 2017 IEEE.",Information Gain; Machine Learning; Malware Detection; N-Grams,Computer crime; Feature extraction; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Network security; Computational resources; Extraction techniques; Heuristic analysis; Information gain; Malware detection; N-grams; Network security solutions; Selection techniques; Malware,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"ISEA Asia Secur.

Weeds cause decrease in farm and forest yield, invade crops and they can also harm livestock. The only solution to this problem is to avoid the growth of weeds either by removing them or using herbicides. In this proposed automated idea, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is utilized to make out whether plant is crop or weed. The maize crops are continuously monitored by capturing images using camera. In order to classify a plant as a crop or weed, various features are extricated which among them are shape, texture, color. We have made use of statistical textural features such as Intensity, Mean, Energy, Entropy, Standard Deviation, Smoothness and Third Moment. Machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is used for accurate prediction to find out whether the plant is crop or weed. The data-set consists of images of maize crop which are 500 in number and equal number of weed images.

Sentiment analysis has proved to be quite useful in determining the collective response of people on any issue by analysing their opinions which are generally in the form of written texts. However, human beings do not understand numbers but language. So, we use the mathematical technique of perceptual computing to provide a mapping between numeric and linguistic data to generate recommendations. It is based on Zadeh's computing with words (CWW). However, to generate recommendations from perceptual computing, we need problem specific linguistic terms and their associated interval values. Obtaining interval values may not be possible in scenarios where the number of subjects available for providing feedback is very less.

The traditional security systems like Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System and Anti-Virus (AV) software are not able to detect unknown malware as they use signature based methods. In order to solve this issue, static and dynamic malware analysis is being used along with machine learning algorithms for malware detection and classification. The main problems with these systems is that they have high false positive and false negative rate and the process of building classification model takes time (due to large feature set) which hinders the early detection of malware. Thus, the challenge is to select a relevant set of features, so that, the classification model can be built in less time with high accuracy. In this paper, we present a system that addresses both the issues mentioned above. It uses an integration of both static and dynamic analysis features of malware binaries incorporated with machine learning process for detecting zero-day malware. The proposed model is tested and validated on a real-world corpus of malicious samples.

There are cases wherein the data which is important or unidentified is missed during the process of classification. The process of mining is highly affected by the absence of such kind of data. The process of extraction of unknown and new data from the huge dataset that has been left during the classification process is known as novelty detection.

Our approach is machine-learning based which makes use of a behaviour knowledge space. This technique can be used in photographs having two or more people. To achieve forgery detection, complementary illuminant estimators are incorporated on image regions of similar material.

Many times an analyst may end up with an erroneous classifier because of huge, redundant, unreliable and noisy data. It may also be due to misinterpretation of results and usage of inappropriate techniques for a specific situation. In our study, we have investigated the two main approaches in data mining which are Decision Tree (J48 algorithm) and Ensemble Learning Technique (AdaBoost). We have also performed a comparative analysis of these two techniques. The tool which we have used is WEKA which is an open source's software. The datasets which we have used are supermarket.arff, labor.arff, soybean.arff, & segment.arff. Here. arff is an abbreviation of Attribute Relation file Format which is the standard format that is accepted by WEKA for the datasets. The sample size of training set is number of attributes and number of instances available in the dataset. Classification models are assessed on the basis of number of class labels in the dataset, accuracy, amount and length of the generated rules, error rate and standard deviation. Based on number of experiments which we have performed, results show that AdaBoost provides better accuracy than Decision Tree (J48 algorithm) when the number of class labels in the dataset are exactly two whereas the Decision Tree generate rules faster than the Adaboost and when number of class labels in the dataset are more than two then J48 algorithm performs better than Adaboost. The results show the tradeoff of using the two approaches for other researchers in finding the best model for a particular problem. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Decision Tree,Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Open source software; Open systems; Trees (mathematics); Classification models; Comparative analysis; Ensemble learning; Machine learning techniques; Number of class; Standard deviation; Standard format; Training sets; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"India Int.

The effective countermeasure against such botnet is provided by IDS (Intrusion detection system). IDS regularly observes and identify the presence of active attack by inspecting the vulnerabilities in network traffic. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) recognizes active intrusion efforts by examining user datagram protocol packet (UDP) and transmission control protocol's (TCP) payload and matching it with known attacks but the technique of PI-IDS is undermined if the packet is encrypted. The shortcoming of the PI-IDS is overcome by Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS), it does not check the packet payload; instead of this, it examines the header of a packet to classify the intrusion, but this technique is not suitable in today's world because network traffic grows rapidly so to check the header of each packet is not efficient and due to this detection rate also critical. So, We propose the new method in this paper T-IDS built an RDPLM (randomized data partitioned learning model) that depend on features set, and technique for feature selection, simplified sub spacing and multiple randomized meta-learning techniques.

Hence, to capture this dynamic behavior, dynamic metrics are necessary to be evaluated. This paper presents the empirical investigation of dynamic metrics for SMP and also compares them with static metrics. Six machine learning algorithms are used to build the prediction models for both the static and dynamic metrics. The performance of all models is compared using prevalent accuracy measures.

Detecting spams or spammers on twitter has become a recent area of research in social network. However, we present a method based on two new aspects: the identification of spam-tweets without knowing previous background of the user; and the other based on analysis of language for detecting spam on twitter in such topics that are in trending at that time. Trending topics are the topics of discussion that are popular at that time. This growing micro blogging phenomenon therefore benefits spammers. Our work tries to detect spam tweets in based on language tools. We first collected the tweets related to many trending topics, labelling them on the basis of their content which is either malicious or safe. After a labelling process we extracted a many features based on the language models using language as a tool. We also evaluate the performance and classify tweets as spam or not spam. Thus our system can be applied for detecting spam on Twitter, focusing mainly on analysing of tweets instead of the user accounts. © 2017 IEEE.",Machine learning; Social network; Spam detection; Statistical natural language processing,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Integrated approach; Language model; Language tools; Micro blogging; Spam detection; Spammers; Statistical natural language processing; Trending topics; Natural language processing systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Critical issues like increasing domestic energy usage, if addressed via machine learning techniques in current IOT devices will tremendously help humans in unimaginable ways. The concern of price hikes in energy and the adverse effects on the environment due to inefficient energy usage is a subject that concerns a larger segment of the population. Human behavior plays an important role in energy expenditure. Markets shall never cease to flood with electronic gadgets and humans shall never cease to fancy the upcoming ones that majorly contributes to increasing energy consumption. So we propose a framework with load optimization strategy that shall be responsive to realtime pricing which will exclude frequent human intervention. The load will be optimized during the times of high pricing or when the total power consumption of the household exceeds the maximum constraint. However, Optimal Load Management strategy requires price prediction that can be generated using real-Time price algorithm and human activity prediction to ensure discrete decision making. This paper proposes an idea to mitigate energy consumption by modeling human behavior via a combination of Hidden Markov Model and Naive Bayes classifier. Also, we try to minimize the errors generated due to motion/occupancy sensors while detecting a human or an animal(pet). Sometimes activation of motion sensors can result in the wrong detection which can further lead to incorrect activity recognition which then can generate errors in optimizing loads. Therefore, we integrate classification algorithms in our framework which can further aid in correct detection and subsequent strategy generation. © 2016 IEEE.",Demand side management; hidden Markov model (HMM); human behavior; Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC); Optimum Load Management strategy; Real time pricing; Smart home energy management systems,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Behavioral research; Chemical detection; Classifiers; Costs; Decision making; Demand side management; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy utilization; Hidden Markov models; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Optimization; Process control; Real time systems; Social sciences; Human behaviors; Naive Bayes classifiers; Optimum loads; Real time pricing; Smart home energy management systems; Energy management systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is easy, convenient and trendy to make payments and other transactions. Credit card fraud is also growing along with the development in technology. It can also be said that economic fraud is drastically increasing in the global communication improvement. It is being recorded every year that the loss due to these fraudulent acts is billions of dollars. These activities are carried out so elegantly so it is similar to genuine transactions. Hence simple pattern related techniques and other less complex methods are really not going to work. Having an efficient method of fraud detection has become a need for all banks in order to minimize chaos and bring order in place. There are several techniques like Machine learning, Genetic Programming, fuzzy logic, sequence alignment, etc are used for detecting credit card fraudulent transactions. Along with these techniques, KNN algorithm and outlier detection methods are implemented to optimize the best solution for the fraud detection problem. These approaches are proved to minimize the false alarm rates and increase the fraud detection rate.

Abdur Rahman University, Chennai, India","As per the reports published by World Health Organization (WHO) in November, 2012, every year more than 15 million babies are born preterm and this number is rising [1]. Preterm labor is the major cause of neonatal deaths. Every year, pre term birth (PTB) complications leads to the death of almost 1 million babies [2][3]. Predicting the preterm labor well in advance can reduce the neonatal death considerably. There are some commonly attributed risk factors associated with preterm birth [4][5]. 33% of the women who deliver their babies prematurely have one or more of these risk factors. We propose to predict PTB by analyzing the historical data of patients who had one or more of the above risk factors. In addition to this, historic data of the patients who did not have any of the above risk factors but had PTB is also analyzed. Electrohysterogram (EHG) is the most commonly used clinical procedure which can reveal few indicators of preterm labor [6]. We analyze the EHG signals to predict the pre term labor by applying Feature Extraction coupled with semi-supervised learning (SSL). Predicting the preterm labor helps the health care professionals to make decisions about the treatment [7]. Hence the expectant mother undergoes minimal or no complications of preterm labor.

Nowadays consumer can gain knowledge about the products and service from online review resources, using which they can make decisions. This may lead to Opinion Spam, where spammers may manipulate and fake reviews to promote artificially or devalue the products and other services. Opinion spam detection is done by extracting meaningful features from the text, and identifying the spam reviews using machine learning techniques. This representation results in a very high dimensional feature space. These features are irrelevant, redundant, and noisy which may affect the performance of the classifier. Therefore, a good feature selection method is needed in order to speed up the processing rate, predictive accuracy. Evolutionary algorithms for feature selection can be used to handle these high-dimensional feature spaces which eliminate the noisy and irrelevant features. In this work, an effective hybrid feature selection technique using Cuckoo Search with Harmony search is proposed and Naive Bayes is used for classifying the review into spam and ham. © 2017 IEEE.",Cuckoo search and Harmony search; Feature Selection; Review Spam Detection,Learning systems; Optimization; Feature selection methods; Harmony search; High-dimensional feature space; Hybrid feature selections; Machine learning techniques; Predictive accuracy; Products and services; Review spam; Feature extraction,,Ramesh P.L.N.Moorthi M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The users will be eagerly using these data for the future purpose and get information about the opinions of others thus there is a need of automatic summarization of opinion of the web users. Opinion Mining is a process of extracting and analyzing people's opinion regarding the given object and Sentiment Analysis explains about the hidden sentiments in the opinions. A most important challenge in this is to identify the sentiments and aspects and then perform the data classification based on these features and this process is called aspect based feature extraction. Opinion summarization can be done using machine learning such as maximum entropy, naive bayes, Support vector machine (SVM) model and, Random forest technique.

A myriad of military bases, temporary campaigns, base camps etc. are being targeted and attacked by several terrorist forces. The common problem in the warfare and tumultuous international borders is the frequent and violent intrusion and breaches upon the temporary / permanent military and army bases. Though they are successful in their individual task to identify the safest or the effective base, a combined location that embraces both effectiveness and vulnerability is invalid using a present analyzing and classification technology. This problem is due to the presence of collinearity between the parameters that determine both effectiveness and vulnerability. A military base location can be both effective and vulnerable at the same time, a location that does not provide sufficient effectiveness to perform military operation. To combat this problem, in this paper we propose an algorithm that identifies the two rival parameters (effectiveness and vulnerability) and cross correlates them one by one for checking collinearity between them. Additionally, after identifying the collinear combinations, the Rival Check Cross Correlation Algorithm eliminates those collinear combinations, thereby providing unambiguous combinations of effective variables. © 2017 IEEE.",Collinearity; Component Analysis; Cross Correlator; Supervised Classification; Vulnerability,Fighter aircraft; Learning systems; Location; Military bases; Military operations; Terrorism; Collinearity; Component analysis; Cross correlators; Supervised classification; Vulnerability; Supervised learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Common classifiers when trained by imbalanced data tend to bias towards the class possessing bulk instances causing misclassification of upcoming patterns/instances. The study reveals that presence of redundant borderline instances and outliers in the data-space severely catalyzes the effect of class imbalance. The Condensed Nearest Neighbor and Tomek-link undersampling techniques are used as the baseline systems for the present study, and an improved undersampling algorithm is proposed to be employed in the pre-processing stage by amalgamating aspects of outlier and redundancy detection to the baseline system. The proposed scheme imparts to detect outlier, redundant and noisy instances having least contribution in estimating accurate class labels. Thus, a data-level solution has been offered to the concerned problem with novelty in effective elimination of majority instances without losing valuable information. The proposed scheme is implemented and validated with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), K-Nearest-Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers for 10 real-life datasets.

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other HE-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Annotation; boundaries; dataset; deep learning; nuclear segmentation; nuclei,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Object recognition; Pathology; Quality control; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Tissue; Annotation; dataset; Image processing technique; nuclei; Publicly accessible; Segmentation results; Segmentation techniques; Watershed segmentation; Image segmentation; algorithm; cell nucleus; human; image processing; machine learning; staining; Algorithms; Cell Nucleus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Staining and Labeling","Kumar, N.; IIT GuwahatiIndia; email: neeraj.kumar.iitg@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2780062,,ITMID,28287963,English,IEEE Trans.

While the current approaches have reported high accuracies at equal error rates, performance at lower false accept rates requires significant improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel face verification algorithm, which starts with selecting feature-rich frames from a video sequence using discrete wavelet transform and entropy computation. Frame selection is followed by representation learning-based feature extraction, where three contributions are presented: 1) deep learning architecture, which is a combination of stacked denoising sparse autoencoder (SDAE) and deep Boltzmann machine (DBM); 2) formulation for joint representation in an autoencoder; and 3) updating the loss function of DBM by including sparse and low rank regularization. Finally, a multilayer neural network is used as the classifier to obtain the verification decision. The results are demonstrated on two publicly available databases, YouTube Faces and Point and Shoot Challenge. Experimental analysis suggests that: 1) the proposed feature-richness-based frame selection offers noticeable and consistent performance improvement compared with frontal only frames, random frames, or frame selection using perceptual no-reference image quality measures and 2) joint feature learning in SDAE and sparse and low rank regularization in DBM helps in improving face verification performance. On the benchmark Point and Shoot Challenge database, the algorithm yields the verification accuracy of over 97% at 1% false accept rate whereas, on the YouTube Faces database, over 95% verification accuracy is observed at equal error rate. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",autoencoder; deep Boltzmann machine; Deep learning; face recognition; frame selection,Database systems; Deep learning; Discrete wavelet transforms; Feature extraction; Image quality; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Security systems; Wavelet transforms; Auto encoders; Consistent performance; Deep boltzmann machines; Experimental analysis; Face verification algorithms; Frame selection; Learning architectures; Learning-based feature extractions; Face recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15566013,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources.

Specifically, we study the Space Cover problem, where we are given a matrix M and a subset of its columns T; the task is to find a minimum set F of columns of M disjoint with T such that that the linear span of F contains all vectors of T. This is a fundamental problem arising in different domains, such as coding theory, machine learning, and graph algorithms. We give a parameterized algorithm with running time 2O(k) · ||M||O(1) solving this problem in the case when M is a totally unimodular matrix over rationals, where k is the size of F. In other words, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the rank of the covering subspace. The algorithm is ""asymptotically optimal"" for the following reasons. Choice of matrices: Vector matroids corresponding to totally unimodular matrices over rationals are exactly the regular matroids. It is known that for matrices corresponding to a more general class of matroids, namely, binary matroids, the problem becomes W[1]-hard being parameterized by k. Choice of the parameter: The problem is NP-hard even if |T| = 3 on matrix-representations of a subclass of regular matroids, namely cographic matroids. Thus for a stronger parameterization, like by the size of T, the problem becomes intractable. Running Time: The exponential dependence in the running time of our algorithm cannot be asymptotically improved unless Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our algorithm exploits the classical decomposition theorem of Seymour for regular matroids. © Fedor V. Fomin, Petr A.

Being able to track the location of a Wi-Fi or Radio Frequency Identification device could improve the quality of services in various sectors, including security, warehouse, logistic management, and healthcare. As compared with outdoor environment, positioning systems face a greater challenge in indoor environment because wireless signal is significantly influenced by building layout and surrounding objects, for which a location fingerprinting approach is needed. Moreover, the signal strength of a wireless device may also change over time, which is known as temporal variation, and therefore a reliable location estimation system must have the ability to learn and adapt with temporal changes. However, if the learning process is highly complex and requires long processing time, deploying the system into a larger scale would not be feasible. In recent years, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has surfaced as a viable alternative that challenged the norm of iterative and progressive learning. ELM has also been considered as a solution for indoor location fingerprinting. However, there has not been a comprehensive review on how the ELM-based approaches are linked with existing location fingerprinting techniques. Here we discuss some major location fingerprinting techniques, which are nearest-neighbor, LANDMARC, and LEMT, and formulate a new framework for systematically translating the techniques into ELM-based methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",ELM; Location fingerprinting; Signal strength; Temporal variation,Building signal systems; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Location; Radio; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Extreme learning machine; Location estimation; Location finger printings; Logistic management; Progressive learning; Radio frequency identification devices; Signal strengths; Temporal variation; Mobile computing,"Dwiyasa, F.; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological UniversitySingapore; email: felis001@e.ntu.edu.sg",,Springer New York LLC,9236082,,MUSPE,,English,Multidimens Syst Signal Proc,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963636167

The seminal paper of stacked denoising autoencoders have shown that robust deep models can be learnt when noisy data is used for training stacked autoencoders instead of clean data.

We are proposing a novel end-to-end deep learning based framework for image super-resolution. This framework simultaneously calculates the convolutional features of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image patches and learns the non-linear function that maps these convolutional features of LR image patches to their corresponding HR image patches convolutional features. Here, proposed deep learning based image super-resolution architecture is termed as coupled deep convolutional auto-encoder (CDCA) which provides state-of-the-art results. Super-resolution of a noisy/distorted LR images results in noisy/distorted HR images, as super-resolution process gives rise to spatial correlation in the noise, and further, it cannot be de-noised successfully. Traditional noise resilient image super-resolution methods utilize a de-noising algorithm prior to super-resolution but de-noising process gives rise to loss of some high-frequency information (edges and texture details) and super-resolution of the resultant image provides HR image with missing edges and texture information. We are also proposing a novel end-to-end deep learning based framework to obtain noise resilient image super-resolution. Proposed end-to-end deep learning based framework for noise resilient super-resolution simultaneously perform image de-noising and super-resolution as well as preserves textural details. First, stacked sparse de-noising auto-encoder (SSDA) was learned for LR image de-noising and proposed CDCA was learned for image superresolution. Then, both image de-noising and super-resolution networks were cascaded. This cascaded deep learning network was employed as one integral network where pre-trained weights were serving as initial weights. The integral network was end-to-end trained or fine-tuned on a database having noisy, LR image as an input and target as an HR image. In fine-tuning, all layers of the combined end-to-end network was jointly optimized to perform image de-noising and super-resolution simultaneously.

Application of unsupervised classification by Extreme learning machine is addressed for ElectroCardiogram (ECG) heart-beat time series clustering by a hybrid of Extreme learning machine and Decision rule using full heart-beat time series by alignment of R-peaks of all beats is proposed in this work. PQRST Time series of heart-beats having converted into equal length series by alignment of R-peaks of all heart-beats based on R-peak of largest length PQRST series in the data and by padding zeroes to the smaller length series on either side, was used in this experimentation. The main objective of this paper is to identify the abnormalities in ECG heart beats based on AAMI Categorization. Because of the large patient specific characteristics in ECG heartbeat morphology across individuals, the supervised methods trained on some ECG dataset may decrease performance on other datasets. In addition, these techniques require a considerable amount of known and labelled heartbeats which are not feasible in long-term ECG monitoring.

Thereafter signaldecomposition has been carried out using wavelet transform toextract a set of statistical features. Further feature extraction is usedto diminish the element of the huge data set. To enhance thecorrectness and reduce the computational burden, feature selection technique (forward feature selection) is implemented where the prime features are collected and the redundant features are removed as ofthe whole feature set.

RDDL is suitable for learning representations from signals corrupted with sparse but large outliers such as artifacts and noise that are more heavy tailed than Gaussian distributions. Such outliers are common in biomedical signals e.g. EEG and ECG. RDDL learns multiple levels of non-linear dictionaries for representing the data. Instead of the standard Euclidean cost function that is usually employed in dictionary learning, we propose a robust l1-norm cost function. In order to achieve sparse representation, an l1-norm is imposed on the learned representation. The 'depth' arises from the fact that multiple levels of dictionaries are learnt. The full formulation is solved in a greedy fashion, one layer at a time. To study the extent of usefulness of RDDL, we first benchmark it with two wellknown deep learning tools - the stacked denoising autoencoder and the deep belief network methods; experiments are carried out on benchmark deep learning datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. In all cases, our method yields the best results. Then the proposed method is used for learning representations of ECG data (containing arficacts) and for their classification using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia classification database. We compare it with traditional techniques as well as on deep learning tools. Our method yields the best results. © 2017 IEEE.",Deep learning; Dictionary learning; ECG classification; Robust estimation,Bioelectric phenomena; Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Cost functions; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Learning systems; Statistics; Arrhythmia classification; Biomedical signal; Deep belief networks; Dictionary learning; Ecg classifications; Robust estimation; Sparse representation; Traditional techniques; Deep learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,85OFA,,English,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030984741

With an average verification accuracy of 64.79% by human participants, the results of the cognitive analysis depict that the performance of female participants is significantly higher than the male participants with respect to imposter pairs. The results of the neuro-imaging analysis identifies regions of the brain such as the left fusiform gyrus, caudate nucleus, and superior frontal gyrus that are activated when participants perform face verification tasks. The second part of the paper proposes a novel two-level fMRI dictionary learning approach to predict if the stimuli observed is genuine or imposter using the brain activation data for selected regions.

A small subset of machine learning algorithms, called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are considered as state-ofthe-A rt for many applications (e.g. video/audio classification). The main challenge in implementing the CNNs, in embedded systems, is their large computation, memory, and bandwidth requirements. To meet these demands, dedicated hardware accelerators have been proposed. Since memory is the major cost in CNNs, recent accelerators focus on reducing the memory accesses. In particular, they exploit data locality using either tiling, layer merging or intra/inter feature map parallelism to reduce the memory footprint. However, they lack the flexibility to interleave or cascade these optimizations. Moreover, most of the existing accelerators do not exploit compression that can simultaneously reduce memory requirements, increase the throughput, and enhance the energy efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we present a flexible accelerator called MOCHA. MOCHA has three features that differentiate it from the state-of-the-art: (i) the ability to compress input/kernels, (ii) the flexibility to interleave various optimizations, and (iii) intelligence to automatically interleave and cascade the optimizations, depending on the dimension of a specific CNN layer and available resources. Post layout Synthesis results reveal that MOCHA provides up to 63% higher energy efficiency, up to 42% higher throughput, and up to 30% less storage, compared to the next best accelerator, at the cost of 26-35% additional area. © 2017 IEEE.",Accelerators; Computer architecture; Convolutional Neural Networks; Reconfigurable computing,Acceleration; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Convolution; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Neural networks; Particle accelerators; Reconfigurable architectures; Bandwidth requirement; Convolutional neural network; Dedicated hardware; Layout synthesis; Memory footprint; Memory requirements; Reconfigurable computing; State of the art; Network architecture,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The automated process identifies the significant regions in an image for feature extraction. It not only improves the dimension of useful features but also contributes to increased classification results compared to earlier approaches. The reduction in number of one kind of features easily makes space for the inclusion of other features whose fusion facilitates improved classification performance compared to individual feature extraction techniques. Two different datasets, i.e. Wang dataset and Corel 5K dataset have been used for the experiments.

Dengue outbreak is caused by improper maintenance of water storages, lack of urbanization, deforestation, lack of vaccination and awareness. Moreover, a number of dengue cases are varying based on climate season. There is a need to develop the prediction model for modeling the dengue outbreak based climate change. To model the dengue outbreak, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is applied in this paper that uses the seasonal average of various climate parameters such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, wind, relative humidity and solar. The number of dengue cases and climate data for each block of Tamil Nadu, India are collected from Integrated Disease Surveillance Project and Global Weather Data for SWAT Inc respectively. Local Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation is used in this paper for geographical visualization of hotspot regions. The outbreak of dengue and its hot spot regions are geographically visualized with the help of ArcGIS 10.1 software. The day wise big climate data is collected and stored in the Hadoop cluster computing environment. MapReduce framework is used to reduce the day wise climate data into seasonal climate averages such as winter, summer, and monsoon. The seasonal climate data and number of dengue incidence (health data) are integrated based on the geo-location (latitude and longitude). GPR is used to develop the prediction model for dengue based on the integrated data (climate and health data).

If recent trends are allowed to continue, 23.6 million people will die from heart disease in coming 2030. The healthcare industry collects large amounts of heart disease data which unfortunately are not 'mined' to discover hidden information for effective decision making. In this paper, study of PCA has been done which finds the minimum number of attributes required to enhance the precision of various supervised machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this research is to study supervised machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease. Data mining has number of important techniques like categorization, preprocessing. Diabetic is a life threatening disease which prevent in several urbanized as well as emergent countries like India. The data categorization is diabetic patients datasets which is developed by collecting data from hospital repository consists of 1865 instances with dissimilar attributes. The examples in the dataset are two categories of blood tests, urine tests. In this research paper we discuss a variety of algorithm approaches of data mining that have been utilized for diabetic disease prediction.

The advanced machine-learning algorithm called the Optimized Radial Basis Neural Network (ORBNN) method is developed in which the Neural Network uses Radial Basis function as the activation function. So in this paper the faulty condition of switch is identified using the neural network. Matlab based implementation is carried out using the neural network and means square error is minimized by using radial basis function neural network, trained with parameter optimization techniques gives better results. The fault diagnosis is carried out on a 7-level cascaded H-bridge inverter using neural network trained with Back-Propagation (BP), and optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA). The parameter chosen for the optimization is Mean Square Error(MSE), which has been minimized for the neural network and the radial basis neural network using different optimization algorithm as mentioned above. Matlab based simulation inferred that radial basis neural network performed better than the ordinary neural network and the CSA optimized radial basis neural network (ORBNN) delivered the lowest MSE concluding itself as the best method among the methods taken for analysis. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Cuckoo Search Algorithm; Genetic Algorithm; Particle Swarm Optimization; Radial Basis Network,Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Education; Electric inverters; Evolutionary algorithms; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; MATLAB; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Cascaded H-bridge inverters; Cuckoo search algorithms; Optimization techniques; Parameter optimization techniques; Performance enhancements; Radial basis function neural networks; Radial basis networks; Radial basis neural networks; Optimization,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

At that time, it was used in Maharashtra to prepare the documents such as Property matters, Donation of Land (Dan-Patra), Land Revenue, Military orders (Farman), Justice, Religious matters, Jahagir vatan, Judiciary, etc. In this research, Analysis of the MODI script is studied. Identification and Recognition of the handwritten MODI characters are performed. The database of handwritten samples is prepared by using ANESP program. The original manuscript of MODI script is collected and it is preprocessed. Moment Invariant and Affine Moment Invariant are the two techniques which are used for extracting the features from the handwritten segregated samples. Identification and recognition is done using machine learning technique. Among the variants of machine learning techniques, support vector machine is used as a classifier. Linear kernel function is applied in this support vector machine while performing classification. This system provides good recognition rate for the handwritten samples of MODI script.

The cleansing and labeling of data each time needs a considerable amount of human effort, and is time consuming.

In the proposed technique we take a small amount of labeled data to create model and using this model we show how to predict the unlabeled traffic.

It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 millions. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Non-motor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that this models can be used for early prediction of Parkinson's disease. © 2016 IEEE.",BayesNet; Biomarkers; Boosted Logistic Regression; Improved Accuracy; Machine Learning Techniques; Multilayer Per-ceptron; Non Motor Features; Prediction of Parkinson's Disease,Artificial intelligence; Biomarkers; Decision trees; Education; Embedded systems; Eye movements; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multilayers; Neurodegenerative diseases; Patient treatment; Regression analysis; Signal processing; BayesNet; Improved Accuracy; Logistic regressions; Machine learning techniques; Non Motor Features; Parkinson's disease; Diagnosis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Recently a few works have explored applicability of machine learning techniques to this problem. However, the challenging task of accurately finding the position depends on prior efforts of fingerprinting. Another challenge is that, distance sensitivity of signal strength depends on proximity to the access point. Heterogeneity of devices adds new dimension to the challenge. Existing solutions mostly aim at fingerprinting under the set of conditions considered so that training and test data can be taken under similar experimental setup. In this paper, an ensemble of condition based classifiers are designed for indoor localization that handles device heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity and context heterogeneity (door and window open/close, presence/absence of other users in vicinity). We have created an indoor localization data set where data is collected in above mentioned dimensions. When the training and test data sets are taken under similar environmental conditions with same devices, the average classification accuracy ranges between 72.2% to 92.6%. But for a validation set which contains examples for every conditions, the classifiers achieve an average maximum accuracy of 74.8% when individual training set corresponding to specific conditions are used. To avoid these conditional dependencies we have used an ensemble of condition specific K-nearest neighbour classifiers which enables us to predict the location with 96% accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.",Ensemble classifier; Indoor localization; Machine learning; RSSI; Wi-Fi,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Education; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Nearest neighbor search; Wi-Fi; Classification accuracy; Ensemble classifiers; Environmental conditions; Indoor localization; Machine learning techniques; Radio frequency fingerprinting; RSSI; Temporal heterogeneities; Indoor positioning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Gender classification plays an important role in developing different applications like guided navigation system that helps the customer to find different shops in a big shopping mall or to find different departments in a hospital on the basis of their gender. We have tested different classifiers (SVM-Linear, SVM-RBF, Artificial Neural Network, Linear Discriminate Analysis, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) on our dataset, consisting of a total 8 hours of seismic data of male and female subjects. We achieved an accuracy and F1 score of 94.56% and 94.56% respectively for SVM Linear classifier. Our event detection technique locates a seismic event and extracts only the corresponding footsteps from the signal. It reduces the feature extraction time by 50%.

A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry, and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes 'in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand'. This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], 'more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products, the majority of these people live in developing countries' [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] 'the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks'. In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

In network security, various traditional techniques like intrusion prevention, cryptography and user authentication are unable to detect establishment of novel attacks. An intrusion detection systemis helpful in detecting an unusual intruder which cracks into the system or genuine user mistreating the system. Intrusion Detection System continually runs in the background and when any suspicious or obtrusive event occurs then it warns the user. To implement these systems various researchers introduced numerous machine learning techniques like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Linear Genetic Programming, Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Inference Systems, Rule Based Approach and their ensemble approaches with the intent to predict the data either normal or abnormal. In this paper genetic programming with K-Nearest Neighbor classifier is proposed so as to build an efficient Intrusion Detection Model.

Messages are exchanged by mobile phone users to facilitate the speedy exchange of information. However, some messages are not solicited in every situation. Delivery of irrelevant/spam messages in a particular scenario often leads to the frustration of users. Also, it is of utmost importance that the relevant and significant messages get delivered to the users at appropriate instances. This can be made possible by developing a mechanism which scrutinizes the incoming text messages and delivers them based on their relevance and priority. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach which would enable the categorization of text messages based on their content and deliver them according to appropriate priorities. © 2016 IEEE.",Categorization; Information Retrieval; Machine Learning; Message Filtering; Prioritization; Text Mining,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Education; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Categorization; Communication media; Exchange of information; Machine learning approaches; Mobile-phone users; Prioritization; Priority-based; Text mining; Information filtering,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Bombay Sect.

In this paper, facial expression recognition using Efficient Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for feature extraction and artificial neural network (ANN) for classification is presented. Facial feature vectors are obtained using Efficient LBP algorithm by considering the blocks of four varied sizes (256 x 256, 128 x 128, 64 x 64 and 32 x 32) of the image dataset. The multiclass classification of the image dataset into the six basic universal emotions is carried out using ANN. We have implemented General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) for classification in this experiment. GRNN trains the network faster and does not require iterative training procedure. The free parameter of the network, spread constant is optimized to reduce the mean square error and thus the efficiency of recognition is improved as seen from the experimental results. The proposed algorithm is tested using widely used standard database such as Japanese Female Facial Expression Database, Taiwanese Facial Expression Database, Cohn-Kanade Expression Database and Indian face database of students.

There is stiff competition among various companies and every company wants to have its clients happy and satisfied with the resolution of the problems. For this purpose, Agent Quality Monitoring is an important requirement. Since in a typical Call Centre, thousands of calls are made by agents in a single day, it is not possible to manually identify problematic calls by monitoring each and every agentclient conversation. Moreover, sometimes, individual monitoring is biased. What is non problematic for one can be problematic for another individual. Moreover, it is almost impossible to manually identify problematic calls in a language one doesn't know. Without a suitable technical approach, it is difficult to identify problematic calls without translating the call contents into our language, which often leads to security and privacy concerns for a private company. In this paper a sample of calls was taken and a proper technical approach is used to analyze the calls. The design of the proposed system is language independent. In this project, we make use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on 4 robust audio features, namely Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Energy, Volume and Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR). The support vectors are obtained by training the sample data set. The SVM Classifier is based on a simple algorithm which solves the two class problem and classifies the calls as problematic or non-problematic.

Still conventional IDS finds itself limited when it comes to distribute intrusion detection. An intruder may conceal its origin of attack by moving from node to node in a network. In order to conquer these limitations, alerts are to be exchanged and correlated in distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) in a cooperative manner. Because of diversity of network behavior and high growth in development of new types of attacks, intrusion detection algorithm based on fast machine learning methods are of great significance to reduce the false alarm rates with high accuracy of detection rate. This work proposes using a DIDS model for data collection across the network and a hybrid method that classifies the network activities collected in the DIDS model as normal and abnormal. This hybrid method is a combination of popular machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) which is to be used on a model for DIDS. Also it can detect unseen attacks of intrusion with high detection rate with minimal misclassification. Experiments show that usage of hybrid method on the DIDS model is superior to that of SVM alone or ACO alone both in terms of run-Time efficiency and detection rate. © 2016 IEEE.",Ant colony optimization (ACO); Data classification; Intrusion detection system (IDS); Machine learning; Support vector machine (SVM),Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Network security; Optimization; Support vector machines; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Data classification; Distributed intrusion detection systems; High detection rate; Intrusion detection algorithms; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning methods; Run-time efficiency; Intrusion detection,,Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The proposed feature is evaluated using mutual information (MI) on the difference and ratio values of the Fourier parameters, amplitude and frequency. The difference and ratio are calculated between two contiguous values of the Fourier parameters. To analyze the out-of-breath speech, a new stressed speech database, named out-of-breath speech (OBS) database, is created. The database contains three classes of speech, out-of-breath speech, low out-of-breath speech and normal speech. The effectiveness of the proposed features is evaluated with the statistical analysis. The proposed features not only differentiate the normal speech and the out-of-breath speech, but also can discriminate different breath emission levels of speech. Hidden Markov model (HMM) and support vector machine (SVM) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed features using the OBS database. For multi-class classification problem, SVM classifier is used with binary cascade approach. The performance of the proposed features is compared with the breathiness feature, the mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature and the Teager energy operator (TEO) based critical band TEO autocorrelation envelope (TEO-CB-Auto-Env) feature.

Using an autoencoder as baseline, this paper presents a novel formulation for a class sparsity based supervised encoder, termed as CSSE. We postulate that features from the same class will have a common sparsity pattern/support in the latent space. Therefore, in the formulation of the autoencoder, a supervision penalty is introduced as a joint-sparsity promoting l2,1-norm. The formulation of CSSE is derived for a single hidden layer and it is applied for multiple hidden layers using a greedy layer-by-layer learning approach. The proposed CSSE approach is applied for learning face representation and verification experiments are performed on the LFW and PaSC face databases. The experiments show that the proposed approach yields improved results compared to autoencoders and comparable results with state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",autoencoders; deep learning; Face verification; supervised feature learning,Deep learning; Learning systems; Signal encoding; Autoencoders; Face recognition algorithms; Face representations; Face Verification; Feature learning; Feature representation; Learning architectures; Reconstruction error; Face recognition,,,IEEE Computer Society,1628828,,ITPID,,English,IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019251020

Generalization capability of the model is enhanced with a fast and improved learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM). The model explores the features of an input pattern to the possible extent in order to acquire improved class discriminatory information for data sets with ill-defined and overlapping class boundaries. This is obtained through feature-wise degree of belonging of patterns to different classes. Two ways of feature exploration; one using fuzzy set theory to deal with the impreciseness, and other using neighborhood rough set (NRS) theory to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness in the data sets, makes the classification model more efficient. A fuzzification matrix is finally developed with these features, whose elements are fed as input to the neural network. The resultant model thus takes the advantages of fuzzy sets, NRS and ELM algorithm mutually, which is highly suitable for the classification of data sets with overlapping class boundaries. Superiority of the proposed model to other similar methods is established qualitatively and quantitatively using both completely labeled data sets and partially labeled remote sensing images. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Extreme learning machine; Fuzzy sets; Hybridization; Neighborhood rough sets; Neural networks; Pattern recognition,Algorithms; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Image reconstruction; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Remote sensing; Rough set theory; Set theory; Classification models; Classification of data; Extreme learning machine; Generalization capability; Hybridization; Neighborhood rough sets; Neuro-fuzzy network; Remote sensing images; Classification (of information),"Meher, S.K.; Systems Science and Informatics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 8th Mile, Mysore Road, India; email: saroj.meher@isibang.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953388682

Cloud computing has numerous applications in fields of education, social networking, and medicine. But the benefit of cloud for medical purposes is seamless, particularly because of the enormous data generated by the health care industry. This colossal data can be managed through big data analytics, and hidden patterns can be extracted using machine learning procedures. In particular, the latest issue in the medical domain is the prediction of heart diseases, which can be resolved through culmination of machine learning and cloud computing. Hence, an attempt has been made to propose an intelligent decision support model that can aid medical experts in predicting heart disease based on the historical data of patients. Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented on the heart disease dataset to predict accuracy for heart disease. Naïve Bayes has been selected as an effective model because it provides the highest accuracy of 86.42% followed by AdaBoost and boosted tree. Further, these 3 models are being ensembled, which has increased the overall accuracy to 87.91%.

In this paper, a simple and linearly convergent Lagrangian support vector machine algorithm for the dual of the ?-TSVR is proposed. The contributions of our formulation are as follows: (1) we consider the square of the 2-norm of the vector of slack variables instead of the usual 1-norm to make the objective functions strongly convex. (2) We are solving regression problem with just two systems of linear equations as opposed to solving two QPPs in ?-TSVR and TSVR or one large QPP in SVR, which leads to extremely simple and fast algorithm.

However, only empirical risk is considered in the primal problems of TSVR and LTSVR due to its complex structure and thus may incur overfitting and suboptimal in some cases.

Granger causality is employed to assign preferences to each criteria. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to obtain weights for different features from the two criteria and their preferences.

The internet provides many opportunities for companies to provide personalized online services to their customers, but the quality and novelty of some web services may adversely affect the appeal and user gratification. In the future, prediction of the consumer intention needs to be a main focus for selecting the web services for an application. The aim of this study is to predict online consumer repurchase intentions; to accomplish this objective a hybrid approach is chosen with a combination of machine learning techniques and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm being used. The study starts with identification of consumer characteristics for repurchase intention, followed by determining the feature selection of consumer characteristics and shopping mall attributes (with >0.1 threshold value) for the prediction model using ABC. Finally, validation using k-fold cross has been employed to measure the best classification model robustness. The classification models, viz. decision trees (C5.0), AdaBoost, random forest, support vector machine and neural network, are utilized to predict consumer purchase intention. Performance evaluation of identified models on training–testing partitions (70–30%) of the data set shows that the AdaBoost method outperforms other classification models, with sensitivity and accuracy of 0.95 and 97.58%, respectively, on testing the data set.

This also tends to further limit the interaction that the speech-impaired people can have with the society at large. To address this issue, a machine learning based wearable and low-cost system to identify dynamic Indian sign language gestures, is presented. The system uses machine learning to identify the sign made by the wearer and then the audio clip corresponding to that gesture is played out aloud so that the listener is able to identify the meaning of that gesture. A prototype system that can identify and interpret a total of fifty-six dynamic Indian sign language gestures has been designed and tested. Effectiveness of three different machine learning approaches based on Naive Bayes, Decision trees and Support Vector Machines respectively, has also been evaluated. Results indicate that the proposed system is capable of successfully identifying gestures with an accuracy greater than 93%. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Learning systems; Robotics; Wearable technology; Impaired people; Indian sign languages; Interpretation systems; Low-cost systems; Machine learning approaches; Naive bayes; Prototype system; Sign language; Education,"Nair, B.B.; Dept of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita UniversityIndia; email: b_binoy@cb.amrita.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Density difference between features for paired classes is used for assigning weights to the features. Existing methods select only those features that can distinguish between all classes at the same time. A new filter based feature selection method termed as Paired Class Density Difference with Inconsistency (PCDDI) is proposed in this paper. It can be used for a multi-class problem. This approach selects those features that distinguish between few classes but still play an important role in classification. Inconsistency measure is used in order to remove redundancy in the selected feature set. Classification accuracy of the proposed method is compared with that obtained using existing filter based feature selection methods on UCI machine learning repository datasets and on manual segmentation data provided by NIST. Increased classification accuracy for PCDDI shows that the concept of using density difference to assign feature weight is a significant contribution. © 2016 IEEE.,density function; Feature Selection; Filter approach; Inconsistency measure.,Feature extraction; Learning systems; Probability density function; Classification accuracy; Feature selection algorithm; Feature selection methods; Filter approach; Inconsistency measures; Multi-class problems; Robust feature selection; UCI machine learning repository; Classification (of information),"Chandra, B.; Sprinklr and Adjunct IITIndia; email: bchandra104@yahoo.co.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The optimal number of hidden neurons in ELM is evaluated by varying the number of hidden neurons in some range. Most of the recently published articles, quote the number of hidden neurons at which the ELM gives the maximum testing accuracy. Ideally, the model should not be selected using the testing accuracy because testing dataset is unseen. Selecting the number of hidden neurons by observing the training accuracy might be misleading as solution with higher training accuracy might suffers from overfitting. In this work, we have developed a variant of ELM which does not required manual tuning of the number of hidden neurons. The proposed ELM variant also has a minimum network structure, with slightly less testing performance compared to original ELM. In original ELM highest testing performance is quoted without any description to select the optimal number of hidden neurons. The proposed ELM variant initially set the number of hidden neurons to higher value and then removes the highly correlated hidden neurons to minimize the network structure. The proposed work also removes the overfitting problem in original ELM.

Initially, experiments using synthetic random data (generated from different probability distributions) are performed to prove the efficiency of the proposed method for multimodal and non-Gaussian data with the help of five separability measures. Also, extensive experimental results on UCI machine learning repository and image retrieval on WANG and MIT (Oliva and Torralba) databases are carried out in order to exhibit the effectiveness of moments discriminant analysis over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Dimensionality reduction; Image retrieval; Kernel; Projection space; Statistical moments; Subspace learning,Discriminant analysis; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image retrieval; Learning systems; Dimensionality reduction; Kernel; Projection space; Statistical moments; Subspace learning; Probability distributions; Article; classification algorithm; data base; discriminant analysis; image processing; intermethod comparison; linear system; machine learning; moments discriminant analysis; probability; statistical model; supervised dimensionality reduction,"Murthy, K.R.; Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: k.ramachandra@isical.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,9252312,,NRCGE,,English,Neurocomputing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014409957

The statistical classifiers used in these data fusion approaches are also transformed by integrating the contextual information from neighboring pixels, to improve the accuracy of a fuzzy-logic-based fusion scheme. A decision level fusion approach was developed by Gokaraju et. al, 2012, which combines statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Here, each data sample is integrated through separate classifiers such as empirical methods and support vector machines (SVMs) and then used a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to fuse the decisions for a unified consensus decision. The data fusion approach consists of either pixel-level or feature-level data fusion in combination with machine learning techniques for classification. The intermediate results of the disaster management studies, such as levee land-slide and tornado debris assessment using data fusion techniques, are presented in this paper. For levee landslide studies, we used the multi-temporal datasets of air-borne synthetic aperture radar sensor (UAVSAR). For Tornado disaster studies, we used multi-source and multi-temporal datasets of both synthetic aperture radar sensor (RADARSAT-2) and multispectral sensor (RapiEye) datasets.

The first one uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the second one autoencoders. RBMs are stacked in layers to form deep belief network (DBN), the final representation layer is attached to the target to complete the deep neural network. Autoencoders are nested one inside the other to form stacked autoencoders, once the stcaked autoencoder is learnt the decoder portion is detached and the target attached to the deepest layer of the encoder to form the deep neural network. This work proposes a new approach to train deep neural networks using dictionary learning as the basic building block, the idea is to use the features from the shallower layer as inputs for training the next deeper layer. One can use any type of dictionary learning (unsupervised, supervised, discriminative etc.) as basic units till the pre-final layer. In the final layer one needs to use the label consistent dictionary learning formulation for classification.

In this paper, an automated text classification system is proposed in order to classify the data effectively. The classification of the tweets related to disaster is a challenging task as the texts are not correctly written or do not convey the exact meaning since people send the text messages in panic situations. A manual vocabulary has been created by considering the nature of the disaster data. The created vocabulary is used for splitting the tweets into various categories. In the categorized data, popular statistical feature selection methods like, term frequency, Chi Square are used in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes algorithms to classify the data.

Due to technology and processes changes, some of these spares become obsolete or dead inventory. Factories have huge dead inventory worth millions of dollars accumulating over time. This is due to lack of a scientific methodology to identify them and send the inventory back to the suppliers on a timely basis. The standard approach followed across industries to deal with this is to declare a part as dead if a part is not used for a set pre-defined period of time. This leads to accumulation of the dead parts over time and these parts cannot be sold back to the suppliers as it is too late as per contract agreement. Our main idea is that the time period for identifying a part as dead cannot be a fixed pre-defined duration across all parts. This time period should depend on various properties of the part like the historical consumption pattern of the part, type of part, how many machines this part is associated with, if this part is a preventive maintenance part etc. We have designed a predictive algorithm which predicts part obsolescence well in advance with reasonable accuracy thus helping save millions of dollars. © 2016 IEEE.",Big data; Machine learning; Obsolete inventory; Supply chain analytics,Green computing; Internet of things; Learning systems; Obsolescence; Preventive maintenance; Supply chain management; Consumption patterns; Contract agreements; Obsolete inventory; Predictive algorithms; Predictive modelling; Reasonable accuracy; Scientific methodology; Spare parts inventories; Big data,,Liu X.Qiu T.Li Y.Guo B.Ning Z.Lu K.Dong M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Here, we develop a framework for automatic extraction of human understandable fuzzy rules for software fault detection/classification. This is an integrated framework to simultaneously identify useful determinants (attributes) of faults and fuzzy rules using those attributes. At the beginning of the training, the system assumes every attribute (feature) as a useless feature and then uses a concept of feature attenuating gate to select useful features. The learning process opens the gates or closes them more tightly based on utility of the features. Our system can discard derogatory and indifferent attributes and select the useful ones. It can also exploit subtle nonlinear interaction between attributes. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we have used several publicly available software fault data sets and compared the performance of our method with that of some existing methods. The results using tenfold cross-validation setup show that our system can find useful fuzzy rules for fault prediction. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature modulating gates; fuzzy rule generation; machine learning; software fault prediction; software metric selection,Computer software; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Fuzzy rules; Learning systems; Software testing; Automatic extraction; Feature modulating gates; Integrated frameworks; Nonlinear interactions; Rule generation; Software fault detection; Software fault prediction; Software metrices; Fuzzy inference,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21682216,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

By doing this, it would be possible to find the time required to travel on all possible routes for any given origin-destination pair. The study also emphasizes the need for splitting links into intersection and midlinks. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used for prediction at the midlinks and a random forest predictor was developed to predict the travel time on the high-variation intersection links. For intersections with location-based sensors, a methodology for delay and travel-time prediction was proposed on the basis of predicted values of queue length. Overall, it was observed that better prediction accuracy was achieved when links were considered separately as midlink and intersection.

But, the number of labeled samples present in these bands that would be used for training is scarce and also the acquisition of the labeled samples is difficult and time consuming. Whereas, the generation of the unlabeled samples is effortless. The Semisupervised Learning (SLL) algorithm helps to obtain the unlabeled samples from a constrained set of labeled samples without much struggle and cost. In proposed method, the semisupervised learning that adapts the Self learning strategies is developed. In the self learning method the machine learning algorithm itself selects the most favorable unlabeled samples for the classification process. Two different approaches are used.

Any downtime due to these devices, even for a few minutes, may result in major business impact. There are many proactive event management systems/products which can monitor their health and alert on device failure. However, predicting failure with sufficient lead time still remains a challenging problem. Event management systems take system log messages and simple network management protocol (SNMP) traps as inputs and typically use rule based framework to generate network events. In this paper we discuss how we can use event data alone to build predictive model for device failures. Here all event data is generated by an event management tool. Event data volume is substantially less compared to full system log data. Also, these network devices fail rarely. Lower volume of event data enables us collect historical data for longer durations and thus collect decent number of failure samples over time which we can use for training and validation. We present a prediction model for failure events based on event sequence data. We have introduced new stratified sampling techniques along with a new feature engineering method using sliding time windows on event data. Experiments show that for rare device failure events like the load balancers it suffices to use event data to model device failures instead of using raw system log data. We have evaluated binary classification algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). Experimental results show that with the proper noise cleanup technique and model tuning we can achieve precision of 77% and recall of 67% for the failure predictions of network devices only from event data. © 2016 IEEE.",Big Data; Failure Prediction; Machine Learning; Network; SVM,Computer system firewalls; Data acquisition; Electric fault currents; Forecasting; Green computing; Internet of things; Learning systems; Networks (circuits); Support vector machines; Binary classification; Event sequence datum; Failure prediction; Feature engineerings; Logistic regressions; Network infrastructure; Simple network management protocols; Sliding time windows; Big data,,Liu X.Qiu T.Li Y.Guo B.Ning Z.Lu K.Dong M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Boundary region analysis of rough set theory and multivariate mutual information of information theory are used as two objective functions in the proposed work, to select only precise and informative data from the data set. Data set is sampled with replacement strategy and the method is applied to determine non-dominated feature subsets from each sampled data set. Finally, ensemble of such bi-objective genetic algorithm based feature selectors is developed with the help of parallel implementations to produce much generalized feature subset. In fact, individual feature selector outputs are aggregated using a novel dominance based principle to produce final feature subset. Proposed work is validated using repository especially for feature selection datasets as well as on UCI machine learning repository datasets and the experimental results are compared with related state of art feature selection methods to show effectiveness of the proposed ensemble feature selection method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Evolutionary optimization; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Mutual information; Rough set theory; Supervised learning,Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Information theory; Learning systems; Optimization; Rough set theory; Set theory; Supervised learning; Ensemble feature selections; Evolutionary optimizations; Feature selection methods; Feature selection problem; Multivariate mutual information; Mutual informations; Parallel implementations; UCI machine learning repository; Feature extraction,"Das, A.K.; Department of Computer Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: akdas@cs.iiests.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,9507051,,KNSYE,,English,Knowl Based Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013360376

Birla Goa Campus, Goa, 403726, India","Intrusion detection has been playing a crucial role for making a computer network secure for any transaction. An intrusion detection system (IDS) detects various types of malicious network traffic and computer usage, which sometimes may not be detected by a conventional firewall. Recently, many IDS have been developed based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, advanced detection approaches created by combining or integrating evolutionary algorithms and neural networks have shown better detection performance than general machine learning approaches. The present study reports two new hybrid intrusion detection methods; one is based on gravitational search (GS), and other one is a combination of GS and particle swarm optimization (GSPSO). These two techniques have been successfully implemented to train artificial neural network (ANN) and the resulting models: GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN are successfully applied for intrusion detection process. The applicability of these proposed approaches is also compared with other conventional methods such as decision tree, ANN based on gradient descent (GD-ANN), ANN based on genetic algorithm (GA-ANN) and ANN based on PSO (PSO-ANN) by testing with NSL-KDD dataset. Moreover, the results obtained by GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN are found to be statistically significant based on the popular Wilcoxon’s rank sum test as compared to other conventional techniques. The obtained test results reported that the proposed GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN could achieve a maximum detection accuracy of 94.9 and 98.13 % respectively. The proposed models (GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN) could also achieve good performance when tested with highly imbalanced datasets. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial neural network; Intrusion detection; Intrusion detection system; NSL-KDD,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer networks; Computer system firewalls; Data mining; Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Neural networks; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistical tests; Trees (mathematics); Conventional methods; Conventional techniques; Detection performance; Hybrid intrusion detection; Imbalanced Data-sets; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning approaches; NSL-KDD; Intrusion detection,"Dash, T.; Data Science Laboratory, School of Computer Science, National Institute of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: tirtharaj@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949491626

An important precursor to this goal is the identification and correction of potentially ambiguous requirements statements. Pronominal Anaphora ambiguity is one such type of pragmatic or referential ambiguity in NL requirements, which needs attention. However, identification of such ambiguous requirements statements is a challenging task since the count of such statements is relatively lower. We present a solution to this challenge by considering the task as that of a classification problem to classify ambiguous requirements statements having pronominal anaphora ambiguity from a corpus of potentially ambiguous requirements statements with pronominal anaphora ambiguity. We show how a classifier can be trained in semi-supervised manner to detect such instances of pronominal anaphoric ambiguous requirements statements.

However, minimizing a simple loss function cannot guarantee an optimal performance. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the complex performance measure directly to obtain a predictive model. We proposed to construct a maximum likelihood model for this problem, and to learn the model parameter, we minimize a complex loss function corresponding to the desired complex performance measure. To optimize the loss function, we approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. We also propose to impose the sparsity to the model parameter to obtain a sparse model. An objective was constructed by combining the upper bound of the loss function and the sparsity of the model parameter, and we develop an iterative algorithm to minimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm framework. The experiments on optimization on three different complex performance measures, including F-score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and recall precision curve break-even point, over three real-world applications, aircraft event recognition of civil aviation safety, intrusion detection in wireless mesh networks, and image classification, show the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Civil aviation safety; Complex multivariate performance; Machine learning; Maximum likelihood; Sparse learning,Aircraft detection; Artificial intelligence; Civil aviation; Curve fitting; Intrusion detection; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; MESH networking; Optimization; Safety engineering; Civil aviation safeties; Complex multivariate performance; Iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms; Machine learning methods; Prediction performance; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Sparse learning; State-of-the-art methods; Complex networks,"Zhang, N.; Guangzhou Civil Aviation CollegeChina; email: zhangning115@yahoo.com",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

Continuous authentication has been explored as an approach for alleviating such concerns. Previous methods for continuous authentication primarily use biometrics, e.g., fingerprint and face recognition, or behaviometrics, e.g., key stroke patterns. We describe CABA, a novel continuous authentication system that is inspired by and leverages the emergence of sensors for pervasive and continuous health monitoring. CABA authenticates users based on their BioAura, an ensemble of biomedical signal streams that can be collected continuously and non-invasively using wearable medical devices. While each such signal may not be highly discriminative by itself, we demonstrate that a collection of such signals, along with robust machine learning, can provide high accuracy levels. We demonstrate the feasibility of CABA through analysis of traces from the MIMIC-II dataset. We propose various applications of CABA, and describe how it can be extended to user identification and adaptive access control authorization. Finally, we discuss possible attacks on the proposed scheme and suggest corresponding countermeasures. © 2016 IEEE.",Authentication; behaviometrics; biomedical signals; biometrics; biostreams; continuous authentication; machine learning; security; wearable medical devices,Access control; Artificial intelligence; Bioelectric phenomena; Biomedical equipment; Biometrics; Face recognition; Learning systems; Network security; Pattern recognition; Wearable technology; Behaviometrics; Biomedical signal; biostreams; Continuous authentications; security; Wearable medical devices; Authentication,,,IEEE Computer Society,189340,,ITCOB,,English,IEEE Trans Comput,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018499378

Although some form of security mechanisms like authentication and encryption have been provided on platforms such as Android, these alone cannot mitigate all the forms of threats. Thus, the need for an intrusion detection system for smartphones has become immensely important. In this project, we capitalize on earlier approaches of host-based intrusion detection systems and behavior-based intrusion detection systems for Android smartphones to design and implement a host-based, behavior-based passive intrusion detection system, Protego, for Android smartphones. There are two versions-static and dynamic, each with its own novel approach. The static version of Protego improves predictive performance by implementing feature reduction, thus increasing classifier accuracy significantly. The novelty of dynamic approach is that it analyzes live traffic with a minimum delay (in the order of milliseconds). This opens up a variety of use cases for our system, especially in the business world where information security on smartphones is of utmost importance. We have illustrated this by also extending Protego to devise a solution for BYOD (bring your own device), a growing trend in the corporate world, by using the IDS to detect other malicious activities like peer-to-peer traffic from torrent clients. © 2016 IEEE.",Android; Information Security; Intrusion Detection System; Machine Learning; Protego,Android (operating system); Authentication; Computer crime; Cryptography; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Mobile security; Security of data; Smartphones; Android; Bring your own devices; Design and implements; Host-based intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious activities; Predictive performance; Protego; Intrusion detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The proposed method determines the face as well as the facial landmark points, extracts discriminating features from suitable facial regions, and classifies the expressions in real-time from live webcam feed. The speed of the system is improved by the appropriate combination of the detection and tracking algorithms. Further, instead of the whole face, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features are extracted from the active facial patches which makes the system robust against the scale and pose variations. The feature vectors are further fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify into neutral or six universal expressions.

Due to rapid increase in the amount of user-generated data on social media platforms like Twitter, several opportunities and new open doors have been prompted for organizations that endeavour hard to keep a track on customer reviews and opinions about their products. Twitter is a huge fast emergent micro-blogging social networking platform for users to express their views about politics, products sports etc. These views are useful for businesses, government and individuals. Hence, tweets can be used as a valuable source for mining public's opinion. Sentiment analysis is a process of automatically identifying whether a user-generated text expresses positive, negative or neutral opinion about an entity (i.e. product, people, topic, event etc). The objective of this paper is to give step-by-step detail about the process of sentiment analysis on twitter data using machine learning. This paper also provides details of proposed approach for sentiment analysis.

While considering the lumbar Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), identification of pathologies is a complex task as the size of the soft tissues may vary. Before recognizing the injury in the soft tissue, it is necessary to identify in which soft tissue, the pathology occurs. In order to address this issue, the classification of lumbar Intervertebral Discs (IVDs) on lumbar MRI is performed. The classification is determined after feature extraction on the region of interest. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is applied to extract the features and a model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. A multi-class classification is performed on 80 subjects, both T1-weighted and T2-weighted, with a total of 960 Intervertebral Discs. The result of the research work done in this paper gives 71.53% accuracy on the classification of Lumbar MR Images.

Numerous researches have been proposed to ward off the inherent security risks, though these solutions are not enough to identify and remove all the vulnerabilities. In this paper, a self-adaptive IV-Phase MAP Security Architecture is proposed, which is inspired by the Biological Immune System, with the prime objective of detecting unknown malicious mobile agents. In this context, data mining methods are studied for the detection of unknown malicious executable. In particular, Boyer Moore pattern matching algorithm and N-gram feature analysis of mobile agent using a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, facilitate the discovery of known and unknown malicious content from incoming mobile agent in the proposed architecture, and protects against the Man In The Middle (MITM) attack, the Masquerading Attack, the Replay attack, the Repudiation attack and the Unauthorized Access Attack. The architecture is designed and implemented in IBM Aglets. A comprehensive 5-fold cross validation scheme on a large collection of malicious and non-malicious files is performed while performing Classification technique involving Feature Selection Method. The propitious experimental outcomes express that the performance (time and security) and accuracy of proposed architecture outperform the earlier known related schemes and makes the proposed architecture suitable for MAP protection in the Mobile Agent Environment (MAE). Above all, these findings exhibit wide-ranging newness, since the concept of machine learning has never been employed so far in the sphere of Mobile Agents System (MAS).

In this paper, we propose an axiomatic framework for clustering which considers both the quality and the computational complexity of clustering algorithms. The axioms proposed by us necessarily associate the problem of clustering with the important concept of incremental learning and divide and conquer learning. We also propose an order independent incremental clustering algorithm which satisfies all of these axioms in some constrained manner. © 2016 IEEE.",,Big data; Computational complexity; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Axiomatic framework; Computational aspects; Divide and conquer learning; Incremental clustering; Incremental clustering algorithm; Incremental learning; Order independents; Particular algorithms; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10514651,9.78151E+12,PICRE,,English,Proc.

Three different disease parameters namely, erythema, scaling and induration are considered for such severity grading. Given an image containing a psoriatic plaque the task is to predict severity scores for all the three parameters. This paper presents a novel deep CNN based architecture for achieving the task. Apart from viewing this task as three different single task learning (STL) problems (i.e. three different classification problems), a new multi-task learning (MTL) is also presented where the three classification tasks are treated as interdependent and thereby the neural net is trained accordingly. A new annotated dataset consisting of seven hundred and seven (707) images has been constructed on which the performance of the severity scoring algorithms have been reported. Several competing baselines are considered to compare the performance of STL and MTL approaches. Experimental result shows that the deep CNN based architectures (both the STL and MTL) achieve promising performances, MTL producing slightly superior results to that of STL. © 2016 IEEE.",,Dermatology; Grading; Learning systems; Linearization; Skin; Automatic machines; Classification tasks; CNN-based architecture; Multitask learning; Psoriatic plaques; Scoring algorithms; Single task learning; Three parameters; Pattern recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10514651,9.78151E+12,PICRE,,English,Proc.

We observed that, a good number of authors hypothesized that the performance of fault prediction model depends on the source code metrics which are used as input of the model. Feature selection technique is a process of selecting suitable set of source code metrics which may improve the performance of fault prediction model. In this work, genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied as feature selection technique to select the suitable set of source code metrics. This selected set of source code metrics are used as requisite input data to develop a classifier using five different classification techniques such as logistic regression, extreme learning machine, support vector machine (SVM) with three different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and radial basis kernel functions) in order to predict the faulty and non-faulty classes. In this study, we propose a cost evaluation framework to perform cost based analysis for evaluating the effectiveness of fault prediction model. We perform experiments on thirty number of Java Open Source projects. From the obtained results, it is observed that the model developed using selected set of source code metrics obtained better result as compared to all metrics.

However, the existing SONs will be no match for the operational complexity of the envisioned 5G networks. The promise of 5G revolves around the premise of infinite capacity and zero latency. 5G networks are set for commercial availability by 2020 and these networks will be part of a flexible and dynamic telecom ecosystem supporting cross-domain integration and multi-RAT environments. Network Densification, Network Function Virtualization, Flexible spectrum allocation, E2E security and Massive MTC are a few of the features promised by 5G networks. With this assortment of numerous technologies, it is obvious that SONs have to evolve beyond the existing reactive paradigm without which the maintenance and management of 5G networks would prove to be a herculean task.

The probability of its occurrence is usually dominated by the photovoltaic penetration however, as a direct consequence of this, load-inverter dynamic interactions alongside grid-side disturbances can also lead to anomalous instances that can become responsible for accidental island creation and one such anomaly has been described in this work. Given such dynamic behaviours occurring on photovoltaic inverter-integrated distribution feeders, threshold based classical islanding detection can not suffice and hence machine learning based techniques have began to be researched and adopted. However the orientation can be directed towards predictive approaches leveraging knowledge extraction from huge event data available in smart grids. Furthermore, unsupervised learning can be explored for real-time applications to enable self-learning and acting systems. This paper presents preliminary results of application of a self-organizing map neural network for preemptive detection of unintentional islanding by classifying the discovered islanding precursor from other power system events.

To offer such learner centric methodology, one need to have an architecture that proposes, designs, develops and experiments that behave like an intelligent learning agent.

This profiling helps the tutor also in identifying the overall behavior of each learner in the system, proposes the learner behavior indicating the overall progress and overall competency scale of the learners in same cluster and based on the this system generates the evaluation pattern for the cluster for learners.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) records the neurological activity in the brain and it is used to identify epilepsy. Visual inspection of EEG signals is a time-consuming process and it may lead to human error. Feature extraction and classification are two main steps that are required to build an automated epilepsy detection framework. Feature extraction reduces the dimensions of the input signal by retaining informative features and the classifier assigns a proper class label to the extracted feature vector. Our aim is to present effective feature extraction techniques for automated epileptic EEG signal classification. Methods In this study, two effective feature extraction techniques (Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern [LNDP] and One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern [1D-LGP]) have been introduced to classify epileptic EEG signals. The classification between epileptic seizure and non-seizure signals is performed using different machine learning classifiers. The benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset provided by the University of Bonn is used in this research. The classification performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The classifiers used are the Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiments have been repeated for 50 times. Results LNDP and 1D-LGP feature extraction techniques with ANN classifier achieved the average classification accuracy of 99.82% and 99.80%, respectively, for the classification between normal and epileptic EEG signals. Eight different experimental cases were tested. The classification results were better than those of some existing methods. Conclusions This study suggests that LNDP and 1D-LGP could be effective feature extraction techniques for the classification of epileptic EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; Feature extraction; Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern (LNDP); One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern (1D-LGP),Brain; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image retrieval; Learning systems; Neural networks; Neurology; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram signals; Feature extraction and classification; Feature extraction techniques; Local gradient patterns; Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern (LNDP); World Health Organization; Biomedical signal processing; Article; artificial neural network; decision tree; disease classification; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; extraction; machine learning; priority journal; research; seizure; support vector machine,"Jaiswal, A.K.India; email: abegiitdhanbad@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

But due to the large volume of genes and the complexity of biological networks it is difficult to study the resulting mass of data which often consists of millions of measurements. In order to reveal natural structures and to identify interesting patterns from the given gene expression data set, clustering techniques are applied. Semi-supervised classification is a new direction of machine learning. It requires huge unlabeled data and a few labeled data. Semi-supervised classification in general performs better than unsupervised classification. But to the best of our knowledge there are no works for solving gene expression data clustering problem using semi-supervised classification techniques. In the current paper we have made an attempt to solve the gene expression data clustering problem using a multiobjective optimization based semi-supervised classification technique with the aim to attain good quality partitions by using few labeled data. In order to generate the labeled data, initially Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is applied. In order to automatically determine the partitioning, multiple cluster centers corresponding to a cluster are encoded in the form of a string. In order to compute the quality of the obtained partitioning, values of five objective functions are computed. The effectiveness of this proposed semi-supervised clustering technique is demonstrated on five publicly available benchmark gene expression data sets. Comparison results with the existing techniques for gene expression data clustering prove that the proposed method is the most effective one.

In this study, we demonstrate the applications of supervised machine learning methods to reduce the irrelevance in microarray data series and thereby extract robust molecular markers to track biological processes. The methodology has been illustrated by analyzing whole genome expression studies on bone-implant integration (ossointegration). Being a biological process, osseointegration is known to leave a trail of genetic footprint during the course. In spite of existence of enormous amount of raw data in public repositories, researchers still do not have access to a panel of genes that can definitively track osseointegration. The results from our study revealed panels comprising of matrix metalloproteinases and collagen genes were able to track osseointegration on implant surfaces (MMP9 and COL1A2 on micro-textured; MMP12 and COL6A3 on superimposed nano-textured surfaces) with 100% classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, our analysis showed the importance of the progression of the duration in establishment of the mechanical connection at bone-implant surface. The findings from this study are expected to be useful to researchers investigating osseointegration of novel implant materials especially at the early stage. The methodology demonstrated can be easily adapted by scientists in different fields to analyze large databases for other biological processes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Gene ontology; Microarray data; Osseointegration; Statistical classifiers; Surface texture,Bone; Classification (of information); Gene expression; Genes; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Gene ontology; Microarray data; Osseointegration; Statistical classifier; Surface textures; Metal implants; COL1A2 protein; COL6A3 protein; collagen; gelatinase B; macrophage elastase; unclassified drug; biological marker; titanium; Article; biomechanics; bone implant; bone regeneration; classification; classifier; gene expression; human; microarray analysis; molecular genetics; sensitivity and specificity; supervised machine learning; surface property; bone; genetic marker; machine learning; osseointegration; prostheses and orthoses; Biomarkers; Bone and Bones; Genetic Markers; Machine Learning; Osseointegration; Prostheses and Implants; Titanium,"Chakravorty, N.email: nishant@smst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Academic Press Inc.,15320464,,JBIOB,28288857,English,J.

For visual object tracking, the MIL framework is used to select a few discriminative features from a pool of features by maximizing the bag likelihood. The feature pool consists of computationally efficient Haar-like features. Each feature is used for the construction of weak classifier also called decision stump. A few classifiers with high discriminative power (to separate target from background) are combined to form a strong classifier. The key point is the selection of a few highly discriminative features from a very large pool in small amount of time to ensure fast and accurate tracking. In this paper, we propose a fast online feature selection algorithm based on maximizing the classifier score (CSR). The tracking performance is better than the existing feature selection methods. This paper also introduces kernel trick on Haar-like features for target tracking. Furthermore, we explore use of Haar-features in half target space. To get the actual target size in successive video frames, a scaling strategy is applied. By having the feature matching using kernel, Haar-features in half target spaces and scale adaptation method in a single tracking framework, we obtain better tracking performance as compared to the state-of-the-art trackers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Classifier score; Computer vision; Haar-features; Kernels; Multiple instance learning; Visual tracking; Weak classifier,Computer vision; Image processing; Lakes; Learning systems; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Haar features; Kernels; Multiple instance learning; Visual Tracking; Weak classifiers; Feature extraction,"Sharma, V.K.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: vijay4247@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,9235965,,SPICE,,English,Signal Process Image Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011072050

For accurate diagnosis of related pathology, it has become necessary to develop new methods for analyzing and understanding this data.

Generalization ability of these systems is governed by the characteristics of dataset used during its development. It is observed that sub pathologies have a much varied ratio of occurrence in the population, making the dataset extremely imbalanced.

Driven by technological advances in sensing, wireless communication, and machine learning, WMS-based systems have begun transforming our daily lives. Although WMSs were initially developed to enable low-cost solutions for continuous health monitoring, the applications of WMS-based systems now range far beyond health care. Several research efforts have proposed the use of such systems in diverse application domains, e.g., education, human-computer interaction, and security. Even though the number of such research studies has grown drastically in the last few years, the potential challenges associated with their design, development, and implementation are neither well-studied nor well-recognized. This article discusses various services, applications, and systems that have been developed based on WMSs and sheds light on their design goals and challenges. We first provide a brief history of WMSs and discuss how their market is growing. We then discuss the scope of applications of WMS-based systems. Next, we describe the architecture of a typical WMS-based system and the components that constitute such a system, and their limitations. Thereafter, we suggest a list of desirable design goals that WMS-based systems should satisfy. Finally, we discuss various research directions related to WMSs and how previous research studies have attempted to address the limitations of the components used in WMS-based systems and satisfy the desirable design goals. © 2015 IEEE.",Education; health care; human-computer interaction; machine learning; security; wearable medical sensor; wireless communication,Artificial intelligence; Education; Health care; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Medical computing; Wearable technology; Wireless telecommunication systems; Diverse applications; Health monitoring; Medical sensors; Scientific community; Scope of application; security; Technological advances; Wireless communications; Wearable sensors,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23327766,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

This can be achieved by vertical scaling or horizontal scaling of attached resources. Live virtual machine migration of virtual machines across physical machines is a vertical scaling technique which facilitates resource hotspot mitigation, server consolidation, load balancing and system level maintenance. As live migration is triggered during heavy workload (hotspot) and its procedure takes significant amount of resources to iteratively copy memory pages from source to destination, it affects the performance of other running VMs hosted on the source as well as destination physical machine (PM). Hence to avoid such performance interference effects it is necessary to trigger the migration procedure at such a point where sufficient amount of resources will be available to all the running VMs and to the migrating procedure. It is also important to select such a VM which will produce less performance interference at the source and destination. This paper presents an intelligent decision maker to trigger the migration in such a way that it avoids the said performance interference effects. It predicts the future workload for early detection of overloads and accordingly triggers the migration procedure. It also models the migration procedure to calculate performance parameters and interference parameters which are used in the decision of selection of a VM. Experimental results show that it is able to increase the performance by 45%-50% for network intensive workloads and 25%-30% for CPU, memory intensive workloads when compared with traditional method. It improves the performance by 35%-40% for network intensive workloads and 15%-20% for CPU, memory intensive workloads when compared with Sandpiper method. © 2017 IEEE.",live virtual machine migration; machine learning; resource provisioning; workload prediction,Decision making; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Network security; Preventive maintenance; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Dynamic resource provisioning; Effective utilization of resources; Live virtual machine migrations; Performance parameters; resource provisioning; Virtualized data centers; Virtualized environment; Workload predictions; Dynamics,,Sanchez D.D.Lee J.-H.Pescador F.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Early identification of plausible transporters for a drug molecule can provide insights into its therapeutic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profiles. In the present study, predictive models for classifying small molecules into substrates and nonsubstrates of various pharmaceutically important membrane transporters were developed using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and proteochemometric (PCM) approaches. For this purpose, 4575 substrate interactions for these transporters were collected from the Metabolism and Transport Database (Metrabase) and the literature. The transporters selected for this study include (i) six efflux transporters, viz., breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), P-glycoprotein (P-gp/MDR1), and multidrug resistance proteins (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4), and (ii) seven influx transporters, viz., organic cation transporter (OCT1/SO22A1), peptide transporter (PEPT1/SO15A1), apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT/NTCP2), and organic anion transporting peptides (OATP1A2/SO1A2, OATP1B/SO1B1, OATP1B3/SO1B3, and OATP2B1/SO2B1). Various types of descriptors and machine learning methods (classifiers) were evaluated for the development of robust predictive models. Additionally, ensemble models were developed by bagging of homogeneous classifiers and selective fusion of heterogeneous classifiers. It was observed that the latter approach improves the accuracy of substrate/nonsubstrate prediction for transporters (average correct classification rate of more than 0.80 for external validation). Moreover, structural fragments important in determining the substrate specificity across the various transporters were identified. To demonstrate these fragments on the query molecule, contour maps were generated. The prediction efficacy of the developed models was illustrated by a good correlation between the reported logBB value of a molecule and its predicted substrate propensity for blood-brain barrier transporters. Conclusively, this comprehensive modeling analysis can be efficiently employed for the prediction of membrane transporters of a drug, thereby providing insights into its pharmacological profile. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Forecasting; Glycoproteins; Learning systems; Molecules; Peptides; Proteins; Query processing; Substrates; Breast cancer resistance proteins; Fusion of heterogeneous classifiers; Machine learning methods; Organic cation transporters; Pharmacological profiles; Quantitative structure-activity relationships; Substrate interaction; Substrate specificity; Computational chemistry; carrier protein; molecular library; protein binding; blood brain barrier; chemistry; information science; metabolism; molecular library; permeability; pharmacology; procedures; quantitative structure activity relation; Blood-Brain Barrier; Informatics; Membrane Transport Proteins; Permeability; Protein Binding; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Small Molecule Libraries,"Garg, P.; Department of Pharmacoinformatics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), S.

In MRRMC-FSVM, partial outcomes are later integrated followed by 'Cascade' mode of filtration in the MRRMC-FSVM. The approach of Cascade based MRRMC-FSVM can extend over multiple numbers of processors having a reduced communication overhead and needs very less memory, as the kernel matrices are way much smaller in comparison to a regular MRRMC-FSVM. In the present study, the experimental work implies the scope for integrating the previously known monotonicity constraints along with the framework of MRRMC-FSVM as it considered to be the potential way to overcome the scalability issue seen the datasets and accomplished greater accuracy while applying to classification challenges. © 2016 IEEE.",Data mining; Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (SVM); Map Reduce Framework (MR); monotonicity constraint; prior knowledge; regularization,Classification (of information); Data mining; Filtration; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Scalability; Fuzzy support vector machines; Map-reduce; Monotonicity constraint; Prior knowledge; regularization; Support vector machines,,Satheesh Kumar J.Devi T.Rajeswari R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The feature selection technique aims at removing the redundant or irrelevant features or features which are strongly correlated in the data without much loss of information. It is broadly used for making the model much easier to interpret and increase generalization by reducing the variance. Regression analysis plays a vital role in statistical modeling and in turn for performing machine learning tasks. The traditional procedures such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Stepwise regression and partial least squares regression are very sensitive to random errors. Many alternatives have been established in the literature during the past few decades such as Ridge regression and LASSO and its variants. This paper explores the features of the popular regression methods, OLS regression, ridge regression and the LASSO regression.

Web Applications as the new task-centric and action-oriented facilities have assumed a distinguished role in today's Web. At the same time, faults in these Web Applications are tedious and hard to test due to the labor and resource intensive nature of testing. Thus, making it essential to use automated strategies like fault based testing that can test the continuously advancing web. Fault based testing uses fault classification as a baseline to make testing cost-effective and efficient, hence making fault classification necessary. Fault classification in Web Applications is a course of action of developing models to segregate the various kinds of faults for real world fault based testing. Manual classification tends to be strenuous and therefore in this paper, we intend to predict an efficient automated model which will classify the faults. Our model uses Text Mining and Machine Learning technique to classify the faults of three open source Web Applications, namely, the qaManager, bitWeaver and WebCalender. We provide a comparative study among four models in which different Machine Learning techniques are used namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Multinomial Naïve Bayes. To analyze the performance of these models, Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained from Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and 10-fold validation are used. Results show that all considered Machine Learning techniques prove to be efficient in the classification of faults. Apart from this, analysis also shows that the performance of Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier is better than the other three classifiers. © 2017 ACM.",Classification; Decision tree; Faults; Naïve Bayes; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Text mining; Web,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Faulting; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sodium; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Swarm intelligence; Text processing; Area under the curves; Comparative studies; Fault classification; Fault-based testing; Machine learning techniques; Manual classification; Receiver operating characteristics; Text mining; Education,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

It initializes the weights of hidden neurons in a random manner and determines the output weights in an analytic manner by making use of Moore-Penrose (MP) generalized inverse. No-Prop algorithm is recently proposed training algorithm for feedforward neural networks in which the weights of the hidden neurons are randomly assigned and fixed, and the output weights are trained using least mean square error (LMS) algorithm. The difference between ELM and No-Prop lies in the way the output weights are trained. While ELM optimizes the output weights in batch mode using MP generalized inverse, No-Prop uses LMS gradient algorithm to train the output weights iteratively. In this paper, a comparative analysis based on empirical studies regarding the stability and convergence performance of ELM and No-Prop algorithms for data classification is provided. © 2016 IEEE.",Classification; Extreme learning machine; Feed forward neural networks; No-prop algorithm,Classification (of information); Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Comparative analysis; Data classification; Extreme learning machine; Generalized inverse; Gradient algorithm; Least mean square error; Stability and convergence; Training algorithms; Feedforward neural networks,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A huge amount of bug reports is submitted daily to bug tracking repositories. Although this practice assists in building a reliable and error-free software product but handling a large amount of work becomes challenging. Bug assignment, an essential step in bug triaging, is the process of designating a suitable developer for the bug report who could make code changes in order to fix the bug. Various approaches ranging from semi to fully automatic bug assignment are proposed in literature. These approaches are mostly based on machine learning and information retrieval techniques. Since the information retrieval based activity profiling approach achieves higher accuracy, they are more often used in recent studies. Time factor based normalization in activity profiling could play a vital role in analyzing the level of expertise (or knowledge) of developers as the knowledge decays with time. This paper proposes a time oriented expertise model, Visheshagya, which utilizes the meta-fields of bug reports for developer selection. The proposed technique is used to prioritize the developers actively participating in software bug repository on the basis of their current knowledge. The proposed approach has been validated on two popular projects of Bugzilla repository, Mozilla and Eclipse. The result shows that time based activity profiling of developers outperforms existing information retrieval based bug report assignment and achieves an improvement of 14.3% and 9.95% in the accuracy of top-10 list size in Mozilla and Eclipse projects respectively. © 2016 IEEE.",Activity profiling of developers; Bug assignment; Bug triaging; Mining software repositories; Time based expertise,Information retrieval; Learning systems; Activity profiling; Bug assignment; Bug triaging; Mining software repositories; Time based; Program debugging,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Even though software logging has numerous benefits this practice is underutilized because of lack of any formal guiding principles to developers for making strategic and efficient logging decisions. Logging should be optimized because too much logging can cause performance overheads; sparse logging can leave out vital information that might give clues to developers about the real issues. In absence of any formal guidelines developers rely solely on their domain knowledge and experience while making logging decisions. In order to lessen this effort of making decisions we have proposed a machine learning based framework, Logger4u for if-block logging prediction. We extract and use 28 distinctive static features from the source code helpful in making well informed logging decisions. We use Support Vector Machine (two variants, 1 linear and 1 RBF kernel based) models, Multilayer Perceptron with back propagation model and Random forest model in our work.

The algorithm used for clustering directly influences the results obtained from applying the clustering algorithm (clusters). Data clustering is done in order to identify the patterns and trends not identifiable from just looking at the data. Clustering may be supervised (if the machine training data set is available) or unsupervised (if the machine training data set is not available). Unsupervised clustering is usually done using k-Means Algorithm (using any distance, the most common being Euclidean and Manhattan Distance). The drawback of k-means algorithm for a large set are the rigorous calculations that need to be done to cluster a data set into multiple data subsets for every single iteration, thereby limiting its efficiency and use for large data sets. We propose a range based single pass clustering algorithm that clusters data on the basis of the range which it falls in, where the ranges are calculated using simple arithmetic mean between two values.

The existing training algorithms for SLFN are either gradient based iterative learning algorithms or non-iterative algorithms such as extreme learning machine (ELM). The iterative learning algorithms suffer from slow learning, under-fitting, over-fitting whereas in ELM input weights are randomly chosen consequently the classification using ELM is non-deterministic. The proposed DLM is a non-iterative algorithm in which input weights are derived from input space without finding any parameter experimentally and output weights are calculated as an exact solution of linear system. This makes very fast learning and deterministic classification. The feature extraction is performed in a multi-model way by integrating the face image pixels intensity and local entropy of the image. The resulting face recognition system is highly robust against ample facial variations including illumination, pose, expression and occlusion. The proposed DLM with multi-model feature extraction is evaluated on AT&T and Yale face databases. The experimental results clearly reveal the superiority of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.",Face recognition; Fast learning machine; Multi-model feature extraction; Non-iterative learning; Single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks,Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Lagrange multipliers; Learning systems; Linear systems; Pattern recognition; Face recognition systems; Fast learning; Iterative learning algorithms; Multi-model features; Non-iterative; Non-iterative algorithms; Single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network; Singlehidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN); Learning algorithms,"Vishwakarma, V.P.; University School of Information and Communication Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Sector 16-C, India; email: virendravishwa@rediffmail.com",Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

If a project hour got extended so accordingly cost will be adjusted. In the same way resources availability will be checked, testing will be done, labor cost will be considered likewise many more fields in the project will be predicted by these tools to get accurate cost estimation. By considering efforts of testing, quality of software and other factors as mentioned above will estimate the overall cost. To avail these advantages there are numerous mechanisms have been studied which uses machine learning techniques to estimate the cost in software models with certain specified factors. This software cost estimation techniques passes through various difficult phases to learn data which are imbalance in nature (ex-testing cost, resource availability cost, labor cost). Learning of class imbalance challenges supervised learning difficulties where particular classes have significantly more instances than others i.e. dataset having the majority and minority examples.

This crop however is affected by numerous diseases which cause significant yield losses every year. Early detection of diseases and proper identification of their severity will help to take decisions on proper usage of pesticides in terms of their type and quantity, which eventually will help in maintaining the crop health. In this work, we propose a system for classifying three diseases affecting grapes - Anthracnose, Powdery Mildew and Downy Mildew - and identifying the severity of these diseases using image processing and machine learning algorithms. The key contribution of the proposed system is to consider images of grapes leaves with complex background which are captured under an uncontrolled environment. We compare the performance of four machine learning algorithms, PNN, BPNN, SVM and Random Forest, for separating the background from disease patches and classifying between the different diseases. We also study the performance of different texture features like local texture filters, local binary patterns (LBP), GLCM features, and some statistical features in RGB plane for classification.

In this the agents are capable of learning from both their own experiments and other agents' knowledge and expertise. Implementation of CL is a complicated task in the real world. In distributed systems several agents cooperate to achieve a common goal or accomplish a shared task. In particular, if there are different people or organizations with different goals and information, then a multiagent system (MAS) is needed to handle their interactions. In this paper, various issues related with cooperative machine learning are studied and implemented. A new set of improved cooperative learning algorithms is proposed in the paper.

Learning a single level of dictionary is a well researched topic in image processing and computer vision community. In deep dictionary learning, the first level proceeds like standard dictionary learning; in subsequent layers the (scaled) output coefficients from the previous layer are used as inputs for dictionary learning. This is an unsupervised deep learning approach. The features from the final/deepest layer and representations for subsequent analysis and classification. The seminal paper of stacked denoising autoencoders have shown that robust deep models can be learnt when augmented noisy data is used for training stacked autoencoders instead of clean data. We adopt this idea into the deep dictionary learning framework; instead of using only clean data we augment the training dataset by adding noise; this improves robustness. Experimental evaluation on various benchmark datasets on classification and clustering shows that our proposal yields significant improvement. © 2017 ACM.",Deep learning; Dictionary learning; Unsupervised learning,Deep learning; Image processing; Learning systems; Unsupervised learning; Benchmark datasets; Classification and clustering; Dictionary learning; Experimental evaluation; Image processing and computer vision; Learning approach; Single level; Training dataset; Classification (of information),,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Many major ecommerce sites are collecting revenue from advertisements of products and creating better shopping experiences for customers with the help of such reviews. The problem of accurately verifying review authenticity steadily grows and can help in making or breaking the good name of a product. Feature engineering performed on the reviews assist in extracting the useful features that help in identifying actual fake reviews. Supervised machine learning algorithms help in classifying reviews into authentic and fake. The newly emerging phenomenon of personality prediction has taken hold of social media and this is being employed in the case of reviewer traits which will help identify key personality traits of fake reviewers. The Big 5 model is used for this which will be useful in tracking such people through their associated social media accounts. © 2016 IEEE.,content similarity; feature extraction; opinion mining; personality trait; product review; review deviation; social media; spam detection,Authentication; Customer satisfaction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Target tracking; Content similarity; Opinion mining; Personality traits; Product reviews; Social media; Spam detection; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

As a novel facet, digital governance intends to ensure and assure that stakeholders (government and citizens) have greater access and control over the governance mechanism which leads to a more transparent, accountable and efficient governance. Social media can be used to facilitate interaction between people and can offer a substantial, unparallel platform for extensive involvement of citizens in the governance measures. We propose using an ontology-based analytics on social media that expounds an intelligent governance model where sentiment can be mined for extracting views of citizens towards government practices, policies, rules and monitoring performance. The idea is to deploy ontology based techniques to determine the subjects/topics discussed in the tweets, which are related to Ministries of India: Their policies, rules, schemes, and analyzing the sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) for tweets retrieved (based on the concepts defined in Ontology). The proposed tool SentIndiGov-O proffers a sentiment analysis application model based on ontologies, where the ontology IndiGov-O is created for ""Ministries of Government of India"" to reinforce the feature selection task in a Naïve Bayesian classification paradigm.

Image processing algorithms have been deployed to automatically delineate various layers for autonomous width profiles computation. Classical OCT segmentation algorithms are anchored around gradient and its derivatives. Such pixel information can vary from subject to subject so prior approximations of different layers are imposed in the name of regularization. Regularization restrains the generalization capability of the model which is crucial for segmentation in pathological subjects. The presented approach aims to model signal interactions with a tissue type through back scattered signal characteristics. During prediction phase, given an unknown interaction, the model estimates the probability of signal being backscattered from a tissue type. Sensor's ballistic models are employed to estimate the uncompressed signal statistics. These models have been experimented and evaluated on 5000 AMD (age-related macular degeneration) and 5000 normal B-scans from Duke OCT dataset.

Most present solutions based on machine learning approach are inept for detecting the attacks in real time due to high processing overhead. In this paper, we present a defense solution referred to as DyProSD that combines both the merits of feature-based and statistical approach to handle HDDoS flooding attacks. The statistical module marks the suspicious traffic and forwards to an ensemble of classifiers for ascertaining the traffic as malicious or normal. Our method filters the attack traffic protocol specifically by allocating various protocol specific filter engines dynamically. As and when DDoS attack occurs and the load of a filter engine reaches beyond its capable limit, a new filter engine is recruited dynamically from the idle resource pool for filtering, thus guaranteeing the quality of service for legitimate users concurrently. We establish the effectiveness of DyProSD through several experimental analysis and real-world dataset experiments and the results indicate enough confidence in favour of our solution. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Artificial intelligence; Engines; Floods; Learning systems; Network security; Quality of service; Defense solutions; Distributed denial of service; Ensemble of classifiers; Experimental analysis; Flooding attacks; Legitimate users; Processing overhead; Statistical approach; Denial-of-service attack,"Boro, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tezpur UniversityIndia; email: deb0001@tezu.ernet.in",,Springer Verlag,9467076,,,,English,Microsyst Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969801210

However, current state-of-the-art for automatic latent fingerprint recognition is not as reliable as live-scan fingerprints and advancements are required in every step of the recognition pipeline. This research focuses on automatically segmenting latent fingerprints to distinguish between ridge and non-ridge patterns. There are three major contributions of this research: (i) a machine learning algorithm for combining five different categories of features for automatic latent fingerprint segmentation, (ii) a feature selection technique using modified RELIEF formulation for analyzing the influence of multiple category features on latent fingerprint segmentation, and (iii) a novel SIVV based metric to measure the effect of the segmentation algorithm without the requirement to perform the entire matching process. The image is tessellated into local patches and saliency based features along with image, gradient, ridge, and quality based features are extracted. Feature selection is performed to study the contribution of the various category features towards foreground ridge pattern representation. Using these selected features, a trained Random Decision Forest based algorithm classifies the local patches as background or foreground. The results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

According to Gartner Inc., the IoT will include 26 billion units installed by 2020. Smart security solutions, smart home automation, smart health care, smart wearables etc. are in-trend applications of IoT, and by the near future we expect to see its application to a city's transportation system or smart power grids. This paper presents a brief overview on different trends of the IoT and also discusses about the effects of the IoT on our day-to-day life.

Today the de facto standard for such reconstruction is compressed sensing (CS). CS produces high quality images (with minimal perceptual loss); but such reconstructions are time consuming, requiring solving a complex optimization problem. In this work we propose to ‘learn’ the reconstruction from training samples using an autoencoder. Our work is based on the universal function approximation capacity of neural networks. The training time for the autoencoder is large, but is offline and hence does not affect performance during operation. During testing/operation, our method requires only a few matrix vector products and hence is significantly faster than CS based methods. In fact, for MRI it is fast enough for real-time reconstruction (the images are reconstructed as fast as they are acquired) with only slight degradation of image quality; for CT our reconstruction speed is slightly slower than required for real-time reconstruction. However, in order to make the autoencoder suitable for our problem, we depart from the standard Euclidean norm cost function of autoencoders and use a robust l1-norm instead. The ensuing problem is solved using the Split Bregman method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Autoencoder; Compressed sensing; CT reconstruction; MRI,Complex networks; Compressed sensing; Computerized tomography; Cost functions; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Optimization; Signal reconstruction; Auto encoders; Complex optimization problems; CT reconstruction; Matrix-vector products; Real-time reconstruction; Reconstruction speed; Split bregman methods; Universal functions; Medical image processing,"Majumdar, A.; Indraprastha Institute of Information TechnologyIndia",,Elsevier Ltd,313203,,PTNRA,,English,Pattern Recogn.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84999015221

Such reduction occurs by eliminating some of the non-discriminating and redundant features and selecting a subset of the existing features with higher discriminating power among various classes in the data. In this paper, we formulate the feature selection as a bi-objective optimization problem of some real-valued weights corresponding to each feature. A subset of the weighted features is thus selected as the best subset for subsequent classification of the data. Two information theoretic measures, known as ‘relevancy’ and ‘redundancy’ are chosen for designing the objective functions for a very competitive Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) algorithm called ‘Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D)’. We experimentally determine the best possible constraints on the weights to be optimized. We evaluate the proposed bi-objective feature selection and weighting framework on a set of 15 standard datasets by using the popular k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. As is evident from the experimental results, our method appears to be quite competitive to some of the state-of-the-art FS methods of current interest.

The differentiation between weed and crop and weed removal are the two challenging tasks for the farmers especially in the Indian sugarcane cultivation scenario. The automatic weed detection and removal becomes a vital task for improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the agricultural processes. The detection of weeds by the robotic model employs a Raspberry Pi based control system placed in a moving vehicle. An automated image classification system has been designed which extracts leaf textures and employs a fuzzy real-time classification technique. Morphological operators are applied to extract circular leaf patterns in different scales from the leaf images. An optimal set of features have been identified for the characterization of crops and weeds in sugarcane fields. A weed detecting robotic prototype is designed and developed using a Raspberry Pi micro controller and suitable input output subsystems such as cameras, small light sources and motors with power systems. The prototype's control incorporates the weed detection mechanism using a Raspbian operating system support and python programming.

Intrusion detection is a cyber security mechanism that plays an important role in securing the network. Detection rate and false alarm rate are the challenging issues to design an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Various data mining techniques are used to implement network intrusion detection. Classification is a supervised learning which predicts the class label in the data set. Single classifier fails to obtain high accuracy. Base classifiers are not capable of detecting the attacks accurately. Ensemble classifier is a combination of base classifiers. Ensemble classifier outperforms base classifiers.

It was observed that the usage of the Siamese network to compute image similarity significantly improved the robustness of the tracker. Although the model was developed for underwater videos, it was found that it performs well for both underwater and human surveillance videos.

In most of the real life datasets, one object resides in many clusters with different membership values. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed for finding such overlapping clusters for knowledge extraction and future trend prediction. In the paper, multi-objective genetic algorithm based cluster analysis technique is proposed for finding the optimal set of overlapping clusters. As most of the real world search and optimization problems involve multiple objectives, multi-objective Genetic Algorithm is an obvious choice for capturing multiple optimal solutions. Thus the usefulness of applying the multi-objective Genetic Algorithm is to grouping the objects based on different objective functions for finding optimal set of overlapping clusters. The advantage of this algorithm is that it assigns a membership value only to the objects which are the members of several clusters, instead of assigning membership values for all clusters like fuzzy clustering algorithm. If any object positively belongs only to a single cluster, its membership value for this cluster is '1' and '0' for all other clusters. The overall performance of the method is investigated on some popular UCI and microarray datasets and the optimality of the clusters is measured by some important cluster validation indices. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 ACM.",Cluster analysis; Cluster validation index; Fuzzy clustering; Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm; Overlapping cluster,Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Education; Fuzzy clustering; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Cluster analysis technique; Cluster validation; Microarray data sets; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multiple optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Overlapping clusters; Unsupervised machine learning; Clustering algorithms,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Igneous rock is most abandoned rock in nature. The classification of Igneous rocks in its two types namely Plutonic and Volcanic is a complex and tedious job because of homogeneity between the classes. In geology this classification process has been carried out on the manual basis regularly, requiring high geological expertise. But being done manually can subject to error and leads to unnecessary delay. Hence for automating the process, pattern classification approach is used. In this paper a locally relevant database of igneous rocks involving both the rock types is considered for experimentation and testing. The grain size is considered as a discriminating textural feature for this classification problem followed by identification statistical features for textural discrimination such as Haralick features, and Laws Masks. A Radial basis function support vector machine classifier is used for the classification providing machine learning approach and giving reasonable results. But In Igneous rocks, the image classes are overlapping in the feature space. So the Classification accuracy can be further increased if the hypothesis of the multiple Support vector machine (SVM) image classifiers are combined to give a single hypothesis for the classification of an image.

The focus is to identify the emotion, a person is experiencing while listening to a song track. The aim of this research work is to analyze the lyrics of Hindi-language based songs, in order to detect the mood of the listener. We used unigram and term-frequency as the main features. The songs were reduced to a level where only relevant words will be used for mood-detection. We employ unsupervised machine learning namely topic-modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation model) for mining the mood out of every song in the corpus. We created our own dataset of 1900 songs consisting of Bollywood tracks, bhajans (spiritual prayers) and ghazals. A mood taxonomy is used to distinguish songs into Happy or Sad. Data is applied to LDA model to discover the hidden emotions within each song. At the end of experimentation, we compare the results with manually pre-annotated dataset for validation purpose and observe good results. © 2016 IEEE.",emotion recognition; Hindi lyrics analysis; latent dirichlet allocation; mood taxonomy,Data mining; Learning systems; Taxonomies; Emotion recognition; Hindi lyrics analysis; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Mood detection; Mood taxonomy; Term Frequency; Topic Modeling; Unsupervised machine learning; Statistics,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

On comparing results with original set and identified subset, we observe that the results are compatible. The feature selection algorithm is evaluated based on the components of efficiency and effectiveness, where the time required and the optimality of the subset of the feature is considered. Based on this, we are modifying the fast clustering feature selection algorithm, to check the impact of entropy correlation coefficient on it in this paper. In the algorithm, the correlation between the features is calculated using entropy correlation coefficient instead of symmetric uncertainty and then they are divided into clusters using clustering methods based on the graph. Then, the representative features i.e. those who are strongly related to the target class are selected from them. For ensuring the algorithm's efficiency, we have adopted the Kruskal minimum spanning tree (MST) clustering method. We have compared our proposed algorithm with FAST clustering feature selection algorithm on well-known classifier namely the probability-based Naive Bayes Classifier before and after feature selection. The results, on two publicly available real-world high dimensional text data, demonstrate that our proposed algorithm produces smaller and optimal features subset and also improves classifiers performance.

This work proposed a modified ant-miner algorithm to extract the classification rules from the data. Three benchmarked datasets (Cleveland, Pima and Wisconsin) from the UCI machine learning repository were used to analyze effectiveness of the proposed model. The obtained results clearly shows that the modified ant-miner outperforms the other top data mining classification algorithms like the CN2, RBF, Adaboost and Bagging in terms of accuracy.

The Training efficiency of both the algorithms is compared at the end of implementation. Logistic Regression is generally used for binary classification however; multiclass classification has been achieved by using One-vs-All approach. Artificial neural networks are used for feed forward propagation to build the hypothesis function and back propagation is used for calculation of weights. The weights for both the models are minimized using advanced optimization algorithm such as fmiunc and fmincg. The formulas are implemented in vectorized format that is the formulas are solely expressed in matrix form and nowhere for loops are required. Vectorization does involve a lot of formulations to be done on paper beforehand but it ultimately serves the optimization purpose because higher programming languages such as MATLAB are very efficient to implement vectorized codes and this property should be exploited. The database consists of five thousand handwritten digits. The final result shows the program predicting the number on the display.

Quality based classification of these products is being carried out manually in the industry which is tedious and expensive. Computer Vision systems can be used to automate the classification process. Automation can reduce the production cost and improve the overall quality. A computer vision system captures the image of the underlying object and transmits it to an image processor. The processor, after processing the image, presents it to a pattern recognizer. The recognizer performs the quality assessments and classifies the underlying object into pre-specified quality classes. Previous studies in this regard used minimal features to perform classification which reduces the accuracy. In the proposed approach more features are used which significantly improves the automation process. Automation process faces several challenges like identifying appropriate features and the best classifier. This study tries to grade cashew nuts based on external features like color, texture, shape and size. The effect of various pre-processing operations on the grading process is also studied.

But there are some problems related to it, one of them is Islanding. In this manuscript, a comparative study of different pattern recognition techniques using wavelet based features for islanding detection in distributed generation is presented. A system containing two DGs, one synchronous wind generator and an asynchronous hydro generator are taken into consideration. The model is simulated and wavelet transform is applied to extract the features like energy, entropy and standard deviation. Pattern recognition techniques including decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) and differential evolution (DE)-clustering are applied to segregate the islanding condition from non-islanding events like single line to ground fault, double line to ground fault, triple line to ground fault, load switching, capacitive switching, voltage sag, voltage swell and DG tripping. The comparative results show the effectiveness of each individual classifier for islanding detection in both noiseless and noisy environments.

Evolution of smarter grids in such environment requires accurate short term power forecasting for optimum power dispatch, spinning reserve planning, stability analysis and security evaluation. A variety of models, such as numerical weather prediction, artificial neural network, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian approaches are used for solar radiation forecasting. Processing time of these models is quite high for an accurate prediction. This paper proposes a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model without hyper parameter optimization and two optimized SVR models, support vector regression with optimized hyper parameters using Genetic Algorithm (SVRGA) as well as Particle Swarm Optimization (SVRPSO) for solar radiation forecasting. These models use similar day approach for prediction considering that position of sun and earth is same on a similar day in previous years, albeit with the difference of cloud cover, cloud movement, wind speed and temperature. When dependent factors on similar day of previous year remain same, solar radiation would be similar to previous years similar day values. Results obtained from these models show that these models have strong potential towards short term prediction, and out of these SVRPSO gives better results compared to SVR and SVRGA. © 2016 IEEE.",Genetic Algorithm; Mean Average Percentage Error; Particle Swarm Optimization; Solar Power; Support Vector Regression,Bayesian networks; Deep neural networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Vectors; Weather forecasting; Wind; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Numerical weather prediction; Percentage error; Renewable energy source; Short term prediction; Solar radiation forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Support vector regression models; Electric load dispatching,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015456241

We use rough set theory to reduce the dimensions of EEG data. In particular, we use discernibility matrix (DM) to compute an indispensable set of attributes of the data so that the attribute set is reduced before classification. We then use Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification of the EEG data containing only these attributes.

It's due to impairment of the arteries a veins located in the fundus of eye (retina) that are composed of light sensitive tissues. The aim of this research work is to design an efficient and sensitive tool for Diabetic Retinopathy using the images acquired from portable fundus camera. The screening tool is based on advanced machine learning and computer vision algorithm which includes patch level prediction. In patch level prediction algorithm will localize the diseased region in the Diabetic Retinopathy image like Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. The patch level classification uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning classifier model to predict the potential patch of Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. In this algorithm, the image is broken into regular rectangular patch. The feature for each patch along with the different class label based on the ground truth is computed and passed to strong classifier SVM. The data sets are split into training dataset and testing dataset. The classifier model is built on training dataset and tested against the test dataset. The performance results of rectangular patch level prediction using SVM the average performance for Hard Exudates was Accuracy 96 %, Sensitivity 94%, Specificity 96%. The average performance for Hemorrhage was Accuracy 85 %, Sensitivity 77%, and Specificity 85%. © 2016 IEEE.",Diabetic Retinopathy; Fundus Imaging; Hard Exudates; Hemorrhage; Machine Learning; Medical Imaging; Retina; Support Vector Machine,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Eye protection; Forecasting; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Diabetic retinopathy; Fundus imaging; Hard exudates; Hemorrhage; Retina; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015418399

The identification and classification of the named entities in a text into some pre-defined classes is known as named entity recognition. The commonly used pre-defined classes are the person name, place, name of organization, date, numericals, measurements, and so on. It is a subtask of information extraction and many other natural language processing like text summarization, text categorization, question answering etc. In the case of language processing of Malayalam documents no effective tools are readily available. Through this paper a named entity recognition for Malayalam language is presented. The system proposed follows machine learning approach using support vector machine integrated with fuzzy module for improving the performance. The design is a kind of One-Against-All-Multi classification technique to solve the ambiguity caused by traditional SVM classifier. The system is based on contextual semantic rules and linguistic grammar rules. Malayalam NER is a challenging work as there is no specific feature for identifying named entities like capitalization feature in English. Also no named entity tagged corpus for Malayalam language is available for training the system. The system defines four primary named entity classes, i.e, Name, Organization, Place and Date. © 2016 IEEE.",Fuzzy; NE class; NER; SVM,Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Information analysis; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Support vector machines; Contextual semantics; Fuzzy; Fuzzy support vector machines; Machine learning approaches; Multi-classification; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Text categorization; Text processing,"Lakshmi, G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of EngineeringIndia; email: lakshmi.g.geetha@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

In this paper, we explore the problem of convex formulations of multitask learning with sparsity inducing regularizers. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a novel first order iterative procedure (MTL-FIBM) which we prove to converge faster than previously existing work. Our method belongs to the class of proximal gradient-based techniques, where the loss function is considered to be smooth and the regularization function maybe non-smooth.

With the advent of Hadoop MapReduce, several distributed execution frameworks have been developed for data analytics and machine learning applications. Many of these frameworks are written in Java, Scala or Python and run on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), leaving them vulnerable to the performance impact of garbage collection (GC) operations. Application pauses induced by the Java GC are notorious in being one of the most important contributors of runtime performance bottleneck for a single process execution. These pauses are present in the distributed scenario as well, though in this case, it is significantly more complex to measure the impact of a GC pause for the overall execution runtime. Typically, in a distributed workload, a GC can result in delayed tasks impacting the overall completion time of the application. We present herein a novel way to preemptively trigger Java GC, stealing idle cycles, so as to prevent future tasks from being impacted by a GC pause during peak execution periods, resulting in improved overall application throughput. © 2016 IEEE.",Analytics; Big data; Cycle Stealing; Distributed Computing; Garbage Collection; GC; Java; JMX; JVM; Throughput; Virtual Machine,Big data; Distributed computer systems; Learning systems; Network security; Refuse collection; Throughput; Virtual machine; Analytics; Cycle-stealing; Distributed applications; Distributed workloads; Garbage collection; Java; Java virtual machines; Machine learning applications; Java programming language,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The agent achieves this with the help of a fuzzy rule base working on a variety of learning materials and recommending the appropriate learning path through them. In a learner-centric environment the learning behaviour of a learner may vary to a great extent due to the characteristics of the learner and his environment. Students are often misled while choosing the appropriate path of web learning tools owing to non-availability of a human teacher/guide. By the response of a learner to different positive and negative motivation factors the proposed system employs a fuzzy machine that is fed with realization parameters e.g. Satisfied, Depressed etc. The fuzzy machine working on the paradigm of fuzzy inference system processes these realization parameters with the help of a fuzzy rule base to produce the crisp measures of the learner's cognitive states in terms of Belief, Behaviour and Attitude. On the basis of these defuzzified crisp diagnostic parameters the proposed system will enhanced the quality of learning experience of an e-learner. To ensure this the system will provide more detailed discussion on the subject matter along with some additional learning tools. Learners often get confused to select the proper tools among various. Therefore the proposed system will also suggest most popular path among those learners with the same understanding. This recommendation comes from the analysis of data mining result. The system was tested with a wide variety of school-level students. The response obtained indicates that it is able to enhance the quality of learning experience through its recommendation. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Fuzzy rule based; intelligent agent; online recommendation; realization modelling; self-paced learner,Data mining; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Intelligent agents; Teaching; Diagnostic parameter; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy rule based; Learning materials; Learning objectives; online recommendation; Quality of learning; self-paced learner; Learning systems,,,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Recently, the use of search-based techniques have gained importance as they help the developers and project-managers in the identification of optimal solutions for developing effective prediction models. In this paper, we perform a systematic review of 78 primary studies from January 1992 to December 2015 which analyze the predictive capability of search-based techniques for ascertaining four predominant software quality attributes, i.e., effort, defect proneness, maintainability and change proneness. The review analyses the effective use and application of search-based techniques by evaluating appropriate specifications of fitness functions, parameter settings, validation methods, accounting for their stochastic natures and the evaluation of developmental models with the use of well-known statistical tests. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of different models, developed using the various search-based techniques amongst themselves, and also with the prevalent machine learning techniques used in literature. Although there are very few studies which use search-based techniques for predicting maintainability and change proneness, we found that the results of the application of search-based techniques for effort estimation and defect prediction are encouraging. Hence, this comprehensive study and the associated results will provide guidelines to practitioners and researchers and will enable them to make proper choices for applying the search-based techniques to their specific situations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Change prediction; Defect prediction; Effort estimation; Maintainability prediction; Search-based techniques; Software quality,Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Defects; Forecasting; Learning systems; Maintainability; Object oriented programming; Software engineering; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Change prediction; Defect prediction; Effort Estimation; Search-based; Software Quality; Application programs,"Malhotra, R.; Department of Software Engineering, Delhi Technological UniversityIndia; email: ruchikamalhotra2004@yahoo.com",,Elsevier B.V.,22106502,,,,English,Swarm Evol.

In this work, we present a novel efficient and effective empirical index that not only illustrates whether a distance function tends to concentrate for a given data set, but also enables us to measure the rate of concentration and allows us to compare different distance functions vis-á-vis their rate of concentration.

However, these optimizations view the whole run of a program in a monolithic manner. It is known that a program execution proceeds in phases - each phase corresponding to an identifiable set of control-flow behaviors. This implies that not all control-flows are hot (i.e. executed with a high frequency) all the times. Hence, if a program can switch among a set of hot paths for guiding the optimizations in the different phases, the optimizations may yield powerful results. We propose an algorithm that optimizes the clones of a function according to the different phase behaviors exhibited by the function, and dispatches its calls to the (potentially) most beneficial clone at runtime. This makes it possible to use profile information at a finer granularity than existing approaches. We start off by identifying critical functions that exhibit a high differential in its control-flow profiles, thereby exhibiting widely varying phase behavior. For these critical functions, we compile specialized clones that are tuned for each distinct phase behavior. Finally, we build a phase predictor that, at run-time, predicts the phase that a yet-to-be-executed function invocation would evoke (when executed), and guides the function invocation to the respective clone of the function. We build the predictor by learning a classifier over features extracted from the state of the program with the distinct phases acting as class labels. We demonstrate our algorithm by building a concrete phase-directed optimizer for register allocation (pdra) within the PBQP-based register allocator in the LLVM compiler infrastructure. We compare our allocator against the base allocator and a profile-guided allocator (pgra) that uses the profile information in a monolithic manner without extracting phase information. © 2016 IEEE.",compiler optimizations; machine learning; register allocation,Cloning; Learning systems; Optimization; Phase behavior; Compiler optimizations; Critical functions; High frequency HF; Optimizing compilers; Phase information; Phase predictors; Program execution; Register allocation; Program compilers,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Recently developed Multilayer form of ELM called ML-ELM which is based on the architecture of deep learning, become more popular compared to other traditional classifiers because of its important qualities such as multiple non-linear transformation of input data, higher level abstraction of data, learning different form of input data, capable of managing huge volume of data etc. In addition to the above, another good quality which ML-ELM possesses is its ability to map the input feature vector non-linearly to an extended dimensional feature space for giving better performance. This paper proposes an approach where unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering using kMeans and seeded-kMeans have been done in ML-ELM feature space. The empirical results of the proposed approach on two benchmark datasets outperform the results of clustering done in TF-IDF vector space. Also, it is observed that in ML-ELM feature space, the results of seeded-kMeans are better compared to the traditional kMeans. © 2016 IEEE.",Clustering; Extreme learning machine; ML-ELM feature space; Seeded-kMeans; Semi-supervised,Clustering algorithms; Input output programs; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Clustering; Extreme learning machine; Feature space; K-means; Semi-supervised; Vector spaces,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

So, there is a need for visual big data analytics which involves processing and analyzing large scale visual data such as images or videos to find semantic patterns that are useful for interpretation.

Analysis performed on 'dirty' data may lead to erroneous insights and thereby shaping decisions poorly. The aspect of big data that deals with its correctness is known as big data veracity. Trusting the data acquired goes a long way in implementing decisions from an automated decision-making system and veracity helps to validate the data acquired. In this paper, we present our solution to the big data veracity problem using crowdsourcing techniques. Our solution involves the use of sentiment analysis, which deals with identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. As a proof of concept, we have developed an app that requires users to tag tweets as per the sentiment it evokes in them. Each tweet would therefore get ratified by hundreds of our participants and the sentiment associated to the tweet gets tagged. The tagged emotion was then evaluated against the verified emotion as compared to a verified data set. This analysis was then plotted on a ROC curve and also evaluated against verified data using a Bayesian predictor trained with a trinomial function. As can be seen, an accuracy of 81% was obtained as displayed by the ROC curve and 89% through the Bayesian predictor. Also, a MAP analysis of the Bayesian predictor yields neutral sentiment as the most probable hypothesis. By doing this, we have proven that crowdsourcing of sentiment analysis is a viable solution to the problem of big data veracity and therefore an aid in making better decisions. © 2016 IEEE.",Bayesian predictor; Big data; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Tweet mining,Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Data mining; Decision making; Learning systems; Automated decision making systems; Bayesian; Map analysis; Proof of concept; ROC curves; Sentiment analysis; Tweet minings; Viable solutions; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this work, we develop a fault diagnosis system using time and frequency domain statistical features as input to a backend support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We evaluate the performance of the baseline system for speed dependent and speed independent performance. We show how feature mapping and feature normalization can help in enhancing the speed independent performance of machine fault diagnosis systems. We first perform feature mapping using locality constrained linear coding (LLC) which maps the input features to a higher dimensional feature space to be used as input to an SVM classifier (LLC-SVM). It is seen that there is a significant improvement in the speed independent performance of the fault identification system. We obtain an improvement of 11.81% absolute and 10.53% absolute respectively for time and frequency domain LLC-SVM systems compared to the respective baseline systems. We then explore variance normalization considering the speed specific variations as noise to further improve the performance of the fault diagnosis system.

Curriculum learning is a learning strategy aimed at training the neural network model by presenting the samples in a specific meaningful order rather than randomly sampling the training examples from the data distribution. In this work, we have explored starting small paradigm of curriculum learning technique for speech recognition. The starting small paradigm of curriculum learning is performed by a two step learning strategy. Training dataset is re-organized as a set of easily classifiable examples followed by the actual training dataset and the model is trained on the re-organized dataset. We hypothesize that by following the starting small learning paradigm the learning gets initialized in a better way and progresses to attain a better convergence. We propose to rank the toughness of the training example based on the posterior probabilities obtained using a previously trained model. Apart from re-arranging the training corpus starting small paradigm of curriculum learning is applied at model level. We consider the broad manner-class classification objective function as the smoother version of the phone class classification objective function. The model initially trained for broadclass classification is later adapted for phone classification.

In this paper, a novel hybrid model involving machine learning and signal processing techniques is proposed for the diagnosis of heart sounds using Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. A dataset comprising of 175 normal and 91 abnormal PCG signals is used. The authors propose a modular approach comprising of four levels of classification supported by preprocessing and segmentation. Preprocessing employs minimum statistics approach to suppress noise and enhance signal quality. At every stage of classification, the signal is characterized by parameters from its time-frequency, spectral and statistical analyses. In the first level, normal heart sounds are separated from the abnormal, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier having 91.11% accuracy. In the second level, an abnormal signal is identified as a valvular or nonvalvular murmur with 93.70% precision by employing SVM. The properties of Shannon energy envelogram of PCG signal is used in segmentation process to obtain systole and diastole segments. In the third level, these segments are analyzed for systolic and diastolic murmurs by thresholding, the accuracy being 90.61%. In the final level, systolic murmurs are segregated across Aortic Stenosis and Mitral Regurgitation with 83.89% accuracy by using SVM and diastolic murmurs are identified as Mitral Stenosis or Aortic Regurgitation with 100% accuracy by thresholding approach. Sensitivity and Specificity are used as performance metrics to achieve a robust and competent system. © 2016 IEEE.",cardiac murmurs; Heart sounds; nonvalvular; Phonocardiogram; valvular,Blood vessels; Cardiology; Dimensional stability; Heart; Learning systems; Phonocardiography; Signal processing; Support vector machines; cardiac murmurs; Heart sounds; nonvalvular; Phonocardiograms; valvular; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

The paper proposes a method of combining a series of Sparse Representation Classifier models using a network of Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVMs). One of the core ideas of the paper is that there exists a symbiosis between Sparse Representation Classifier and Linear Support Vector Machine. This symbiosis, we believe makes this ensemble of classifiers a very effective combination. This central argument of the paper is buttressed by empirical evidence, which displays the efficacy of the network of LSVMs in helping SRCs overcome their breakdown points. The paper discusses two important aspects of the ensembling framework: namely, diversity and percolation rate. Diversity is a measure of the ability of the series of SRCs to make uncorrelated errors, and percolation rate is the measure of the ability of the ensembling/combining scheme to pass the correct label as the final predicted label. The classification accuracy of the proposed ensembling framework compares favourably with traditional ensembling frameworks such as Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks on standard datasets. © 2016 IEEE.",Ensembling technique; Sparse Representation Classifier; Support Vector Machine,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Solvents; Vectors; Classification accuracy; Classifier models; Ensemble of classifiers; Ensembling technique; Linear Support Vector Machines; Percolation rates; Sparse representation; Uncorrelated errors; Support vector machines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this project, we propose to use a touch pad to construct a HAM radio interface. Low-power, short-range wireless communication interfaces which have become available with modern microcontrollers enable the construction of such systems which can allow users to exchange information within buildings. While Morse code was invented for telegraphy, its simplicity allows a person with physical disability to use it more effectively than a keyboard-based interface. Thus, such an interface can be useful in rehab centers, old-age homes and hospitals. Security systems are yet another domain where Morse code can be gainfully employed. Since the user must make use of touch, drag and release operations for Morse code signaling, it is difficult to prescribe any strict guidelines on the length of the drag or the time gap between two drags. Multiple users of the system will use the system at different speeds. We propose the use of Fuzzy logic with elements of machine learning to reduce the chances of misinterpreting the Morse code and adapting to different users. In order to demonstrate our project, we used the MSP430F5529 development kit from Texas Instruments which comes with a touch-pad, an LCD screen and an RF interface.

A modern storage system is a very complex combination of hardware and software elements and inferring its state from those of its individual components is practically impossible. Moreover, the state of the system undergoes continuous changes due to diverse and evolving workloads, frequent configuration changes and natural degradation in components. This paper presents an approach to predict the future response time of a storage system by applying a combination of machine learning techniques on the data of its internal parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the response time of a storage system directly from the time-series of its internal parameters. We present a systematic experimental setup for collecting the system data and for measuring its response time while loading the system with different standard workloads. Another novel contribution of the paper is a combination of time-series forecasting model followed by a regression model to predict the response time repeatedly in real-time. The said model is shown to be able to repeatedly predict fairly accurate 15-minutes-ahead response time values using the system data of the past 20-minutes' window. It is shown that the validation calculations typically complete within 30 seconds on an average using a computer of moderate configurations making the presented model applicable for practically reasonable prediction horizons. The design of the model is such that it can be adaptively tuned online at regular intervals as more system data is observed. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Forecasting; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Time series; Efficient managements; Forecasting models; Hardware and software; Individual components; Internal parameters; Machine learning techniques; Natural degradation; Time series forecasting models; Response time (computer systems),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

This results in errors and inefficiencies in port operations. The problem of automatic container identification and recognition is challenging as the ISO standard only prescribes the pattern of the code and does not specify other parameters such as the foreground and background colors, font type and size, orientation of characters (horizontal or vertical) so on. Additionally, the corrugated surface of container body makes the two dimensional projection of the text on three dimensional containers slanted and jagged.

Our system performs Naive-Bayesian (multinomial) and SSVM classification on collected tweets to identify the severity of the disaster. Based on location-to-interpolation cluster proximity, disaster geographic map is generated for the affected area. Our approach detects the tweets fitted into correct classifier label, and generate an output with detection rate of 79% to 91% of the time. The predicted disaster mapping results are highly accurate up to 89% for real time geo-parsed tweets that matched with actual location at-risk during the flood. © 2016 IEEE.",Crowd sourcing; Disaster management; Emergency informatics; Geo-coding; Geoparsing; Hash tags; Naive-Bayesian; Social media; SSVM classifier,Artificial intelligence; Disaster prevention; Floods; Learning systems; Location; Mapping; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Disaster management; Geo coding; Geoparsing; Hash tags; Informatics; Naive Bayesian; Social media; Disasters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

However, resource allocation for the system during deployment is a major issue which could either lead to bad performance or under-utilization of resources. In this paper we describe a QoS-aware architecture that manages resources for the distributed storage system to proactively and dynamically allocate resources for the distributed storage system to ensure that effective resource utilization and deliver performance according to the specified QoS. The architecture uses machine learning techniques to proactively predict and judge the performance of the system and make decisions for effective resource management for the database.

For measurement and analysis of social networking sites, we can assume it as a huge graph, where nodes represent users while edges represent links among users. Millions of nodes make the study of social network complex to analyze, so we narrow down by considering ego network rather than considering whole social network for our analysis. Ego network can be considered as an individual's own social network with their direct connections known as alters'. In this paper we are trying to identify the missing links among alters of an ego network with the help of Naïve Bayes classification technique considering it as a link prediction technique. Link prediction techniques are used to predict the possibility of creation of new links in the network. For predicting new links, existing link prediction techniques calculate similarity score between two nodes in the network. Higher similarity score leads to the possibility of new links between nodes. These techniques mainly use common connectivity information, node degree or individual node features separately to calculate similarity score which may leads to high number of false predictions. Secondly deciding threshold for prediction is another issue with the similarity score based link prediction techniques. Thus we have implemented Naïve Bayes approach by considering it as a binary classification problem to identify the missing links in an ego network. The proposed approach uses common neighbors and individual node features among its existing connections and based on that predicts the possibility of new links.

A high dimensional data consists of several features or attributes. These data may contain redundant and irrelevant features. The curse of dimensionality is an important problem in data mining and machine learning. In order to reduce the dimensionality of data and to improve the classifier performance, the unwanted and redundant features need to be removed. Feature selection techniques are used to identify the redundant and irrelevant features from the original set of data. Feature selection is the process of identifying most representative features from a collection of features. Existing feature selection algorithms like FAST, reduces dimensionality by removing irrelevant and redundant features from a collection of data and selects the required subset of features. The FAST algorithm uses information gain to calculate the symmetric uncertainty which is used as the measure of correlation between features. Information gain will check for only the presence of a feature with respect to another feature or class. But this will not give an accurate result. Thus the accuracy of results produced from the FAST algorithm is low. So a new Binary Krill Herd (BKH) algorithm is introduced for feature selection, in which a classifier is used as the objective function. BKH is a biological algorithm based on the movement of krill individuals. A binary vector is used to determine whether or not a feature will be selected, where 1 denotes whether a feature will be selected and 0 otherwise. The algorithm is evaluated a number of times with respect to the changes in the number of iterations per run, population size, problem dimension, and number of runs. The Binary Krill Herd algorithm not only considers the presence but also the change of a feature with respect to another or class. This helps to identify strongly correlated features compared to FAST algorithm. The proposed BKH algorithm has been compared against with FAST algorithm using several datasets. The datasets are derived from UCI machine learning repository. For the validation of the new algorithm, the classification accuracy is tested against several classifiers, mainly J48, Naive Bayes, Decision tree etc. The experimental result shows that the BKH algorithm for feature selection achieves more reduction in dimensionality by selecting only a small portion of the original features and outperforms FAST algorithms by producing more accurate results in less time. © 2016 IEEE.",Dimensionality reduction; Feature clustering; Feature subset selection; Krill; Symmetric uncertainty,Artificial intelligence; Bins; Bioinformatics; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Population statistics; Trees (mathematics); Dimensionality reduction; Feature clustering; Feature subset selection; Krill; Symmetric uncertainty; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

It is also known as opinion mining, mood extraction and emotion analysis.Social Media provides a good platform for people to share their thoughts, feelings and views. Social Media like Twitter is flooded everyday with tweets from users. These tweets can be effectively used for extracting mood of a person.Extraction of mood from texts is a challenging task as it involves understanding the underlying semantic. In this paper a new approach is been proposed that uses lexicon database to assign each word in a text a value called as 'Impact Factor'. The Impact Factor is nothing but how a single word is affecting the whole sentence in which it is used. Every word in a sentence has its own Impact Factor and it tries to influence the overall semantic of the sentence. Higher the value of Impact Factor of a word in the sentence, the more influential it is. The approach proposed in this paper makes use of lexicon based approach as well as machine based learning. It uses AFINN lexicon database to assign Impact Factor to words and Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayesian (NB) machine learning algorithms for training and testing the model.",AFINN; Emoticon; Impact factor; Lexicon approach; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Twitter social network,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Nearest neighbor search; Semantics; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Support vector machines; AFINN; Emoticon; Impact factor; Lexicon approach; Sentiment analysis; Twitter social networks; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

A set of algorithms can be used to get meaningful insights into the data that are helpful in making effective business decisions. Document clustering is one of the popular machine learning technique used to group unstructured data (text documents) based on its content and further analyze the data to understand the patterns in it. The unstructured data gets transformed into semi-structured data and structured data in stages by using text mining and clustering (k-means) techniques. Classification is another machine learning technique that can be implemented for use cases like 'fraud detection and cross-sell & up-sell opportunity identification' in banking, financial services and insurance industry. This paper focuses on the implementation of both document clustering algorithm and a set of classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes), along with appropriate industry use cases. Also, the performance of three classification algorithms will be compared by calculation of 'Confusion Matrix' which in turn helps us to calculate performance measures such as, 'accuracy', 'precision', and 'recall'. © 2016 IEEE.",accuracy; class variable or dependent variable; classification; clustering; confusion matrix; decision tree; document-term matrix; entropy; euclidean distance; feature variable or independent variable; information gain; inverse document frequency; machine learning; naïve bayes; precision; random forest; recall; supervised learning; term frequency; unsupervised learning,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Entropy; Image resolution; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Object oriented programming; Supervised learning; Text processing; Unsupervised learning; accuracy; clustering; Confusion matrices; Dependent variables; Euclidean distance; Independent variables; Information gain; Inverse Document Frequency; precision; Random forests; recall; Term Frequency; Clustering algorithms,"Yaram, S.; CSC India LimitedIndia; email: syaram@csc.com",Santhosh Kumar G.Poulose Jacob K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Businesses (or similar entities) need to identify the polarity of these opinions in order to understand user orientation and thereby make smarter decisions. One such application is in the field of politics, where political entities need to understand public opinion and thus determine their campaigning strategy. Sentiment analysis on social media data has been seen by many as an effective tool to monitor user preferences and inclination. Popular text classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM are Supervised Learning Algorithms which require a training data set to perform Sentiment analysis. The accuracy of these algorithms is contingent upon the quantity as well as the quality (features and contextual relevance) of the labeled training data. Since most applications suffer from lack of training data, they resort to cross domain sentiment analysis which misses out on features relevant to the target data. This, in turn, takes a toll on the overall accuracy of text classification. In this paper, we propose a two stage framework which can be used to create a training data from the mined Twitter data without compromising on features and contextual relevance.

Modern power aware systems utilize the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling mechanism available in processors to manage the energy consumption. In this paper, we initially characterize the energy efficiency of MapReduce jobs with respect to built-in power governors. Our analysis indicates that while a built-in power governor provides the best energy efficiency for a job that is CPU as well as IO intensive, a common CPU-frequency across the cluster provides best the energy efficiency for other types of jobs. In order to identify this optimal frequency setting, we derive energy and performance models for MapReduce jobs on a HPC cluster and validate these models experimentally on different platforms. We demonstrate how these models can be used to improve energy efficiency of the machine learning MapReduce applications running on the Yarn platform. The execution of jobs at their optimal frequencies improves the energy efficiency by average 25% over the default governor setting. In case of mixed workloads, the energy efficiency improves by up to 10% when we use an optimal CPU-frequency across the cluster. © 2016 IEEE.",CPU-Frequency Tuning; Distributed Computing; Energy Efficiency; MapReduce; Predictive Models,Distributed computer systems; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy utilization; Governors; Green computing; Learning systems; Multiprocessing systems; Parallel processing systems; Power management; Voltage scaling; Distributed processing systems; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Frequency-tuning; Map-reduce; MapReduce clusters; Performance Model; Power aware system; Predictive models; Energy efficiency,,Zheng R.Lovas R.Liao X.Shen X.,IEEE Computer Society,15219097,9.78151E+12,PIPSF,,English,Proc Int Conf Parallel Distrib Syst ICPADS,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018480554

The quality of Services (QoS) for securing cloud images were proposed in the earlier papers [2][3]. However, the key concern that still remains is how to balance performance and security. In this paper, a new and an intelligent model of QoS is being proposed which determines the files to be decrypted, without decrypting the entire file list in the secure wallet. Smart QoS is proposed as an extension to the security method proposed and presented in CCEM 2015[5] to improve the performance of Secure Cloud. The Smart QoS is capable of addressing some of the security concerns of cloud user community ensuring security and performance as well. Machine learning techniques have been used to design and develop the Smart Quality of Services. Solutions to ensure end-to-end security in cloud environments were proposed by us in the earlier paper [5]. In this paper, we have extended the security method proposed in [5] to ensure security and performance. Proposed Model is experimented in HPE Helion Cloud on two real time scenarios and results are attached to this paper. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Commerce; Learning algorithms; Quality of service; Balance performance; Cloud environments; Cloud infrastructures; End-to-end security; Intelligent modeling; Machine learning techniques; Security and performance; User communities; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

This increasing demand can only be attained with progressing technology. Internet of Things (IoT) is dramatically advancing the way we live our life by full-scale control over data with minimal human involvement. Using IoT to meet this high demand for production is achieved. In this paper we propose a bot that can be used for small scale farming in areas like gardens or backyard. A simple web application is provided for the user to decide the plants to be farmed and the bot does rest of the work. This bot can plant the seeds, water each plant at required intervals and even plot the weed to bury it. A database is provided with the information about several parameters to be taken care of for each kind of plant. Different sensors are used to sense the properties of soil and environment which can be used to anticipate the near changes and take necessary steps. Image processing is being used for detection and prevention of weed growth. We adopted Bayesian methods of machine learning to efficiently estimate the performance parameters by probability distribution. © 2017 ACM.",Bayesian statistics; Internet of Things (IoT); Machine learning; Shadow removal; Smart agriculture; Weed removal,Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Image processing; Internet of things; Probability distributions; Seed; Soft computing; Agricultural productions; Bayesian statistics; Integrated farming; Internet of Things (IOT); Performance parameters; Shadow removal; Small scale farming; Smart agricultures; Learning systems,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

The system is designed in the context of professional courses, such as from Applied Sciences, for questions that have an answer-key. The recommendation of a score is based on an analysis of the student's answer against an answer-key that comprises key phrases of the solution and alternatives, if any. We rely on five algorithms from literature on natural language processing to assess various aspects of a student's answer, such as the quantity and extent of match between keywords in a student's answer and the answer-key, while ensuring merely verbatim comparisons are not performed. The similarity scores are then combined using machine learning to output a recommended score for the answer. The system learns weights for the output of each of the five methods to map these to a score based on training data, comprising questions with answer-keys, student answers from actual exams and the scores provided by course instructors/graders. It is noteworthy that the methods presented in this paper do not rely on any kind of a corpus or prior-knowledge that is subject-specific.

HDR involves forming hypotheses, designing experiments to test the hypotheses, predicting the outcomes of the experiments, conducting the experiments to observe the outcomes and comparing the predicted and observed outcomes. HDR skill is important for core practices in science such as providing causal explanation for any phenomenon, designing of experiments and accepting or rejecting hypotheses. Few efforts have been made at the college level, especially in the context of biology, to develop HDR in learners. In order to address this gap, we have designed and developed a learning environment, Geneticus Investigatio (GI), to help improve learners' HDR skills in the context of Mendelian genetics. Affordances of technology enhanced learning environments such as agent-based modeling system have been used in the design of GI leveraging functionalities like variable manipulation, system-generated feedback and personalized practice which help learners develop this reasoning.

Extensive experimentation on real world datasets reveals the superior performance of the proposed model. We then non-Trivially extend our topic model to the scenario where the labels are provided by noisy crowd-workers and refer to this model as ML-PA-LDA-C. With experiments on simulated crowd, the proposed model learns the qualities of the annotators well, even with minimal training data. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Minimal training; Multi label classification; Multiple class; Real-world datasets; Supervised machine learning; Topic Modeling; Classification (of information),,Esposito A.Alamaniotis M.Mali A.Bourbakis N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Specifically we model the impact of preference for learning styles and the different motivations to learn on learner engagement in MOOCs. We propose that an inclination to learn new things, lifelong learning attributes and paying for a course will positively impact engagement. Treating learner engagement in MOOCs as a 'latent construct', we employ a Structural Equation Model (SEM) on a dataset of Indian MOOC learners to test our hypothesis. Our analysis shows that learners who indicate love for learning as a reason for learning are more engaged in MOOCs. The results also indicate that those learners who are comfortable with learning and understanding new things are more engaged in MOOCs. Learners who prefer learning by themselves show lesser engagement in MOOC learning. We have argued in this paper that the current discussion on learning outcomes in MOOCs is unidimensional in its focus on MOOC success as a 0-1 activity centered on completion. Learning is a multi-dimensional activity and in order to take our current understanding of MOOCs forward, it is important to consider broader aspects of learning and its outcomes. Measuring engagement and the factors that lead to engagement were a first step towards a developing a more holistic understanding of MOOC based learning. The results from this study - one of the first to focus on learner engagement in MOOCs - are encouraging as it proposes an alternate way to look at success in MOOCs. © 2016 IEEE.",Learner Engagement; Learning Styles; Massive Open Online Courses; Structural Equation Modeling,Curricula; Decoding; Education computing; Statistical tests; Learner Engagement; Learning and understanding; Learning Style; Life long learning; Massive open online course; Multi dimensional; Structural equation modeling; Student engagement; Learning systems,,Kumar V.KinshukMurthy S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

In recent times with the advent of modern technologies, this learning ability requires a different paradigm for achieving greater heights in traditional teaching-learning interaction. As an experimental example an augmented Oral Health Based Education System is proposed which is intended to impart knowledge to the children regarding dental health care and hygiene. The proposed work envisioned to identify multi-axis movement of the subjects in an intuitively interesting manner by exploiting the functionality of the Wii Remote. A quasi experimental design approach using pre and post-tests (on controlled and treatment groups) were used to assess the learning outcomes of children in cognitive domain. Data were analyzed using descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (t-test). Experimental findings and deployment of prototype demonstrated that there was a significant difference in children's achievement in treatment group post-test results compared to the control group post-test results. The results of the experiments showed that our system can successfully guide children accelerating the learning process in a playful environment. © 2016 IEEE.",3D modeling; Game-Based Learning; Tangible Learning System; Wii-remote,Learning systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3-d modeling; Experimental design approaches; Game-based Learning; Inferential statistics; Learning experiences; Mean and standard deviations; Modern technologies; Wii remote; Education,,Kumar V.KinshukMurthy S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Fixing of bugs detected in one clone require detection of all clones. Hence, it is imperative to identify and remove all code clones in a program. The focus of previous research work on the code clone detection was to find identical clones, or clones that are identical up to identifiers and literal values. But, detection of similar clones is often important. In the present paper it is proposed to generate the feature sets after parsing the given C program for code fragments and then match their similarity. On the basis of feature sets the classification of algorithm is being performed by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a machine learning tool. The output of the machine tool would be the similarity ratio with which the two C programs are related to each other and also the class in which they would occur. It was observed that the test results of the tool implementation show detection of code clones in the program and its accuracy increases with the increase in number of instances. © 2016 IEEE.",classification; Code clones; feature sets; parsing; support vector machine,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cloning; Codes (symbols); Learning systems; Machine tools; Software testing; Support vector machines; Code clone; Code clone detection; Code fragments; Feature sets; Machine learning techniques; parsing; Similarity ratio; Source codes; C (programming language),"Jadon, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: jadonshruti@gmail.com",Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

On time flight arrivals and departures are dependent on various factors including airport characteristics like the number of flights handled, ground handler's efficiency, disruptions caused by weather conditions, security alerts, queue times at immigration and air traffic congestion. There is a direct causation based relationship on delays, cancellations, re-schedule at the airport with passenger complaints and churn. Airports and airlines can infer signals of passenger satisfaction with the relevant events associated with on-Time performance and delays. Hub airports deal with high passenger traffic, connections and operational complexities hence they are good candidates for passenger service studies. In this paper, we had collected datasets for on-Time performance, flights for 48 global hub airports and passenger reviews about queue time. Further, we applied Logistic Model Trees (LMT) machine learning method for predicting the level of passenger satisfaction based on factors like an airport on time performance, the number of flights, on-Time ranking, average delays and queue time.

In the literature, it has been shown that document similarity method first compute similarity scores between the query and the documents based on a score function. Thereafter, documents are ranked according to their similarity scores. In the literature, TextTiling algorithm shown was basically done in three stages: tokenization into sentence-sized units, score calculation and detecting the boundaries of the subtopic. In this paper, we have evaluated two different approaches for documents ranking and further we checked this achieved results with other approach based on machine learning Firstly, Documents are ranked based on standard score calculation i.e using the tf-idf concept. Secondly, Documents are ranked based on Textiling approach. TextTiles have already been integrated into a user interface in an information retrieval system and have been used successfully for segmenting Arabic newspaper texts, which have no paragraph breaks, for information retrieval. Textiling is a far better technique than the standard score calculation when we try to summarize the documents. This helps in the improving the retrieval performance of the system. In this paper, we have shown the comparative analysis of two approaches.

Relatively less effort has been put to the development and analysis of features that are particularly suited for the task. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper proposes two features that can efficiently capture the emotion-related properties in music. These features are named compressibility and sparse spectral components. These features are designed to capture the overall affective characteristics of music (global features). We demonstrate that they can predict emotional dimensions (arousal and valence) with high accuracy as compared to generic audio features. Secondly, we investigate the relationship between the proposed features and the dynamic variation in the emotion ratings. To this end, we propose a novel Haar transform-based technique to predict dynamic emotion ratings using only global features. © 2016 IEEE.",affect; features; music; prediction,Forecasting; Learning systems; Signal processing; Accurate prediction; affect; Computational work; Emotional dimensions; features; Multiscale predictions; music; Spectral components; Multimedia signal processing,"Kumar, N.; Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL), University of Southern CaliforniaUnited States",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Hyperspectral image classification is an active area to allocate distinct label to each pixel vector so that it is well defined by a given class. For classification of HSI, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is extensively used. To improve the classification accuracy, spectralspatial preprocessing technique called Multi hypothesis (MH) prediction has been used prior to SVM classifier. This processed HSI will results in less intraclass inconsistency compared to original image and it gives robust classification in the existence of noise.

Hence there is an earnest need to develop an efficient machine learning classifier that can detect and classify anemia accurately. In this paper five ensemble learning methods : Stacking, Bagging, Voting, Adaboost and Bayesian Boosting are applied on four classifiers : Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network ,Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor .The aim is to determine which individual classifier or subset of classifier combination achieves maximum accuracy in Red blood cell classification for anemia detection. From the results it is evident that amongst the ensemble methods, stacking ensemble method achieves the highest accuracy. Amongst the individual classifier the Artificial Neural Network performs the best and K-Nearest Neighbor performs the worst. However the classifier combination Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor when applied on Stacking ensemble, achieves an accuracy much higher than the Artificial Neural Network.This indicates an ensemble of classifiers achieves much higher accuracy than individual classifiers .Hence to achieve maximum accuracy in medical decision making an ensemble of classifiers should be used . © 2016 IEEE.",Anemia; Ensemble learning; Red blood cells; Stacking; Voting,Adaptive boosting; Blood; Cells; Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Anemia; Ensemble learning; Red blood cell; Stacking; Voting; Decision making,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This objective is achieved by the analysis of physiological signals in conjunction with body position. The physiological signals that are analyzed are galvanic skin resistance and body temperature. Body position is determined by acquiring raw accelerometer data from a triple axis accelerometer. Acquisition of raw data is then followed by activity recognition which is a process of employing a specialized machine learning algorithm. Real-Time monitoring of data is achieved by wirelessly sending sensor data to an open source Cloud Platform. Analysis of the data is done on MATLAB simultaneously.

Internal adjustment in ANN deals with tuning of various parameters like learning rate, activation function, etc. Majority of activation functions that exist in the literature are transcendental in nature. In this paper, a novel parametric algebraic activation (PAA) function has been proposed. The function PAA is a generalized function of which Elliott activation function is a special case. PAA is a family of S-shaped curves and satisfies all the important properties of activation functions. This activation is employed on resilient propagation algorithm (RPROP) learning algorithm. Comparative performance evaluation with the widely known activation functions has been carried out on various benchmark datasets taken from University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Comparative performance evaluation in terms of number of epochs and testing error of the proposed PAA has been made with the standard activation functions.

The diagnostic accuracy can be limited by incompetence of the operating personnel, which can be supplemented by machine learning algorithms for classification of physiology and pathology. This paper uses effective information feature extraction, principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of multi-sequence MR images of 7 patients. All axial slices of the brain are classified into normal and abnormal images. Various methods for feature extraction were tested among which effective information yielded the highest accuracy of 80.8 in a set of 677 images used for training and testing. The sensitivity and specificity were 80 and 81.06, respectively. Different grid sizes were tested, and the highest accuracy was reported for 2 × 2 which indicates that the feature extraction must be taken over a small grid to ensure detection of minor variation from normal. The image sequences tested considered in the study are T1 weighted, T2 weighted, Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and post contrast T1 weighted. T2 weighted images were best classified with the maximum accuracy of 95.97. This method proved to be effective to classify the images of all four sequences with accuracy ranging from 92-96. The method was also tested with out of sample data and the accuracy obtained was 72.4. The novelty of this work lies in the classification of multi-sequential images using all the different slices of the patient which includes the top of the skull as well as the mandible. The slices differ significantly as the spread of the tumor varies with each slice. The slices are taken at 5mm gap and the tumor can have a thickness less or more than the slice gap considered for the scan. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets.

A hardware implementation was also demonstrated using a 2-array scheme with a cross-bar of memristors with asynchronous signals to show software equivalent performance [2]. Both learning and recognition (testing) were done with spiking neurons. However, simulating the neural dynamics for testing is computationally expensive which translated to high energy consumption in hardware. Also, the output is only a digital decision, namely the predicted class, which does not reflect the confidence of the decision. In this paper, we present a methodology for a quick and efficient performance evaluation - based on a DC analysis scheme termed as “Current Space” method implemented in hardware with a cross bar array. Here the input neurons produce analog dc voltage inputs for the crossbar array with learnt resistances (weights) to produce analog current levels at the output neurons. The relative current levels provide an analog measure of the decision i.e. extent of separation of classes (i.e. robustness) in the current space of the different output neurons as opposed to a digital decision based on vigorous vs. no spiking in the SNN network. This output signal is essentially equivalent to a software dot-product of input signals with the learnt weight matrix, as is done for ANNs. This method accurately reflects the classification accuracy of SNNs (correlation of 0.98). It enables fast testing (i.e. 15000× faster) in software which translates to a 25× energy reduction for recognition in hardware by our method compared to SNN based recognition. We show that robustness metric can be used to evaluate noise tolerance in the network to produce a training completion criterion based on immunity to noise. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Crossbar arrays; Neural networks; Noise-tolerance; Recognition; Robustness; Spiking; Supervised hebbian learning; Two-layer networks,Classification (of information); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Learning systems; Network layers; Neurons; Robustness (control systems); Software testing; Crossbar arrays; Hebbian learning; Noise tolerance; Recognition; Spiking; Two-layer network; Neural networks,"Prasad, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: sidharth52@gmail.com",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In order to achieve the ever demanding needs of customers, it has to rapidly evolve and include a number of changes. In this paper, our aim is to study the relationship of object oriented metrics with change proneness attribute of a class. Prediction models based on this study can help us in identifying change prone classes of a software. We can then focus our efforts on these change prone classes during testing to yield a better quality software. Previously, researchers have used statistical methods for predicting change prone classes. But machine learning methods are rarely used for identification of change prone classes. In our study, we evaluate and compare the performances of ten machine learning methods with the statistical method. This evaluation is based on two open source software systems developed in Java language. We also validated the developed prediction models using other software data set in the same domain (3D modelling). The performance of the predicted models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The results indicate that the machine learning methods are at par with the statistical method for prediction of change prone classes. Another analysis showed that the models constructed for a software can also be used to predict change prone nature of classes of another software in the same domain. This study would help developers in performing effective regression testing at low cost and effort.

This would help software developers to judiciously allocate the resources used for testing and maintenance. Software metrics can be used for constructing various classification models which can be used for timely identification of change prone classes. Search based algorithms which form a subset of machine learning algorithms can be utilized for constructing prediction models to identify change prone classes of software. Search based algorithms use a fitness function to find the best optimal solution among all the possible solutions. In this work, we analyze the effectiveness of hybridized search based algorithms for change prediction. In other words, the aim of this work is to find whether search based algorithms are capable for accurate model construction to predict change prone classes. We have also constructed models using machine learning techniques and compared the performance of these models with the models constructed using Search Based Algorithms. The validation is carried out on two open source Apache projects, Rave and Commons Math. The results prove the effectiveness of hybridized search based algorithms in predicting change prone classes of software.

We present a new algorithm for ICU mortality prediction that is designed to address the problem of imbalance, which occurs, in the context of binary classification, when one of the two classes is significantly under-represented in the data. We take a fundamentally new approach in exploiting the class imbalance through a feature transformation such that the transformed features are easier to classify. Hypothesis testing is used for classification with a test statistic that follows the distribution of the difference of two ?2 random variables, for which there are no analytic expressions and we derive an accurate approximation. Experiments on a benchmark dataset of 4000 ICU patients show that our algorithm surpasses the best competing methods for mortality prediction.

This paper proposes an efficient GA that seeds the initial population with gain ratio-based probabilistic framework. The gain ratio is normalized information gain of attributes and is not biased toward multi-valued attributes. In addition, the proposed approach computes the fitness of individuals from a pre-computed matrix of posterior probabilities using Bayesian framework instead of making repeated training database scans. This approach for fitness computation increases the efficiency of the proposed GA by eliminating a large number of database scans.

In a power system, disturbances like a fault can result in transient instability which may lead to blackouts. Early prediction of any such contingency can aid the operator to take timely preventive control actions. In recent times some machine learning techniques such as SVMs have been proposed to predict such instability. However, these approaches assume availability of accurate fault information like its occurrence and clearance instants which is impractical. In this paper we propose an Online Monitoring System (OMS), which is a GRU based RNN, that continuously keeps predicting the current status based on past measurements. Through extensive simulations using a standard 118-bus system, the effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated.

We propose a simple projected gradient descent-based method to estimate the low-rank matrix that alternately performs a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of the corrupted entries using hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using nearly optimal number of observations while tolerating a nearly optimal number of corruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing time complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an application of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even for moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an order of magnitude faster than the existing methods. © 2017 by the author (s).",,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Optimization; Hard thresholding; Low-rank matrices; Low-rank matrix completions; Matrix completion; Projected gradient; Sparse matrices; State-of-the-art methods; Time complexity; Matrix algebra,"Jain, P.; Microsoft Research IndiaIndia; email: prajain@microsoft.com",,International Machine Learning Society (IMLS),,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Examples include annotation of images with multiple labels, assigning multiple tags for a web page, etc. Since several labels can be assigned to a single instance, one of the key challenges in this problem is to learn the correlations between the classes. Our ?rst contribution assumes labels from a perfect source. Towards this, we propose a novel topic model (ML-PA-LDA). The distinguishing feature in our model is that classes that are present as well as the classes that are absent generate the latent topics and hence the words. Extensive experimentation on real world datasets reveals the superior performance of the proposed model. A natural source for procuring the training dataset is through mining user-generated content or directly through users in a crowdsourcing platform. In this more practical scenario of crowdsourcing, an additional challenge arises as the labels of the training instances are provided by noisy, heterogeneous crowd-workers with unknown qualities. With this motivation, we further augment our topic model to the scenario where the labels are provided by multiple noisy sources and refer to this model as ML-PA-LDA-MNS. With experiments on simulated noisy annotators, the proposed model learns the qualities of the annotators well, even with minimal training data. © 2017 by the authors.",Multi-label classi?cation; Multiple sources; Topic models; Variational inference,Crowdsourcing; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Websites; Crowdsourcing platforms; Multi-label; Multiple source; Real-world datasets; Supervised machine learning; Topic model; User-generated content; Variational inference; Positive ions,"Padmanabhan, D.; Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: divs1202@gmail.com",,MDPI AG,20782489,,,,English,Information,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020531483

We describe a new approach to balance data with improved classification. Resampling approaches is a group of popular and flexible techniques to deal with class imbalance, which attempt to resample the original dataset, by oversampling the minority class and/or under sampling the majority class the imbalanced learning problem, there are various methods that solve the imbalanced data at data level and algorithm level. The purpose of this paper is to present a more detailed analysis of density based cluster oversampling and under sampling techniques in terms of density based clustering. The concept of density based cluster sampling called DBCS is to use DBSCAN algorithm for discover clutters and apply oversampling and resampling in minority and majority class respectively. The experimental results of the hybrid DBCS algorithm are compared with an original datasets and other sampling techniques. The results show that the DBCS can improve the predictive performance of the classifiers.

From the extracted key frames, faces present in them are detected. These set of faces detected will be used as a training data-set which are stored in normal directory. The features from each of the face images are extracted by making use of Local Binary Patterns (LBP). The feature values will further be used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

If the weights of an MLP are not initialized properly, it may fail to achieve good generalization. In this article, we propose a weight initialization technique for MLP to improve its generalization. This is achieved by a regularized stacked auto-encoder based pre-training method. During pre-training, the weights between each adjacent layers of an MLP, upto the penultimate layer, are trained layer wise by an auto-encoder. To train the auto-encoder, we use weighted sum of two terms: (i) mean squared error (MSE) and (ii) sum of squares of the first order derivatives of the outputs with respect to inputs. Here, the second term acts as a regularizer. It is used to penalize the training of auto-encoder during pre-training to generate better initial values of the weights for each successive layers of MLP. To compare the proposed initialization technique with random weight initialization, we have considered ten standard classification data sets. Empirical results show that the proposed initialization technique improves the generalization of MLP. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Auto-encoder; Initialization; Multi-layer perceptron; Pre-training; Regularization,Classification (of information); Computation theory; Learning systems; Mean square error; Auto encoders; Initialization; Multi layer perceptron; Pre-training; Regularization; Signal encoding,"Pal, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, DurgapurIndia; email: tandra.pal@gmail.com",Martin-Vide C.Vega-Rodriguez M.A.Neruda R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Specifically, the bounds hold when the expected reward function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that naturally corresponds to a Gaussian process kernel used as input by the algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized concentration inequality for vector-valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly infinite, dimension.

In modern medical science, there are sufficient newly formulated methodologies for the early detection of leukemia. Such advanced technologies include medical image processing methods for the detection of the syndrome. This paper shows that use of a highly appropriate feature extraction technique is required for the classification of a disease. In the field of image processing and machine learning approach, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a well-known technique. Nucleus features are extracted from the RGB image.

Recent statistics from the Bureau of Labour indicate, back injuries account for one of every five injuries in the workplace. Eighty per cent of these injuries occur to the lower back and are associated with manual materials handling tasks. According to the Industrial ergonomic safety manual, Squatting is the correct posture for lifting a heavy object. In this work, an attempt has been made to monitor posture of the workers during squat and stoop using 3D motion capture and machine learning techniques. For this, Microsoft Kinect V2 is used for capturing the depth data. Further, Dynamic Time Warping and Euclidian distance algorithms are used for extraction of features. Ada-boost algorithm is used for classification of stoop and squat. The results show that the 3D image data is large and complex to analyze. The application of nonlinear and linear metrics captures the variation in the lifting pattern. Additionally, the features extracted from this metric resulted in a classification accuracy of 85% and 81% respectively.

Among the methods which handle class imbalance problem, undersampling is a data level approach which preprocesses the data set to reduce the size of the majority class instances. Most of the existing undersampling methods apply either prototype selection or clustering techniques to balance the data set. They are effective and popular, but both processes are complex. Drawbacks of the cluster based undersampling methods are: The quality of the chosen majority class samples varies depending on clustering algorithm, number of clusters and also the convergence is difficult. Drawback of prototype selection methods is that they have to compare each majority instance with it’s k nearest neighbors to decide which majority class instance should be selected/discarded which is not only time consuming and is also difficult to implement for large datasets. Proposed undersampling method MahalanobisCentroidbasedUndersampingwithFilter (MahalCUSFilter) overcomes the above said problems: parameter dependence, complexity and information loss. Proposed method is used in conjunction with c4.5 and kNN classifiers, and found to improve the minority class classification rate of all datasets with comparable overall performance for the entire dataset.

Traditional Automatic Speech Recognizers (ASR) perform poorly on dysarthric speech recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of deep autoencoders to enhance the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) based features in order to improve dysarthric speech recognition. Speech from healthy control speakers is used to train an autoencoder which is in turn used to obtain improved feature representation for dysarthric speech. Additionally, we analyze the use of severity based tempo adaptation followed by autoencoder based speech feature enhancement. All evaluations were carried out on Universal Access dysarthric speech corpus. An overall absolute improvement of 16% was achieved using tempo adaptation followed by autoencoder based speech front end representation for DNN-HMM based dysarthric speech recognition.

Widespread usage of camera traps has led to large volumes of collected images, making manual processing of visual content hard to manage. In this work, we develop a framework for automatic detection and recognition of individuals in different patterned species like tigers, zebras and jaguars. Most existing systems primarily rely on manual input for localizing the animal, which does not scale well to large datasets. In order to automate the detection process while retaining robustness to blur, partial occlusion, illumination and pose variations, we use the recently proposed Faster-RCNN object detection framework to efficiently detect animals in images. We further extract features from AlexNet of the animal’s flank and train a logistic regression (or Linear SVM) classifier to recognize the individuals. We primarily test and evaluate our framework on a camera trap tiger image dataset that contains images that vary in overall image quality, animal pose, scale and lighting. We also evaluate our recognition system on zebra and jaguar images to show generalization to other patterned species. Our framework gives perfect detection results in camera trapped tiger images and a similar or better individual recognition performance when compared with state-of-the-art recognition techniques. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Animal biometrics; Computer vision; Convolutional neural network; Detection; Recognition; Wildlife monitoring,Animals; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Cameras; Computer vision; Cost effectiveness; Error detection; Learning systems; Neural networks; Object detection; Quality control; Statistical tests; Automatic Detection; Convolutional neural network; Cost-effective approach; Individual recognition; Logistic regressions; Recognition; Recognition systems; Wildlife monitoring; Image processing,"Cheema, G.S.; IIIT-DelhiIndia; email: gullal1408@iiitd.ac.in",Ceci M.Dzeroski S.Malerba D.Altun Y.Das K.Read J.Zitnik M.Stefanowski J.Mielikainen T.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The goal of this work was to compare the performance of different classifiers tested on spatio-temporal features used to distinguish between true and distorted handwriting behaviour to detect deception using machine learning experiments. Dynamic handwriting features depict a writer’s individuality and neuro-psychic condition. Handwritten features share inter-class characteristics while a few of them are very unique to an individual writer. However, extraction of discriminating features & selecting them in decision making process with respect to an individual is really crucial and complex thing, which helps the construction of any classifier, aiming to build the decision support system. Spatio-temporal attributes carry significant discriminatory information in deception detection. In this work, a set of total twelve features (spatial and temporal with pressure measures) features were used from online handwritten data. Five different classifiers (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) were tested on these feature set with three separate factual descriptions: Person, Action & Event, in both true and distorted mode to develop a decision support system based on the outcome of the experiment on handwriting behaviour.

Traditional techniques are robust but might carry inherent bias of data scientist’s modeling skills. Machine Learning (ML) models makes the machine learn from the data and might not suffer from human bias. Some researchers argue that ML techniques can turn around model faster for big data, while others debate traditional techniques would still outperform when data is not so big. This paper tests arguments raised above in Oil & Gas (ONG) industry for actionable knowledge extraction on not so big sample customer data to predict customer’s campaign response. Our experiment reveals that on our data ML doesn’t outclass traditional modeling but is either slightly better or at par in terms of model accuracy i.e. percentage of instances classified correctly. It also establishes that though ML results don’t improve much on accuracy but some of them can be developed much faster. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Generalized linear model; Gradient boosting; Logistic regression; Neural network; Random forests; Traditional statistical modeling,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Database systems; Decision trees; Learning systems; Neural networks; Sales; Generalized linear model; Gradient boosting; Logistic regressions; Random forests; Statistical modeling; Big data,"Rajnayak, M.A.; Accenture Services Private Limited, Building No. 8, Tower C, DLF Cyber City, DLF Phase 2, India; email: mamtarajnayak@gmail.com",Tojo S.Nguyen L.M.Nguyen N.T.Trawinski B.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Extracted features represent the descriptive nature of the imaging modality for machine learning. Texture description, is one such method which is used to extract the informative aspect of the object. In this paper a new texture based feature extraction algorithm is proposed for extracting relevant and informative features from brain MR Images having tumor. Suggested algorithm is based on finding the texture description using nine different variants of texture objects. Subsequently, the intermediate texture index matrix is formed using texture objects with high pass and low pass spiral filters. The resultant two index matrix are used to generate the Texture Co-occurrence Matrix (TOM). TOM helps to extract the spatial and spectral domain features that forms the hybrid feature set for brain MRI classification. Using TOM, an experimentation is performed with a dataset of 660 T1-weighted post contrast brain MR Images having 5 different types of malignant tumors. Experimental results suggest that proposed method gives significant results in abnormality classification when compared with state-of-art GLCM and Run length algorithms. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

An efficient energy management strategy for smart homes results in minimized electricity consumption leading to cost savings. Towards this goal, we investigate the impact of environmental factors on home energy consumption. Home energy demand is observed to be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and humidity which are inherently uncertain. Analyzing the impact of these factors on electricity consumption is challenging due to the unpredictability of weather conditions and non-linear relationship between environmental factors and electricity demand. For demand estimation based on these time varying factors, a hybrid intelligent system is developed that integrates the adaptability of neural networks and reasoning of fuzzy systems to predict daily electricity demand. A smart home dataset is utilized to build an unsupervised artificial neural network known as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). We further develop a fuzzy rule based system from the SOM to predict home energy demand. Evaluation of the system shows a strong correlation between home energy demand and environmental factors and that the system predicts home energy consumption with higher accuracy.

We model each class-conditional distribution as an exponential family distribution and the parameters of the distribution of each seen/unseen class are defined as functions of the respective observed class attributes. These functions can be learned using only the seen class data and can be used to predict the parameters of the class-conditional distribution of each unseen class. Unlike most existing methods for zero-shot learning that represent classes as fixed embeddings in some vector space, our generative model naturally represents each class as a probability distribution. It is simple to implement and also allows leveraging additional unlabeled data from unseen classes to improve the estimates of their class-conditional distributions using transductive/semi-supervised learning. Moreover, it extends seamlessly to few-shot learning by easily updating these distributions when provided with a small number of additional labelled examples from unseen classes. Through a comprehensive set of experiments on several benchmark data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Vector spaces; Benchmark data; Conditional distribution; Embeddings; Exponential family; Exponential family distributions; Generative model; Unlabeled data; Probability distributions,"Rai, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT KanpurIndia; email: piyush@cse.iitk.ac.in",Ceci M.Hollmen J.Todorovski L.Vens C.Dzeroski S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Automation of repeatable IT tasks using software service agents that reduce human effort is therefore an important component of service management. A large fraction of the work done by IT service personnel involves troubleshooting of problems. However, the complexity of IT systems makes automated problem determination and resolution a challenging research problem. Using a database of prior customer problems and solutions, we build a system that extracts knowledge about different classes of problems arising in the IT infrastructure, mine problem linkages to recent system changes, and identify the resolution activities to mitigate problems. The system, at its core, uses data mining, machine learning, and natural language parsing techniques. By using extracted knowledge, one can (i) understand the kind of problems and the root causes affecting the IT infrastructure, (ii) proactively remediate the causes so that they no longer result in problems, and (iii) estimate the scope for automation for service management. In the future, a large cost differentiator for any IT company will often involve being able to build automated service agents from these technologies, which will result in a reduction in human effort. © 1957-2012 IBM.",Automation; Complexity theory; Data mining; Databases; Natural language processing; Noise measurement,Automation; Database systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Software agents; Automated services; Complexity theory; IT infrastructures; Natural language parsing; NAtural language processing; Noise measurements; Problem determination; Unstructured texts; Data mining,,,IBM Corporation,188646,,IBMJA,,English,IBM J.

The proposed method uses two stages of GANs to generate crisp and clear set of future frames. Although GANs have been used in the past for predicting the future, none of the works consider the relation between subsequent frames in the temporal dimension. Our main contribution lies in formulating two objective functions based on the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and the Pairwise Contrastive Divergence (PCD) for solving this problem.

Signals recorded using this procedure are termed as seismocardiogram or SCG signals. Analysis of SCG signals provides information about the functionality of the cardiovascular system. Performing an automatic diagnosis using SCG signals involves the use of signal processing, feature extraction and learning machines. However for such methods to yield reliable results, the digitally acquired SCG signals should be accurately denoised and free from artifacts. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of state of the art algorithms in denoising these signals. In our work, clean SCG signals were corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise and the signals were further denoised. Denoising using wavelet transforms, empirical mode decomposition, adaptive filters and morphological techniques has been considered in our work. Standard metrics: mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), signal to noise ratio (SNR), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), cross correlation (xcorr) and CPU consumption time have been computed to assess the performance the aforementioned techniques. From our study it is concluded that wavelet thresholding yields the best denoising and is hence the most suitable method for enhancement of real world SCG signals. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Morphological filtering; Seismocardiography (SCG); Signal denoising,Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Biomedical signal processing; Cardiovascular system; Gaussian noise (electronic); Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Mean square error; Noninvasive medical procedures; Signal analysis; Signal denoising; Wavelet decomposition; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Detrended fluctuation analyses (DFA); Empirical Mode Decomposition; Morphological filtering; Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Seismocardiography (SCG); State-of-the-art algorithms; Wavelet thresholding; Signal to noise ratio,"Sundar, A.; BITS, Pilani K.K.

Software undergoes changes due to maintenance activities initiated by bug fixing, improved documentation, and new requirements of users. In software, code smells are indicators of a system which may give maintenance problem in future. This paper evaluates six types of machine learning algorithms to predict change-proneness using code smells as predictors for various versions of four Java-coded applications. Two approaches are used: method 1-random undersampling is done before Feature selection; method 2-feature selection is done prior to random undersampling. This paper concludes that gene expression programming (GEP) gives maximum AUC value, whereas cascade correlation network (CCR), treeboost, and PNN\GRNN algorithms are among top algorithms to predict F-measure, precision, recall, and accuracy.

There is, literally, a huge body of literature which deals with the application of Fisher's discriminant analysis in problems of statistical classification and describes its desirable properties. The method is supposed to work well whenever there is a suitable numerical feature vector having different statistical distributions under the different classes. In this paper we will present some applications of FDA that discriminate between cipher texts in terms of a finite set of encryption algorithms. Specifically, we use ten algorithms, five each of stream and block cipher types, and, given a cipher text, try to identify which algorithm was used in the encryption of the given cipher. Our results display good classification with some of the features. Our limited study clearly shows that further exploration of this classification problem based on FDA could be worthwhile. © 2017, DESIDOC.",Classification; Encryption; Fisher's discriminant analysis,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Population statistics; Different class; Encryption algorithms; Fisher's discriminant; Numerical features; Problem-based; Statistical classification; Statistical distribution; Stream and block ciphers; Cryptography,,,Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre,0011748X,,DSJOA,,English,Def.

QA aims to extract an exact answer from a relevant text snippet or a document. The motivation behind QA research is the need of user who is using state-of-the-art search engines. The user expects an exact answer rather than a list of documents that probably contain the answer. In this paper, we consider a particular issue of QA that is gathering and scoring answer evidence collected from relevant documents. The evidence is a text snippet in the large corpus which supports the answer. For Evidence Scoring (ES) several efficient features and relations are required to extract for machine learning algorithm. These features include various lexical, syntactic and semantic features. Also, new structural features are extracted from the dependency features of the question and supported document. Experimental results show that structural features perform better, and accuracy is increased when these features are combined with other features.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms involving products are often used to improve the customer experience and increase revenue, e.g., product similarity, recommendation, and price estimation. The products are required to be represented as features before training an ML algorithm. In this paper, we propose an approach called MRNet-Product2Vec for creating generic embeddings of products within an e-commerce ecosystem. We learn a dense and low-dimensional embedding where a diverse set of signals related to a product are explicitly injected into its representation. We train a Discriminative Multi-task Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the input is a product title fed through a Bidirectional RNN and at the output, product labels corresponding to fifteen different tasks are predicted. The task set includes several intrinsic characteristics about a product such as price, weight, size, color, popularity, and material. We evaluate the proposed embedding quantitatively and qualitatively. We demonstrate that they are almost as good as sparse and extremely high-dimensional TF-IDF representation in spite of having less than 3% of the TF-IDF dimension. We also use a multimodal autoencoder for comparing products from different language-regions and show preliminary yet promising qualitative results. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Electronic commerce; Recurrent neural networks; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Customer experience; E-commerce ecosystems; E-commerce websites; High-dimensional; Intrinsic characteristics; Low dimensional embedding; Price estimation; Learning systems,"Biswas, A.; Core Machine Learning, AmazonIndia; email: barijit@amazon.com",Ceci M.Dzeroski S.Malerba D.Altun Y.Das K.Read J.Zitnik M.Stefanowski J.Mielikainen T.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance.

To be precise, we show how one can address the problem of finding persons over the globe whose current health parameters predominantly match with another person. Understandably, the health doubles of a person constitute a dynamic set, thereby making the problem more challenging.

Detection of spam e-mail is a difficult task due to several complications occurring in the process of exchanging information over a network. In this paper, we have demonstrated an approach for designing a spam filtering technique using ensemble-based bagging technique. The bagging technique classifies the e-mail message into either spam or not spam (i.e., ham). Bagging being an effective classifier is a powerful pattern recognition and machine learning methodology that is widely used in the literature. Our approach is tested for performance with other existing methods. It is observed that our method, i.e., bagging gives the better accuracy while classifying e-mail instances. Experimental outcome also exhibits that the framework using bagging technique, we attain better precision and recall. Choosing the optimal value of the parameters is a crucial criterion, and this was achieved by performing ten fold cross-validations. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Bagging; Classifying; Cross-validation; E-mail; Spam filtering,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Bagging; Classifying; Cross validation; Design approaches; Email messages; Precision and recall; Spam filtering; Spam filtering technique; Electronic mail,"Roy, S.S.; School of Computing Science and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: s.roy@vit.ac.in",,Inderscience Publishers,17548632,,,,English,Int.

Our framework consists of a latent factor model for the binary label matrix, which is coupled with an exposure model to account for label missing-ness (i.e., whether a zero in the label matrix is indeed a zero or denotes a missing observation). The underlying latent factor model also assumes that the low-dimensional embeddings of each label vector are directly conditioned on the respective feature vector of that example. Our generative framework admits a simple inference procedure, such that the parameter estimation reduces to a sequence of simple weighted least-square regression problems, each of which can be solved easily, efficiently, and in parallel. Moreover, inference can also be performed in an online fashion using mini-batches of training examples, which makes our framework scalable for large data sets, even when using moderate computational resources.

Feature subset selection is an important task in pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems. The generalization performance of the system is not only depending on optimal features but also dependent upon the classifier (learning algorithm). Therefore, it is an important task to select a fast and efficient classifier. Research efforts have affirmed that extreme learning machine (ELM) has superior and accurate classification ability. However, ELM is failed to handle the uncertain data. One of the alternative solutions is fuzzy-ELM, which combines the advantages of fuzzy logic and ELM. GA-FELM is able to handle curse of dimensionality problem, optimization problem and weighted classification problem with maximizing classification accuracy by minimizing the number of features. In order to validate the efficiency of GA-FELM, the comparative performance is evaluated by using three different approaches viz. 1. ELM and GA-ELM 2. GA-ELM and GA-FELM 3.

Instead of analyzing the absolute pitch or frequency, we analyze how one tone transitions to another in speech. Features (namely, zero crossing count, short time energy, minimum formant frequency, maximum formant frequency) are extracted using the tonal transitions over segments of audio signals. We have developed a multi-classifier system using four classifiers, namely maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), minimum distance classifier (MDC), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and fuzzy k-NN classifier to automatically identify tonal languages from audio signals. Initially, each individual classifier is trained with existing known data represented by the extracted features. The trained classifier is then used for language identification. Results obtained from these classifiers are combined to generate the final output. Experiments are conducted using three different tonal languages, namely, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese. The output reveals that the developed multi-classifier model is able to produce promising results. The extracted features produced better results in comparison to usually used frequency value (as a feature). Ensemble of classifiers is a better tool than using individual classifiers. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Classification; Language identification; Multi-classifier; Tonal language,Character recognition; Continuous speech recognition; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Natural frequencies; Natural language processing systems; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; Ensemble of classifiers; K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN); Language identification; Maximum likelihood estimate; Minimum distance classifiers; Multi-classifier; Multi-classifier models; Tonal languages; Classification (of information),"Ghosh, S.; South Point High School, 82/7A Ballygunge Place, India; email: annabelle.rosie00@gmail.com",Pal R.Ghosh A.Prasath R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

However, they are prone to overfitting and several regularization techniques have been proposed to mitigate this effect. In this paper, we propose the semi-supervised class sparsity signature based RBM formulation by combining unsupervised generative training of the RBM with a supervised sparsity regularizer. The proposed approach, termed as cssRBM, enforces sparsity at the class level to ensure that coherent and discriminative representations are learnt during training. Combining unsupervised learning with supervised learning allows the model to utilize external training data to learn better generative features while the supervised learning enables fine-tuning for discrimination using the learned features. We construct both DBMs and DBNs with cssRBM units and evaluate the performance on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 databases demonstrate that the proposed approaches are comparable with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in the literature. We also evaluate the performance on one of the most challenging face databases, i.e., the Point and Shoot Challenge dataset.

In this paper, we develop a 2-layered SNN model in MATLAB, based on Population Coding [4] and laterally inhibiting output neurons - implementing a Winner-Take-All mechanism [5] and train it under Supervision with our modified-STDP learning rule [2]. Supervision is provided in the form of negative bias currents to output neurons of the incorrect class(es). The network is tested on Fisher Iris and Wisconsin Breast Cancer databases, giving accuracy results (95.3% and 96.5% respectively) comparable to literature in SNN [6, 7]. The model is also simulated in a circuit simulator (SPICE) [3] to show software-equivalent performance (i.e. no performance degradation due to hardware implementation). For state-of-art SNN performance, the smaller size of our network (about 3x fewer neurons) translates to improved hardware density. Further, combination of the greater speed of convergence (i.e. 18x fewer epochs) and 3x fewer neurons and synapse, translates to equivalently reduced energy of learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Energy efficient implementation; Spiking neural networks; Supervised learning; Two-layer networks,Arts computing; Circuit simulation; Computer software; Differential equations; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Intelligent agents; Learning systems; MATLAB; Network layers; Neurons; SPICE; Supervised learning; Circuit-level simulation; Energy efficient; Hardware implementations; Performance degradation; Speed of convergence; Spiking neural networks; Two-layer network; Voltage-to-current conversions; Neural networks,"Biswas, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: anmolbiswas@gmail.com",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Sometimes this is a missing data issue, while in other cases it may be inherent, e.g., the records in different geographical databases may actually describe different product ‘SKUs’, or follow different norms for categorization. Often a tedious manual mapping process is often employed in practice. We focus on improving such a process using machine-learning driven automation. Record linkage techniques, such as [5] can be used to automatically map products in different data sources to a common set of global attributes, thereby enabling federated aggregation joins to be performed. Traditional record-linkage techniques are typically unsupervised, relying textual similarity features across attributes to estimate matches. In this paper, we present an ensemble model combining minimal supervision using Bayesian network models together with unsupervised textual matching for automating such ‘attribute fusion’. We present results of our approach on a large volume of real-life data from a market-research scenario and compare with a standard record matching algorithm. Our approach is especially suited for practical implementation since we also provide confidence values for matches, enabling routing of items for human intervention where required. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Competition; Data handling; Enterprise resource management; International trade; Learning systems; Mapping; Sensory analysis; Aggregate analysis; Bayesian network models; Geographical database; Global market share; Human intervention; Product attributes; Product categories; Textual similarities; Data mining,"Gupta, G.; TCS ResearchIndia; email: gupta.garima1@tcs.com",Moon Y.Kang U.Yu J.X.Lim E.-P.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Analyzing customer behaviour helps in modeling and recognizing purchase intent which is vital to e-commerce for providing improved personalization and better ranking of search results. In this work, we make use of user clickstreams to model browsing behaviour of users. But clickstreams are known to be noisy and hence generating features from clickstreams and using them in one go for building a prediction model may not always capture the purchase/intent characteristics. There are multiple aspects within the clickstreams which are to be taken in such as the sequence (path taken) and temporal behaviour of users. Hence we see clickstreams as having multiple views, each view concentrating on one aspect or a component of clickstream. In this work, we develop a Multi-View learning (MVL) framework that predicts whether users would make a purchase or not by analyzing their clickstreams. Recent advances in deep learning allow us to build neural networks that are able to extract complex latent features from the data with minimal human intervention. Separate models known as experts are trained on each view. The experts are then combined using an Expert-Attention (EA) network, where the attention part of the network tries to learns when to attend to which view of the data. Multiple variants have been proposed based on how EA network is trained. They are (1) Update only the weights of the attention network while backpropagating the errors. (2) Update the weights of both expert and attention networks while backpropagating the errors. (3) A context of each expert is fed to the attention network at intermediate layer besides the input fed at input layer. (4) Learn the EA network from scratch. Yet another challenge is the extreme class imbalance present in the data since only a small fraction of clickstreams correspond to buyers. We propose a well informed undersampling strategy using autoencoders. This simple undersampling technique was able to reduce the imbalance to such levels that the performance improvement was observed to be in the order of hundreds. Experimental results show that using EA networks there is an improvement of 13% over single view methods. Moreover, it was also noticed that MVL using EA network was found to perform better than conventional MVL methods such as Multiple Kernel Learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Attention; Class-Imbalance; Clickstream; LSTM; Multi-view learning,Commerce; Electronic commerce; Learning systems; Neural networks; Sales; Attention; Class imbalance; Clickstreams; LSTM; Multi-view learning; Network layers,"Chandramohan, T.N.; IIT MadrasIndia; email: chandramohan@cse.iitm.ac.in",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Compared to the high-resource languages such as English, Chinese, French etc., sentiment analysis task in low-resource language suffers due to (1) absence of annotated corpus, (2) tools to extract features. The present paper derives its motivation and addresses the sentiment analysis task for tweets in Malayalam, a low-resource language. Due to the absence of dataset, 12922 tweets in Malayalam language is collected and annotated to either of three sentiment categories namely positive, negative and neutral.

Nowadays, software companies spend approximately 45% of total cost in maintenance activities. Large software projects maintain bug repositories to collect, organize and resolve bug reports. Sometimes it is difficult to reproduce the reported bug with the information present in a bug report and thus this bug is marked with resolution non-reproducible (NR). When NR bugs are reconsidered, a few of them might get fixed (NR-to-fix) leaving the others with the same resolution (NR). To analyse the behaviour of developers towards NR-to-fix and NR bugs, the sentiment analysis of NR bug report textual contents has been conducted. The sentiment analysis of bug reports shows that NR bugs' sentiments incline towards more negativity than reproducible bugs. Also, there is a noticeable opinion drift found in the sentiments of NR-to-fix bug reports. Observations driven from this analysis were an inspiration to develop a model that can judge the fixability of NR bugs. Thus a framework, NRFixer, which predicts the probability of NR bug fixation, is proposed. NRFixer was evaluated with two dimensions. The first dimension considers meta-fields of bug reports (model-1) and the other dimension additionally incorporates the sentiments (model-2) of developers for prediction. Both models were compared using various machine learning classifiers (Zero-R, naive Bayes, J48, random tree and random forest). The bug reports of Firefox and Eclipse projects were used to test NRFixer. In Firefox and Eclipse projects, J48 and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve the best prediction accuracy, respectively. It was observed that the inclusion of sentiments in the prediction model shows a rise in the prediction accuracy ranging from 2 to 5% for various classifiers.",Bug report; Bug triaging; Mining software repositories; Non-reproducible bugs; Sentiment analysis,Classifiers; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Costs; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Life cycle; Software design; Bug reports; Bug triaging; Mining software repositories; Non-reproducible bugs; Sentiment analysis; Program debugging,,,Politechnika Wroclawska,18977979,,,,English,E-Informatica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020041168

This is due to the high spectral and spatial resolution of HSI data and lack of labelled data. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for phenotypic discovery based on autoencoders, which is trained using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixels. The distinctive archetypes from the learnt digital traits are selected using simplex volume maximisation (SiVM). Their accumulation maps are employed to reveal differential drought responses of wheat cultivars based on t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) and the separability is quantified using cluster silhouette index. Unlike prior methods using raw pixels or feature vectors computed by fusing predefined indices as phenotypic traits, our proposed framework shows potential by separating the plant responses into three classes with a finer granularity. This capability shows the potential of our framework for the discovery of data-driven phenotypes to quantify drought stress responses. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Autoencoders; Deep learning; Drought stress; Hyperspectral; SiVM; SLIC superpixels; t-SNE,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Drought; Hyperspectral imaging; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Pixels; Spectroscopy; Stochastic systems; Autoencoders; Drought stress; HyperSpectral; SiVM; Superpixels; t-SNE; Image processing,"Bhugra, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: eez138301@ee.iitd.ac.in",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The problem is challenging because depending on the event type, event mentions could be linked to a single data instance, or to a set of instances. The complexity of the natural language in the reports along with a lack of canonical names or verbose descriptions of the data instances to be linked, add to the difficulties. Given a user-highlighted event mention from a cricket match report, we solve the problem of linking it to a relevant set of balls from the corresponding match commentary. Our approach encodes cricket-specific intuitions broadly into the system design and more specifically as features for multiple classifiers for candidate detection. Further, we leverage techniques such as structured match, context similarity, iterators and sequential proximity of linked entities to perform the linking.

Mining associations among itemsets only by using support and confidence thresholds at different levels of hierarchical data would not give interesting rules both for binary or quantitative data. This paper proposes a two phase algorithm that mines rare generalized fuzzy coherent rules at inter-cross level hierarchies. During phase-I both positive and negative fuzzy coherent rules are mined and in Phase-II, rare generalized fuzzy coherent rules are extracted from the resultant rules obtained from Phase-I. The algorithm framework works on top down methodology in generating positive and negative fuzzy coherent rules and mining rare generalized rules from it.

Multilayer ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) which is based on the underlying deep network architecture is trained over this feature set to classify the sentences as important or unimportant. The used approach is unique and highlights the effectiveness of Multilayer ELM and its stability for usage in the domain of text summarization. Effectiveness of Multilayer ELM is justified by the experimental results on DUC and TAC datasets wherein it significantly outperforms the other well known classifiers. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Deep learning; Extractive; ML-ELM; Rouge score; Summarization,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Learning systems; Multilayers; Network architecture; Text processing; ELM (extreme learning machine); Extractive; Feature sets; ML-ELM; Multi-document; Rouge score; Summarization; Text summarization; Pattern recognition,"Roul, R.K.; Department of Computer Science, BITS-Pilani, Goa Campus, India; email: rkroul@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned model or causing the system make error only in attacker’s planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners.

Characterizing functional coupling among brain regions at these diverse timescales is key to understanding how the brain produces behavior. Here, we apply instantaneous and lag-based measures of conditional linear dependence, based on Granger-Geweke causality (GC), to infer network connections at distinct timescales from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Due to the slow sampling rate of fMRI, it is widely held that GC produces spurious and unreliable estimates of functional connectivity when applied to fMRI data. We challenge this claim with simulations and a novel machine learning approach. First, we show, with simulated fMRI data, that instantaneous and lag-based GC identify distinct timescales and complementary patterns of functional connectivity. Next, we analyze fMRI scans from 500 subjects and show that a linear classifier trained on either instantaneous or lag-based GC connectivity reliably distinguishes task versus rest brain states, with ?80-85% cross-validation accuracy. Importantly, instantaneous and lag-based GC exploit markedly different spatial and temporal patterns of connectivity to achieve robust classification. Our approach enables identifying functionally connected networks that operate at distinct timescales in the brain. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Players have multiple roles in a game of cricket, predominantly as bats-men and bowlers. Over the generations, statistics such as batting and bowling averages, and strike and economy rates have been used to judge the performance of individual players. These measures, however, do not take into consideration the context of the game in which a player per-formed. Furthermore, these types of statistics are incapable of comparing the performance of players across different roles. In this paper, we present an approach to quantitatively assess the performances of individual play-ers in single match of One Day International (ODI) cricket. For this, we have developed a new measure, called the Work Index, which represents the amount of work that is yet to be done by a team to achieve its tar-get. Our approach incorporates game situations and the team strengths to measure the player contributions. This not only helps us in evaluat-ing the individual performances, but also enables us to compare players within and across various roles on a common scale. Using the player performances in a match, we predict the player of the match award for the ODI matches played between 2006 and 2016.

They serve as gateways to draw students into the course. In going over these videos accumulating knowledge, there is a high occurrence of cases [1] where the learner forgets about some of the concepts taught and focus more on what is the minimum amount knowledge needed to carry forward to attempt the quizzes and pass. This is a step backward when we are concerned with giving the learner a learning outcome that seems to bridge the gap between what he knew before and after the course to completion. To address this issue, we are proposing an interaction model that enables the learner to promptly take notes as and when the video is being viewed. The work contains a functional prototype of the application for taking personalized notes from MOOC contents. The work [12] is an integration of several world leading MOOC providers content using application program interface(API) and a customize interface module for searching courses from multiple MOOC providers as COURSEEKA and personalised note taking module as MOOKbook.

There are many real-life applications (like smart city planning and urban development) where public (skilled or unskilled) opinions play a better role in comparison with single expert opinion. A spectrum of algorithms has already been proposed for obtaining robust consensus judgment from multiple crowd opinions. In most of the problems, for a particular question we receive a single opinion with multiple options. But in this article, we have proposed a new research problem termed as constrained judgment analysis problem that consists of the questions having multiple opinions. Moreover, some constraints among the options are required to be satisfied while giving opinions. In this constrained judgment analysis, the traditional way of decision making, like majority voting, weighted voting or probablistic model, cannot be applied directly due to the purpose of constraint satisfaction. In this work, we have also proposed a probabilistic method for obtaining final solution for constrained judgment analysis problem and demonstrated its efficacy over a synthetic dataset, thereby proving its utility in resource allocation for smart city planning. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This is due to the short text length of the abstracts. Also, abstracts are a general discussion of the topic with few domain specific terms. These reasons make it hard to generate good representations of abstracts which in turn leads to poor categorization performance. To address this challenge, external Knowledge Bases (KB) like Wikipedia, Freebase etc. can be used to enrich the representations for abstracts, which can aid in the categorization task. In this work, we propose a novel method for enhancing classification performance of research papers into ACM computer science categories using knowledge extracted from related Wikipedia articles and Freebase entities.

The advantage of cloud-based environment over physical environment is that, it provides scalable virtual resources on demand and thus makes it suitable for handling increase in volume of the data. The various hidden patterns in data can provide knowledge bases for decision making. The statistical or data mining based methods can be used for finding knowledge patterns. Among the decision tree based classification algorithms, implementable in distributed environment, an efficient algorithm can be selected based on few parameters such as execution time, accuracy of prediction and complexity of the tree structure. In this study, Apache Hadoop-based distributed environment is established on virtual machine. Apache Spark is installed to execute machine learning algorithms. The comparative study of binary classification methods such as decision tree, gradient boosted tree and random forest tree is performed to judge their performances on the basis of defined parameters. It is found that Random forest tree performs best among all three algorithms for the considered dataset. © 2017 The Author(s).",Binary classification; Decision tree; Gradient boosted tree; Massive data; Random forest tree,Binary trees; Classification (of information); Computer software; Decision making; Decision trees; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Virtual machine; Binary classification; Binary classification methods; Classification algorithm; Comparative studies; Distributed environments; Massive data; Physical environments; Random forests; Data mining,"Naik, N.; Dr. BMN CollegeIndia; email: neelamnaik08@gmail.com",Toro C.Hicks Y.Howlett R.J.Zanni-Merk C.Toro C.Frydman C.Jain L.C.Jain L.C.,Elsevier B.V.,18770509,,,,English,Procedia Comput.

The transfer of knowledge from one domain to another requires similarity between two domains. In many resource-poor languages, it is rare to find labeled training data in both the source and target domains. Active learning algorithms, which query more labels from an oracle, can be used effectively in training the source domain when an oracle is available in the source domain but not available in the target domain. Active learning strategies are subjective as they are designed by humans. It can be time consuming to design a strategy and it can vary from one human to other. To tackle all these problems, we design a learning algorithm that connects transfer learning and active learning with the well-known multi-armed bandit problem by querying the most valuable information from the source domain. The advantage of our method is that we get the best active query selection using active learning with multi arm and distribution matching between two domains in conjunction with transfer learning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by running experiments on three Telugu language domain-specific datasets for sentiment analysis.",Active learning; Multi-arm bandit; Transfer learning,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Active Learning; Active learning strategies; Active-learning algorithm; Labeled training data; Limited training data; Multi-arm bandit; Multi-armed bandit problem; Transfer learning; Learning algorithms,,Polikar R.Sick B.Kottke D.Krempl G.Calma A.Lemaire V.,CEUR-WS,16130073,,,,English,CEUR Workshop Proc.,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030123949

Application of these techniques helps in assessing the significance of causal factors on spatial events. This work attempts to identify the hotspots of possible randomness in terms of land use / cover changes using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. Transformations in an urban landscape pattern are a consequence of congregation of different spatial and aspatial factors. Furthermore, there is a huge possibility that the characteristics of these factors may vary in spatio-temporal domain. Hence, it is difficult to investigate an urban event using a unidimensional approach. Non-linearity of urban events can be tackled using techniques which are effective in considering and representing the possible transitions of causal factors from one state to another with probabilistic / possibilistic values. Hence, Bayesian model is employed in this study using historical and current data sets. Firstly, the study area is segregated into different grids. Spatiotemporal assessment of land use / cover changes and transition of LULC class from one to another is performed for the years between 1992 and 2014 for each grid. Then, current landscape pattern is quantified using a proposed landscape indices termed as fuzzy -Shannon’s heterogeneity index for different grids. It is developed by modifying conventional Shannon’s heterogeneity index. The results obtained from the application of fuzzy-Shannon’s heterogeneity indexand spatiotemporal assessment of LULC changes and transition of LULC class from one to another are fed into the Bayesian model to determine the land use / cover changes hotspots. Results of the Bayesian model a lso help in identifying the factors which are the most significant actors in inducing randomness in LULC transformation.

In today’s web based world, the methodology is becoming clichéd against the flipped classroom approach based on video lectures, podcasts, and personalized home-based e-learning with discussion and practical applications in the classroom. Both methods need a teacher but there is a significant difference between the outcomes of learning for students. In India where there are many students in a classroom, an authoritative approach helps in reaching the mass. It supports the learning of the students where the learners are on same platform and taught from basics and all equally. One cannot ignore the benefits of flipped classroom which has an essence of covering more content and in more versatile way. However, in this exercise the few learners can be benefitted and few can lose on their learning due to no preparation of content at home. In India, the learner does not get a choice based grading education system always. Learner needs constant guidance, assistance and sometimes forceful dissemination of knowledge. According to Blooms Taxonomy first 2 levels of learning are remember and understand. Though they are being taken as the lowest levels of the triangle, they are the main base of learner’s foundation system. Hence using application based learning from flip classroom and an authoritative approach for firming the fundamentals with mass would make learning extremely interesting and fruitful. For this paper the class sample size of 100 was divided equally among traditional and flipped classroom method. Both the learning’s were compared and carefully studied. This paper tries to highlight on the traditional ways along with modern techniques which leads to progressive teaching learning process. © 2017 ACRS.

To analyze and compare the work done by the researchers on predicting defects of software system, it is necessary to have a look on their varied work. The most frequently used methodologies for predicting defects in the software system have been highlighted in this paper and it has been observed that use of public datasets were considerably more than use of private datasets.

These are four layer networks with input, hidden, output and decision layers. The RBFNNs require single iteration for training the network. On the other side, it suffers from growing hidden layer size on par with training dataset. Though various attempts have been made to solve this issue by clustering the input data. But, in a given dataset estimating the optimal number of clusters is unknown and also it involves more computational time. Hence, to address this problem in this paper, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based clustering methodology has been proposed. In this context, we introduce a measure in the objective function of PSO, which allows us to measure the quality of wide range of clusters without prior information. Next, this PSO-based clustering methodology yields a set of High-Performance Cluster Centers (HPCCs). The proposed method experimented on three medical datasets.

In order to capture the learning and prediction problems accurately structural constraints such as sparsity or low rank are frequently imposed or else the objective itself is designed to be a non-convex function. This is especially true of algorithms that operate in high-dimensional spaces or that train non-linear models such as tensor models and deep networks. The freedom to express the learning problem as a non-convex optimization problem gives immense modeling power to the algorithm designer, but often such problems are NP-hard to solve. A popular workaround to this has been to relax non-convex problems to convex ones and use traditional methods to solve the (convex) relaxed optimization problems. However this approach may be lossy and nevertheless presents significant challenges for large scale optimization. On the other hand, direct approaches to non-convex optimization have met with resounding success in several domains and remain the methods of choice for the practitioner, as they frequently outperform relaxation-based techniques - popular heuristics include projected gradient descent and alternating minimization. However, these are often poorly understood in terms of their convergence and other properties. This monograph presents a selection of recent advances that bridge a long-standing gap in our understanding of these heuristics. We hope that an insight into the inner workings of these methods will allow the reader to appreciate the unique marriage of task structure and generative models that allow these heuristic techniques to (provably) succeed. The monograph will lead the reader through several widely used non-convex optimization techniques, as well as applications thereof. The goal of this monograph is to both, introduce the rich literature in this area, as well as equip the reader with the tools and techniques needed to analyze these simple procedures for non-convex problems. © 2017 P.

An image is a very rich and high dimensional data structure, which can result into a considerable computation when processed upon directly. Various feature extraction techniques have been proposed to represent the images efficiently in lower dimension which is understandable by the computer. In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Haar wavelet-based approach, which extracts salient features from prominent face regions at two different scales. The approach first segments most informative geometric components such as eye, mouth, etc. using the Adaboost cascade object detector. Segmented components are divided in M × N regions and feature vector is obtained by concatenating local Haar features extracted from each region. Feature vector is projected in Linear Discriminant Analysis space to reduce its size. For classification, we used template matching (Chi-Square and Cosine measure) and machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine). Performance of proposed method is evaluated on various well-known data-sets like CK, Japanese Female Facial Expression, and Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database. Adaptability of the feature is also tested on in-house Web-Enabled Spontaneous Facial Expression Data-set (WESFED).

For efficient detection of Android malwares, different static and dynamic malware detection methods have been proposed. One of the popular methods of static detection technique is permission/feature-based detection of malwares through AndroidManifest.xml file using machine learning classifiers. But ignoring important feature or keeping irrelevant features may specifically cause mystification for classification algorithms. So to reduce classification time and improvement of accuracy different feature reduction tools have been used in different literature. In this work, we have proposed a framework that extracts the permission features of manifest files, generates feature vectors and uses six different feature ranking tools to create separate feature reducts. On those feature reducts different machine learning classifiers of Data Mining Tool, Weka have been used to classify android applications. We have evaluated our method on a set of total 734 applications (504 benign, 231 malwares) and results show that highest TPR rate observed is 98.01% while accuracy is up to 87.99% and highest F1 score is 0.9189. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Android; Classification; Feature ranking; Feature reduction; Malwares; Static detection,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Computer crime; Data mining; Feature extraction; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Malware; Smartphones; Android; Feature ranking; Feature reduction; Malwares; Static detections; Android (operating system),"Bhattacharya, A.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Institute of Engineering & ManagementIndia; email: abhishek.bhattacharya@iemcal.com",Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Based on density of human activity over built-up area, this paper attempts to redefine the rate of national urbanisation as well as provide a more granular assessment of state and district level urban sprawl. (Gridded Population: GHSL Human activity is defined as a weighted combination of nightlights (VIIRS) and micro population). Built-up data is extracted from GHSL data. The high volume and largely non-parametric distribution of satellite imagery allows for a robust application of machine learning techniques. The paper explores unsupervised clusters for exploring and defining urban sprawls. Using an ensemble of various supervised clustering methods, the study aims to employ supervised algorithm in strengthening human activity attribute, by training population based attributes through VIIRS. Unlike DMSP, VIIRS does not suffer with top coding and showcases reasonably well local spatial variance. VIIRS is also relatively free of seasonal biases as the release at a monthly frequency helps in accounting for localized spurts in light intensity caused due to event based external shocks like festivals or calamities. Accurately capturing Urban and Rural regions is critical, particularly from an economic policy perspective.

The computational burden and complexity depends upon the parametric model adopted for the task. Learning based techniques to implement the scheme using low dimensional manifolds offer computationally more efficient alternatives. In this paper we have employed Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Deep Learning (with auto encoders) for manifold learning in the visual domain as well as for the parameters of robotic manipulator for visual servoing. Images of clusters of cylindrical pellets were used as the training data set in the visual domain. Corresponding parameters of the six degrees of freedom robot for picking designated cylindrical pellet formed the training dataset in the robotic configuration space. The correspondence between the weight coefficients of LLE manifold in the visual domain and robotic domain is established through regression. Autoencoders in conjunction with feed forward neural networks were used for learning of correspondence between the high dimensional visual space and low dimensional configuration space. We have compared the results of the two implementations for the same dataset and found that manifold learning using auto encoders resulted in better performance.

Knowledge-based user authentication with the combination of keystroke dynamics as biometric characteristics relates the issues to user authentication/identification in cloud computing based applications. Our approach is the one way, where the performance of the keystroke dynamics biometricin user recognition can be improved by using soft biometric traits that provides some additional information about the user which can be extracted from the typing pattern on a computer keyboard or touch screen phone. These soft biometric traits have low discriminating power but can be used to enhance the performance of user recognition in accuracy and time efficiency. In this paper, we are interested in using this technique in thestatic keystroke dynamics user authentication system. It has been observed that the age group (18?30/30+or < 18/18+), gender (male/female), handedness (left-handed/right-handed), hand(s) used (one hand/both hands), typing skill (touch/others) and emotional states (Anger/Excitation) can be extracted from the way of typing on a computer keyboard for single predefined text.

We propose a sampling strategy to sample the most informative frame which is given for human annotation. This newly annotated frame is used to update the previous annotations.

Our target has been to work around these restrictions to generate a novel approach for creating a balance in taste and flavor while maintaining the nutritional properties within the given upper bound. The resulting product is not only a flavor-wise approximate supplement of the item to be replaced but is also created from ingredients which are derived from the list of food items permitted for consumption by a particular patient suffering from a certain disease. There is a two layer selection procedure which chooses the substitutes from the given list based on the flavor profile of the item whose supplement is to be found, with the cut-off being designed on the basis of the calories, carbohydrates, sugars and fats permitted for the patient being considered to consume.

In training, we use the principle of Bag of Words to extract necessary features to certain domains and objects for classification, similarly, matching them with extracted object blobs that are obtained by subtracting the shadow free background from the foreground.

The original serial version of the ECM is the clustering method which computes online and with a single-pass. The parallel version (Parallel ECM or PECM) is implemented in the Apache Spark framework, which makes it work in real time. The parallelization of the algorithm aims to handle a dataset with large volume. Many of the extant clustering algorithms do not involve a parallel one-pass method. The proposed method addresses this shortcoming. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a credit card fraud dataset (with size 297 MB), and a Higgs dataset was taken from Physics pertaining to particle detectors in the accelerator (with size 1.4 GB). The experimental setup included a cluster of 10 machines having 32 GB RAM each with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Spark computational environment. A remarkable achievement of this research is a dramatic reduction in computational time compared to the serial version of the ECM.

It is very difficult to understand these non-linear and non-stationary electrical flows through naked eye in the time domain. In specific, epilepsy seizures occur irregularly and un-predictively while recording EEG signal. Therefore, it demands a semi-Automatic tool in the framework of machine learning to understand these signals in general and to predict epilepsy seizure in specific. With this motivation, for wide and in-depth understanding of the EEG signal to detect epileptic seizure, this paper focus on the study of EEG signal through machine learning approaches. Neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) basically two fundamental components of machine learning techniques are the primary focus of this paper for classification of EEG signals to label epilepsy patients. The neural networks like multi-layer perceptron, probabilistic neural network, radial basis function neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are taken into consideration for empirical analysis on EEG signal to detect epilepsy seizure. Furthermore, for multi-layer neural networks different propagation training algorithms have been studied such as back-propagation, resilient-propagation, and quick-propagation. For SVM, several kernel methods were studied such as linear, polynomial, and RBF during empirical analysis. Finally, the study confirms with the present setting that, in all cases recurrent neural network performs poorly for the prepared epilepsy data.

Unlike other network security strategies, the act of intrusion detection systems should aware the behavior of the users and signature of the intruded and normal transactions, which is continuous process since the user behavior is not static as well the attack strategies are redefining in magnified speed. Hence, the objective of effective intrusion detection is always a significant factor for research. The bioinspired evolutionary strategies are getting the attention of most of the recent research studies. In order to this, the divergent contexts such as minimal computational complexity, prediction accuracy, ensemble models have been considered as significant objective. The other most significant objective and compatible to current state of art is IDS scalability and robustness in high-speed networks, hence the evolutionary computation approaches are adoptable. In this study, we propose an intrusion detection approach that is based on evolutionary computation technique called Cuckoo search.

This has opened new avenues in influencer marketing. Several portals encourage these marketers to build content for the purpose of digital marketing. However, the content building process produces a lot of spam within these websites when done in bulk. This is often done in order to establish their presence by using techniques including article spinning and keyword stuffing. This study thus attempts to identify these spam websites using a dataset comprising 2751 websites using bio inspired outlier detection approaches. We use publically available key performance indicators (KPIs) through which websites that create spam content to boost the amount of text in the domain are identified. A hybrid wolf search algorithm (WSA) and bat algorithm (BA) integrated with K-means are used to classify these websites into spam. Findings indicate that metrics including Domain Authority, Page Authority, Moz Rank, Links In, External Equity Links, Spam Score, Alexa Rank, Citation Flow, Trust Flow, External Back Links, Referred Domains, SemRush URL Links and SemRush Hostname Links play an important role in identifying spam.

In this work, we have generated classification models by using the inhibition data set of known PTP1B inhibitors to identify new inhibitors of PTP1B utilizing multiple machine learning techniques like naïve Bayesian, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors, along with structural fingerprints and selected molecular descriptors. Several models from each algorithm have been constructed and optimized, with the different combination of molecular descriptors and structural fingerprints. For the training and test sets, most of the predictive models showed more than 90% of overall prediction accuracies. The best model was obtained with support vector machine approach and has Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.82 for the external test set, which was further employed for the virtual screening of Maybridge small compound database. Five compounds were subsequently selected for experimental assay. Out of these two compounds were found to inhibit PTP1B with significant inhibitory activity in in-vitro inhibition assay. The structural fragments which are important for PTP1B inhibition were identified by naïve Bayesian method and can be further exploited to design new molecules around the identified scaffolds. The descriptive and predictive modeling strategy applied in this study is capable of identifying PTP1B inhibitors from the large compound libraries. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; Structure fragments; Support vector machine; Type-2 diabetes; Virtual screening,"Amino acids; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Phosphatases; Proteins; Support vector machines; Classification models; Correlation coefficient; Large compound libraries; Molecular descriptors; Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; Structural fragments; Type-2 diabetes; Virtual Screening; Learning systems; btb 12807; insulin receptor; jfd 02644; jfd 02789; jfd 03705; phosphopeptide; protein tyrosine phosphatase; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor; sb 01794sc; suramin; unclassified drug; insulin; leptin; protein binding; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; PTPN1 protein, human; Article; Bayesian learning; clinical classification; controlled study; correlation coefficient; data base; drug identification; enzyme inhibition; finger dermatoglyphics; human; in vitro study; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; mathematical model; molecular docking; naive bayesian; priority journal; random forest; support vector machine; workflow; antagonists and inhibitors; Bayes theorem; chemistry; drug effects; genetics; machine learning; molecular library; molecular model; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; signal transduction; therapeutic use; Bayes Theorem; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Insulin; Leptin; Machine Learning; Models, Molecular; Obesity; Protein Binding; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1; Signal Transduction; Small Molecule Libraries","Siddiqi, M.I.; Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research InstituteIndia",,Elsevier Inc.,10933263,,JMGMF,28006676,English,J.

The collection of traffic data using multiple sensors and other capture devices have been addressed in multiple researches deploying the mechanism using geodetically static sensor agents. However, the sheath factors for the parallel research outcomes have significantly ignored the fact of data replication control during processing. This work proposes a novel framework for capturing and storing traffic data. During the multi-node traffic data analysis, controlling the replication in order to reduce the cost has also been a challenge. Recent research outcomes demonstrate the use of agent-based sensor networks to accumulate road traffic data. However, a multipurpose framework for accumulating and managing the traffic data is still a demand. The outcomes of this research is also to consider the most effective cloud-based storage for the traffic data with the knowledge of most popular cloud-based storage service providers. The accumulation of the data is also followed by the predictive system for road traffic data analysis.

Here, we seek to propose a general scheme which does not make assumptions regarding the relative position of body parts. Practitioners of Indian classical dances such as Bharatnatyam often enact several dramatic postures called Karanas. However, several challenges such as long flowing dresses of dancers, occlusions, change of camera viewpoint, poor lighting etc. affect the performance of state of- the-art pose estimation algorithms [1, 2] adversely. Body postures enacted by practitioners performing Yoga also violate the assumptions used in current techniques for estimating pose. In this work, we adopt an image recognition approach to tackle this problem. We propose a dataset consisting of 864 images of 12 Karanas captured under controlled laboratory conditions and 1260 real-world images of 14 Karanas obtained from Youtube videos for Bharatnatyam. We also created a new dataset consisting of 400 real-world images of 8 Yoga postures.

Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (OMSA) as a research discipline has emerged during last 15 years and provides a methodology to computationally process the unstructured data mainly to extract opinions and identify their sentiments. The relatively new but fast growing research discipline has changed a lot during these years. This paper presents a scientometric analysis of research work done on OMSA during 2000–2016. For the scientometric mapping, research publications indexed in Web of Science (WoS) database are used as input data. The publication data is analyzed computationally to identify year-wise publication pattern, rate of growth of publications, types of authorship of papers on OMSA, collaboration patterns in publications on OMSA, most productive countries, institutions, journals and authors, citation patterns and an year-wise citation reference network, and theme density plots and keyword bursts in OMSA publications during the period. A somewhat detailed manual analysis of the data is also performed to identify popular approaches (machine learning and lexicon-based) used in these publications, levels (document, sentence or aspect-level) of sentiment analysis work done and major application areas of OMSA.

Realistic and mechanically robust structure for a prosthetic arm was developed in Solid Works. The torque, power requirements and cost estimation were assessed systematically by interfacing the model with SimMechanics software. The robotic arm is equipped with several robot servo motors which perform as links between arms and perform arm movements by interfacing with a robot servo controller and the PIC16F886 microcontroller. The robot servo controller has the capability to drive the servo in controlled position, speed, and acceleration modes. Due to the complexity of the arm kinematics, machine-learning techniques, which rely less on precise mathematical analysis, are implemented. ANFIS is one such machine-learning technique which helps in decision-making and control of robotic arms. This paper implements a MATLAB-derived multilayered ANFIS controller using a PIC16F886 microcontroller as a supervisory control for a 6 DOF robotic arm. This type of robotic arm has many advantages such as simple structure, high flexibility, low energy consumption, quiet operation, and sensory feedback which make it a prosthetic arm with very high resemblance to a normal arm. A good tradeoff between cost and performance is achieved in order to meet the goal of less expensive and useful robotic arm for the disabled.

E-Learning systems currently use string matching or regular expression-based approaches in evaluating short answers. While these endorse the correctness of an answer, they are limited to handling predictable errors only. The nature of errors, however, may vary and it is important to intelligently judge the nature of the error to correctly gauge the state of learning of the learner. A better learning experience requires the system to also display benevolence, which is an innately human behavior characteristic, in evaluating the response. The current paper presents a k-variable fuzzy finite state automaton-based approach to implement an evaluation system for short answers. The proposed method attempts to emulate human behavior in the context of errors committed which may be knowledge based or inadvertent in nature. The technique is explained with sample scores from test conducted on a group of learners. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",E-Learning; Evaluation; Inadvertent error; K-state fuzzy finite automaton; Multiword,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; E-learning; Errors; Information science; Knowledge based systems; Social sciences; Evaluation; Fuzzy finite automata; Fuzzy finite-state automata; Intelligent evaluation; Learning experiences; Multi-word; Regular expressions; String matching; Learning systems,"Chakraborty, U.K.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, SMITIndia; email: udit.kc@gmail.com",Raju K.S.Satapathy S.C.Prasad V.K.Rani B.P.Udgata S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Indian Premier League (IPL), a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in India, has established itself as one of the biggest tournaments in cricket history. In this paper, we propose a model to predict the winner at the end of each over in the second innings of an IPL cricket match. Our methodology not only incorporates the dynamically updating game context as the game progresses, but also includes the relative strength between the two teams playing the match. Estimating the relative strength between two teams involves modeling the individual participating players' potentials. To model a player, we use his career as well as recent performance statistics. Using the various dynamic features, we evaluate several supervised learning algorithms to predict the winner of the match. Finally, using the Random Forest Classifier (RFC), we have achieved an accuracy of 65:79%-84:15% over the course of second innings, with an overall accuracy of 75:68%.",Cricket; Player modeling; Sports analytics; Supervised learning; Winner prediction,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Sports; Supervised learning; Cricket; Dynamic features; Overall accuracies; Player modeling; Random forest classifier; Recent performance; Relative strength; Second innings; Learning algorithms,,Zimmermann A.Kaytoue M.Davis J.,CEUR-WS,16130073,,,,English,CEUR Workshop Proc.,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035014074

Sentimental feedbacks of learners posted at the end of many of these contents may be considered as genuine reactions of the learners who have gone through the contents. Such learners' sentiments are important inputs for judging the acceptability of a learning material. Analyzing such feedbacks using sentiment analysis techniques can identify the best reusable learning contents that may be used for developing new courseware.

However, the task is laborious and demands skill. Associated high cost and low throughput drew considerable interest in automating the testing process. Several neural network architectures were designed to provide human expertise to machines. In this paper, we explore and propose the feasibility of using deep-learning networks for cytopathologic analysis by performing the classification of three important unlabeled, unstained leukemia cell lines (K562, MOLT, and HL60). The cell images used in the classification are captured using a low-cost, high-throughput cell imaging technique: microfluidics-based imaging flow cytometry. We demonstrate that without any conventional fine segmentation followed by explicit feature extraction, the proposed deep-learning algorithms effectively classify the coarsely localized cell lines. We show that the designed deep belief network as well as the deeply pretrained convolutional neural network outperform the conventionally used decision systems and are important in the medical domain, where the availability of labeled data is limited for training.

Head rotation, face pose, illumination variation, occlusion etc. are the attributes that increase the complexity of recognition of spontaneous expressions in practical applications. Effective recognition of expressions depends significantly on the quality of the database used. Most well-known facial expression databases consist of posed expressions. However, currently there is a huge demand for spontaneous expression databases for the pragmatic implementation of the facial expression recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose and establish a new facial expression database containing spontaneous expressions of both male and female participants of Indian origin. The database consists of 428 segmented video clips of the spontaneous facial expressions of 50 participants. In our experiment, emotions were induced among the participants by using emotional videos and simultaneously their self-ratings were collected for each experienced emotion. Facial expression clips were annotated carefully by four trained decoders, which were further validated by the nature of stimuli used and self-report of emotions. An extensive analysis was carried out on the database using several machine learning algorithms and the results are provided for future reference.

Statistical model like integration of auto regressive (AR) and moving average (MA) is capable to handle non-stationary time series but it can deal with only single time series. The machine learning approach [i.e. support vector regression (SVR)] can handle dependency among different time series along with nonlinear separable domains, however it cannot incorporate the past behaviour of time-series. This led us to hybridise auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with SVR model, where focus has been given on minimisation of forecast error using residuals. Issue related to scalability has been handled by taking suitable representative samples from each sub-areas which helped in reducing number of models and drastic reduction in time for tuning different parameters. Results obtained show that the performance of proposed hybrid model is better than individual models.

Manual monitoring of road development is time consuming and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic extraction of roads in vision spectrum (RGB) images acquired by remote sensing from a UAV also known as Low Altitude Remote Sensing (LARS) or Near Earth Remoste Sensing . Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a neural networks based classier is used for spectral classication. Spectral classication is further improved by applying spatial techniques. The spatial techniques include a combination of Shape Index(SI), Density Index(DI) and mathematical morphological close operations. Seven images of diverse road stretches are analyzed to verify the robustness of the proposed method. The classification results are analysed using confusion matrix. The performance parameters derived from confusion matrix are analyzed for a range of hidden neurons of the ELM model and an optimum number of hidden neurons are chosen. Successful road extraction demonstrates the potential of using UAV imagery for monitoring road development. © 2017 ACRS.

The fourth level (LL4) low frequency sub-band coefficients are used for embedding the watermark. The machine is tuned iteratively and used for training and predicting the sub-band coefficients. The target fourth level sub-band coefficients are augmented by the quantized fourth level sub-band coefficients which are set as an input data-set to train the machine. A random key determines the starting position of the coefficients where the watermark is embedded. A binary watermark is embedded in the blue channel of four colored host images. This watermarking scheme strengthen the robustness towards popular interferences on images. The results of simulation clearly proves that the recovered watermark from signed and attacked images are similar to the embedded watermark. The time spans for training, embedding and extraction are computed and they show real time behavior (millisecond time spans) so that the proposed scheme is suitable for developing real time watermarking applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Watermarking; Binary watermarks; Blue channels; Color image watermarking; Embedded watermarks; Extreme learning machine; Real time behavior; Real-time watermarking; Watermarking schemes; Image watermarking,"Rajpal, A.; Department of Computer Science, University of DelhiIndia; email: ankit.cs.du@gmail.com",Murgante B.Apduhan B.O.Borruso G.Cuzzocrea A.Torre C.M.Gervasi O.Taniar D.Stankova E.Rocha A.M.A.C.Misra S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Chatter occurs as a dynamic interaction between the tool and the work piece resulting in poor surface finish, high-pitch noise and premature tool failure. In this paper, the chatter prediction is done by active method by considering the parameters like spindle speed, depth of cut, feed rate and including the dynamics of both the tool and the workpiece. The vibration signals are acquired using an accelerometer in a closed environment. From the acquired signals discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), features are extracted and classified into three different patterns (stable, transition and chatter) using support vector machine (SVM). The classified results are validated using surface roughness values (Ra).

The problem finds numerous applications in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing settings where only partial or distant supervision is available. We present a novel method for optimizing multivariate performance measures in the MIML setting. Our approach MIMLperf uses a novel plug-in technique and offers a seamless way to optimize a vast variety of performance measures such as macro and micro-F measure, average precision, which are performance measures of choice in multi-label learning domains. MIMLperf offers two key benefits over the state of the art. Firstly, across a diverse range of benchmark tasks, ranging from relation extraction to text categorization and scene classification, MIMLperf offers superior performance as compared to state of the art methods designed specifically for these tasks. Secondly, MIMLperf operates with significantly reduced running times as compared to other methods, often by an order of magnitude or more. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Existing sound source localization methods are either based on an approximate physical model (physics-driven) or on a specific-purpose calibration set (data-driven). With VAST, the idea is to learn a mapping from audio features to desired audio properties using a massive dataset of simulated room impulse responses. This virtual dataset is designed to be maximally representative of the potential audio scenes that the considered system may be evolving in, while remaining reasonably compact. We show that virtuallylearned mappings on this dataset generalize to real data, overcoming some intrinsic limitations of traditional binaural sound localization methods based on time differences of arrival. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Binaural hearing; Machine learning; Room simulation; Sound localization,Acoustic generators; Audition; Bins; Learning systems; Mapping; Program processors; Binaural hearing; Binaural sound localizations; Room impulse response; Room simulation; Sound localization; Sound source localization; Time-differences; Virtual acoustic space; Acoustics,"Gaultier, C.; Inria Rennes - Bretagne AtlantiqueFrance; email: clement.gaultier@inria.fr",Tichavsky P.Babaie-Zadeh M.Michel O.J.J.Thirion-Moreau N.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Popularity of social network provides a statistical way to predict the upcoming and outgoing fashion trends through social content data analysis. Social image data is a most expressive form of content data which is useful to get the fashion related information. But, characteristics of social data such as heterogeneity, large volume, etc. make this problem challenging. Hence, in this paper semi-supervised feature extraction and classification model is proposed based on the joint probability of multiple features. We conducted experiments on Fashion 10000 dataset [1] having images from Flickr. First, feature extraction is done where Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based matching points (using labelled and unlabelled images) along with five other features i.e. color, texture, regional, geometric and face detection (using unlabelled image) are obtained. Due to the consideration of multiple significant features, proposed approach is able to deal with the heterogeneity in given images. Linear convolution is performed to get the representative image with prominent features and it is compared with labelled representative images of each class to get the number of matching points for that class. Color and texture features are extracted with the help of RGB components and gray level co-occurrence matrix, respectively. Values of extent, eccentricity and orientation are considered as regional features and Euler number as geometric feature. As most of the social images with person consist fashion related information, face detection is also carried out to show the presence of person in given image and stored it as a feature. Then, class-conditional probabilities of all the extracted features are computed and the maximum joint probability is used while assigning the class label to the given image. Obtained results show that incorporation of matching points using CNN with other features, improves the accuracy than using only other five features. In [2], search based classification using twelve global features is carried out by B. Loni et al. on same fashion dataset where 0.7421 f1-score for visual only method is obtained. Using only six features, approximately similar results are achieved with our proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Classification; Fashion images; Feature extraction; Social data,Color matching; Convolution; Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Learning systems; Neural networks; Probability; Textile industry; Color and texture features; Conditional probabilities; Convolutional neural network; Fashion images; Feature extraction and classification; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Linear convolution; Social datum; Classification (of information),"Wazarkar, S.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: wazarkarseema@nitgoa.ac.in",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Tenant Virtual Machine (VM) level security solutions can be easily evaded by modern attack techniques. Out-VM monitoring allows cloud administrator (CA) to monitor and control a VM from a secure location outside the VM. In this paper, we propose an out-VM monitoring based approach named as 'Program Semantic-Aware Intrusion Detection at Network and Hypervisor Layer' (PSI-NetVisor) to detect attacks in both network and virtualization layer in cloud. PSI-NetVisor performs network monitoring by employing behavior based intrusion detection approach (BIDA) at the network layer of centralized Cloud Network Server (CNS); providing the first level of defense from attacks. It incorporates semantic awareness in the intrusion detection approach and enables it to provide network monitoring and process monitoring at the hypervisor layer of Cloud Compute Server (CCoS); providing the second level of defense from attacks. PSI-NetVisor employs Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) libraries based on software break point injection to extract process execution traces from hypervisor. It further applies depth first search (DFS) to construct program semantics from control flow graph of execution traces. It applies dynamic analysis and machine learning approaches to learn the behavior of anomalies which makes it secure from obfuscation and encryption based attacks. PSI-NetVisor has been validated with latest intrusion datasets (UNSW-NB & Evasive Malware) collected from research centers and results seem to be promising. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Due to the variety of ACs types and the different sizes of residences, modelling the power consumption of AC load individually is non-Trivial. Here, an adaptive framework based on Regression Trees is proposed to model and forecast the power consumption of different AC units in different environments by taking in just 6 basic variables. The framework consists of an automatic feature selection process, a load prediction module, an indoor temperature forecasting module, and is capped off by a load forecasting module. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using data set from an ongoing research project on air-conditioning system control for energy management in a residential test bed in Singapore. Experiments on highly dynamic loads gave a maximum Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 21.35% for 30min ahead forecasting and 27.96% for day ahead forecasting. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Like our previous work on the LRB branching heuristic, we once again view these heuristics as techniques to solve the learning rate optimization problem. First, we show that there is a strong positive correlation between GLR and solver efficiency for a variety of branching heuristics. Second, we test our hypothesis further by developing a new branching heuristic that maximizes GLR greedily. We show empirically that this heuristic achieves very high GLR and interestingly very low literal block distance (LBD) over the learnt clauses. In our experiments this greedy branching heuristic enables the solver to solve instances faster than VSIDS, when the branching time is taken out of the equation. This experiment is a good proof of concept that a branching heuristic maximizing GLR will lead to good solver performance modulo the computational overhead. Third, we propose that machine learning algorithms are a good way to cheaply approximate the greedy GLR maximization heuristic as already witnessed by LRB. In addition, we design a new branching heuristic, called SGDB, that uses a stochastic gradient descent online learning method to dynamically order branching variables in order to maximize GLR. We show experimentally that SGDB performs on par with the VSIDS branching heuristic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Computation theory; Formal logic; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Branching heuristics; Computational overheads; Empirical studies; On-line learning methods; Positive correlations; Solver performance; Stochastic gradient descent; Through the lens; Heuristic methods,"Liang, J.H.; University of WaterlooCanada; email: jliang@gsd.uwaterloo.ca",Gaspers S.Walsh T.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Hyperspectral imaging is an emerging imaging modality for medical applications, especially in disease diagnosis and image-guided surgery. HSI acquires a three-dimensional dataset called hypercube, with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension. Spatially resolved spectral imaging obtained by HSI provides diagnostic information about the objects physiology, morphology, and composition. The present work involves testing and evaluating the performance of the hyperspectral imaging system. The methodology involved manually taking reflectance of the object in many images or scan of the object. The object used for the evaluation of the system was cabbage and tomato. The data is further converted to the required format and the analysis is done using machine learning algorithm. The machine learning algorithms applied were able to distinguish between the object present in the hypercube obtain by the scan. It was concluded from the results that system was working as expected.

Data is vulnerable to various types of intrusion attacks that may reduce the utility of any network or systems. Constantly changing and the complicated nature of intrusion activities on computer networks cannot be dealt with IDSs that are currently operational. Identifying and preventing such attacks is one of the most challenging tasks. Deep Learning is one of the most effective machine learning techniques which is getting popular recently.

Such applications demand prediction models with small storage and computational complexity that do not compromise significantly on accuracy. In this work, we propose ProtoNN, a novel algorithm that addresses the problem of real-time and accurate prediction on resource-scarce devices. ProtoNN is inspired by k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) but has several orders lower storage and prediction complexity. ProtoNN models can be deployed even on devices with puny storage and computational power (e.g. An Arduino UNO with 2kB RAM) to get excellent prediction accuracy. ProtoNN derives its strength from three key ideas: a) learning a small number of prototypes to represent the entire training set, b) sparse low dimensional projection of data, c) joint discriminative learning of the projection and prototypes with explicit model size constraint. Wc conduct systematic empirical evaluation of ProtoNN on a variety of supervised learning tasks (binary, multi-class, multi-label classification) and show that it gives nearly state-of-the-art prediction ac-curacy on resource-scarce devices while consuming several orders lower storage, and using minimal working memory.

The energy generated by photovoltaic systems is a function of the received solar irradiance which varies due to atmospheric and weather conditions. A key component required for forecasting irradiance accurately is the clear sky model which estimates the average irradiance at a location at a given time in the absence of clouds. Current methods for modelling clear sky irradiance are either inaccurate or require extensive atmospheric data, which tends to vary with location and is often unavailable. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology, Blue Skies, for modelling clear sky irradiance solely based on historical irradiance measurements.

B2B setup is different from B2C setup in many ways. Along with the contrasting buying entity (company vs. individual), there are dissimilarities in order size (few dollars in e-commerce vs. up to several thousands of dollars in B2B), buying cycle (few days in B2C vs. 6–18 months in B2B) and most importantly a presence of multiple decision makers (individual or family vs. an entire company). Due to easy availability of the data and bargained complexities, most of the existing literature has been set in the B2C framework and there are not many examples in the B2B context. We present a unique approach to model next likely action of B2B customers by observing a sequence of digital actions. In this paper, we propose a unique two-step approach to model next likely action using a novel ensemble method that aims to predict the best digital asset to target customers as a next action. The paper provides a unique approach to translate the propensity model at an email address level into a segment that can target a group of email addresses. In the first step, we identify the high propensity customers for a given asset using traditional and advanced multinomial classification techniques and use non-negative least squares to stack rank different assets based on the output for ensemble model. In the second step, we perform a penalized regression to reduce the number of coefficients and obtain the satisfactory segment variables. Using real world digital marketing campaign data, we further show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional classification methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",B2B; Digital; Ensemble; Literature survey; Multi-class classification; Next-best action; Non-negativity constraint; Regression; Robustness,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data mining; Education; Electronic commerce; Electronic mail; Learning systems; Marketing; Robustness (control systems); Sales; Digital; Ensemble; Literature survey; Multi-class classification; Next-best action; Non-negativity constraints; Regression; Pattern recognition,"Bhandari, A.; VMware Inc.United States; email: anitb@vmware.com",Perner P.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Alternatively, the utility of integrating decision maker’s (DM’s) preferences into the optimization process so as to target some most preferred solutions by the DM (instead of the whole Paretooptimal front), is also being increasingly recognized. The authors here, have earlier argued that despite the promises in the latter approach, its practical utility may be impaired by the lack of—objectivity, repeatability, consistency, and coherence in the DM’s preferences. To counter this, the authors have also earlier proposed a machine learning based decision support framework to reveal the preference-structure of objectives. Notably, the revealed preference-structure may be sensitive to the timing of application of this framework along an MOEA run. In this paper the authors counter this limitation, by integrating a termination criterion with an MOEA run, towards determining the appropriate timing for application of the machine learning based framework. Results based on three real-world many-objective problems considered in this paper, highlight the utility of the proposed integration towards an objective, repeatable, consistent, and coherent decision support for many-objective problems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Timing circuits; Decision support framework; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Pareto-optimal front; Preference structures; Preferred solutions; Revealed preference; Termination criteria; Decision support systems,"Duro, J.A.; Automatic Control and Systems Engineering Department, The University of SheffieldUnited Kingdom; email: j.a.duro@sheffield.ac.uk",Schutze O.Rudolph G.Klamroth K.Jin Y.Trautmann H.Grimme C.Wiecek M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Our key insight is that 3D shapes are effectively characterized by their hierarchical organization of parts, which reflects fundamental intra-shape relationships such as adjacency and symmetry. We develop a recursive neural net (RvNN) based autoencoder to map a flat, unlabeled, arbitrary part layout to a compact code. The code effectively captures hierarchical structures of man-made 3D objects of varying structural complexities despite being fixed-dimensional: an associated decoder maps a code back to a full hierarchy. The learned bidirectional mapping is further tuned using an adversarial setup to yield a generative model of plausible structures, from which novel structures can be sampled. Finally, our structure synthesis framework is augmented by a second trained module that produces fine-grained part geometry, conditioned on global and local structural context, leading to a full generative pipeline for 3D shapes. We demonstrate that without supervision, our network learns meaningful structural hierarchies adhering to perceptual grouping principles, produces compact codes which enable applications such as shape classification and partial matching, and supports shape synthesis and interpolation with significant variations in topology and geometry. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Analysis and synthesis of shape structures; Autoencoder; Generative adversarial training; Generative recursive autoencoder; Recursive neural network; Symmetry hierarchy,Codes (symbols); Interactive computer graphics; Network architecture; Neural networks; Analysis and synthesis; Auto encoders; Hierarchical organizations; Hierarchical structures; Recursive neural networks; Structural complexity; Structural hierarchies; Symmetry hierarchies; Learning systems,"Xu, K.; National University of Defense TechnologyChina; email: kevin.kai.xu@gmail.com",,Association for Computing Machinery,7300301,,ATGRD,,English,ACM Trans Graphics,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030755809

Most systems doing so apply document similarity computation methods to all pairs of provided job descriptions. This approach can be computationally expensive and adversely impacted by the quality of the job descriptions which often include information not relevant to the job or candidate qualifications. We propose a method to narrow down pairs of job descriptions to be compared by comparing job titles first. The observation that each job title can be decomposed into three components, domain, function and attribute, forms the basis of our method. Our proposal focuses on training the machine learning models to identify these three components of any given job title. Next we do a semantic match between the three identified components, and use those match scores to create a composite similarity score between any two pair of job titles. The elegance of this solution lies in the fact that job titles are the most concise definition of the job and the resulting matches can easily be verified by human experts.

Moreover, the daily life information on social networking sites is changing energetically over web. Teenagers and university students are the major users for the different social networks all over the world. In order to maintain rapid user satisfactions, information ow and clustering are essential. However, these tasks are very challenging due to the excessive datasets. In this context, cleaning the original data is significant. Thus, in the current work the Fishers Discrimination Criterion (FDC) is applied to clean the raw datasets. The FDC separates the datasets for superior fit under least square sense. It arranges datasets by combining linearly with greater ratios of between - groups and within the groups. In the proposed approach, the separated data are handled by the Bigtable mapping that is constructed with Map specification, tabular representation and aggregation. The first phase organizes the cleaned datasets in row, column and timestamps. In the tabular representation, Sorted String Table (SSTable) ensures the exact mapping. Aggregation phase is employed to find out the similarity among the extracted datasets. Mapping, preprocessing and aggregation help to monitor information ow and communication over Facebook. For smooth and continuous monitoring, the Dynamic Source Monitoring (DSM) scheme is applied. Adequate experimental comparisons and synthesis are performed with mapping the Facebook datasets. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed machine learning approaches for the Facebook datasets monitoring. © 2017 CTU FTS.",Aggregation; Bigtable; Dynamic source monitoring; Fisher discriminant criterion; Sorted string table,Agglomeration; Automation; Electric network topology; Learning systems; Mapping; Social networking (online); Bigtable; Discrimination criteria; Experimental comparison; Fisher discriminant criterion; Machine learning approaches; Social networking sites; Sorted string table; Tabular representations; Monitoring,"Kamal, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, East West UniversityBangladesh; email: sarwar.saubdcoxbazar@gmail.com",,Institute of Computer Science,12100552,,NNWOF,,English,Neural Network World,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020201013

The proposed framework has: (1) a deep architecture which enables us to infer multiple layers of latent features/communities for each node, providing superior link prediction performance on more complex networks and better interpretability of the latent features; and (2) a regression model which allows directly conditioning the node latent features on the side information available in form of node attributes. Our framework handles both (1) and (2) via a clean, unified model, which enjoys full local conjugacy via data augmentation, and facilitates efficient inference via closed form Gibbs sampling. Moreover, inference cost scales in the number of edges which is attractive for massive but sparse networks. Our framework is also easily extendable to model weighted networks with count-valued edges.

We distill some properties of activation functions that lead to local strong convexity in the neighborhood of the ground-truth parameters for the INN squared-loss objective and most popular nonlinear activation functions satisfy the distilled properties, including rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs, squared ReLUs and sigmoids. For activation functions that are also smooth, we show local linear convergence guarantees of gradient descent under a resampling rule. For homogeneous activations, we show tensor methods are able to initialize the parameters to fall into the local strong convexity region. As a result, tensor initialization followed by gradient descent is guaranteed to recover the ground truth with sample complexity d log(l/?) poly(?, ?) and computational complexity n d poly(?, ?) for smooth homogeneous activations with high probability, where d is the dimension of the input, ? (? ? d) is the number of hidden nodes, ? is a conditioning property of the ground-truth parameter matrix between the input layer and the hidden layer, e is the targeted precision and n is the number of samples.

The uncertainty definition leads to an improved and effective product style retrieval when combined with fuzzy sets. First, a style knowledge and features database are constructed using fuzzy case-based reasoning technology; a similarity measurement method based on case-based reasoning and fuzzy model of the fuzzy proximity method may be defined by the fuzzy nearest-neighbor algorithm for obtaining the style knowledge extraction. Second, the linguistic variables (LV) are used to assess the product characteristics to establish the product style evaluation database for simplifying the style presentation and decreasing the computational complexity. Third, the model of product style feature set, extracted by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), and the final style related form features set are acquired using LV. This research involves a case study for extracting the key form features of the style of high heel shoes. The proposed algorithms are generated by calculating the weights of each component of high heel shoes using FAHP with LV.

Moreover the number of clusters K must be known in advance. The recently introduced sum-of-norms (SON) or Clusterpath convex relaxation of k-means and hierarchical clustering shrinks cluster centroids toward one another and ensure a unique global minimizer. We give a scalable stochastic incremental algorithm based on proximal iterations to solve the SON problem with convergence guarantees. We also show that the algorithm recovers clusters under quite general conditions which have a similar form to the unifying proximity condition introduced in the approximation algorithms community (that covers paradigm cases such as Gaussian mixtures and planted partition models).

In this paper, we study the problem of image tag complete and proposed a novel method for this problem based on a popular image representation method, convolutional neural network (CNN). The method estimates the complete tags from the convolutional filtering outputs of images based on a linear predictor. The CNN parameters, linear predictor, and the complete tags are learned jointly by our method. We build a minimization problem to encourage the consistency between the complete tags and the available incomplete tags, reduce the estimation error, and reduce the model complexity.

In previous studies, this stratification has been mainly based on analysis of the far wall of the carotid artery. Due to the multifocal nature of atherosclerotic disease, the plaque growth is not restricted to the far wall alone. This paper presents a new approach for stroke risk assessment by integrating assessment of both the near and far walls of the carotid artery using grayscale morphology of the plaque. Further, this paper presents a scientific validation system for stroke risk assessment. Both these innovations have never been presented before. The methodology consists of an automated segmentation system of the near wall and far wall regions in grayscale carotid B-mode ultrasound scans. Sixteen grayscale texture features are computed, and fed into the machine learning system. The training system utilizes the lumen diameter to create ground truth labels for the stratification of stroke risk. The cross-validation procedure is adapted in order to obtain the machine learning testing classification accuracy through the use of three sets of partition protocols: (5, 10, and Jack Knife). The mean classification accuracy over all the sets of partition protocols for the automated system in the far and near walls is 95.08% and 93.47%, respectively. The corresponding accuracies for the manual system are 94.06% and 92.02%, respectively. The precision of merit of the automated machine learning system when compared against manual risk assessment system are 98.05% and 97.53% for the far and near walls, respectively. The ROC of the risk assessment system for the far and near walls is close to 1.0 demonstrating high accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Carotid wall; Far; Machine learning; Near; Precision of merit; ROC; Segmentation; Stroke; Ultrasound,"Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Morphology; Ultrasonics; Automated segmentation; Carotid wall; Classification accuracy; Grayscale morphology; Near; Precision of merit; Risk stratification; Stroke; Risk assessment; adult; aged; arterial wall thickness; Article; atherosclerotic plaque; automation; carotid artery; cerebrovascular accident; clinical assessment; clinical feature; clinical protocol; controlled study; coronary risk; echography; female; high risk patient; human; low risk patient; machine learning; major clinical study; male; priority journal; real time ultrasound scanner; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; tissue characterization; validation process; carotid artery; carotid artery disease; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; echography; image processing; machine learning; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; risk assessment; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Stroke; Ultrasonography","Suri, J.S.United States; email: Jasjit.Suri@atheropoint.com",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,27915126,English,Comput.
