The cooperation in CUs for SM is an effective solution to improve its performance.Therefore, in this paper, a scenario, where CUs can cooperate with each other for SM is presented and have analyzed the effect of cooperation on various performance metrics namely, the data-loss, interference efficiency, and energy efficiency. An algorithm is illustrated for the computation of data-loss under various conditions of the traffic intensity of PU and probability of SM error. Moreover, the closed-form expressions of these metrics are derived for the cooperative and non-cooperative SM. Further, the simulation results are presented for various scenarios of traffic intensity, probability of SM error and channel gain between the CUs’ transmitter to PU receiver. Furthermore, the Monte-Carlo simulation results are exploited to consider the random nature of the PUs’ traffic intensity as well as to support the numerically simulated results. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Cognitive radio; Data loss; Energy efficiency; Interference efficiency; Spectrum monitoring; Throughput","Energy efficiency; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Throughput; Closed-form expression; Cognitive radio network; Data loss; Effective solution; Performance analysis; Performance metrics; Spectrum monitoring; Traffic intensity; Cognitive radio","Singh, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information TechnologyIndia; email: ghanshyam.singh@juit.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039066195

For this, LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) technology is standardized in 3GPP Release 12. The use of coexistence mechanism such as Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) can help protecting the quality of service of mobile users operating in the WiFi band by guaranteeing them channel access. Additionally, allocation of wireless resources to each mobile user in the WiFi band should be controlled to facilitate interference-free transmissions to other mobile users in the same band. In this paper, we propose two resource allocation techniques for femtocell networks which efficiently allocate resources such as spectrum and transmit power among competing mobile users in the LTE and WiFi bands. For the LTE band, we propose the use of spreading based spectrum and power allocation, and model the throughput of femtocells using a non-cooperative game theoretic framework. To improve the co-existence performance of femtocells operating in the WiFi band, we propose a Q-leaning based resource allocation technique for femtocell transmit power and duty cycle calculation. In a scenario where multiple base stations are available for user-base station association, considering only the signal strength to make association decision is not an optimal approach, specially when user load and available resources at base stations vary significantly with time. Considering this, we suggest a cell selection scheme that assigns mobile users to femtocells considering the bitrate they are expected to receive in both LTE and WiFi bands. Our resource allocation techniques, when combined with the proposed cell selection scheme, show a minimum improvement of 23.4% in network throughput and 19.6% reduction in energy consumption. This, in turn, also improves the energy efficiency of the network by at least 35%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cell selection; Energy efficiency; LTE-U femtocell network; Spectrum and power allocation; Spreading","Base stations; Cells; Cytology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Femtocell; Game theory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Cell selection; Duty-cycle calculations; Femtocell Networks; Noncooperative game; Optimal approaches; Power allocations; Resource allocation techniques; Spreading; Wireless telecommunication systems","Thakur, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, 600036, India; email: rahult@cse.iitm.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

In this paper we focus on designing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based system, which can efficiently conserve the energy of class rooms and labs. We have identified temperature, light, pressure sensors to be utilized for this application. Infra Red receiver and transmitter is used to detect an event whether a person is leaving the room or not. Server room is checked for humidity, temperature, smoke by an integrated sensor, which sends the sensed data to the cloud. So all the sensors send the data periodically to the cloud, which processes the collected data and send the triggered response to the necessary output device and message the facility manager to take administrative actions. The status of each room in each floor is ultimately received at the central monitoring station at the ground floor of the building. The proposed system is designed in such a manner, it can be replicated cost-efficiently in multiple buildings within a campus by using low cost sensors and with the existing communication devices. Therefore this Green Campus System (GCS) design based on wireless sensor networks help in meeting the target of sustainable cities by reducing the overall energy consumption and improving the efficiency in the energy resource management. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy conservation in buildings; Wireless sensor network","Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Floors; Historic preservation; Administrative action; Carbon foot prints; Central monitoring stations; Communication device; Educational institutions; Energy resource managements; In-buildings; Sustainable cities; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509060467,,,"English","GHTC - IEEE Glob.

Various edge detection techniques are obtained like Sobel, PSO Preweitt, Laplacian and Laplacian of Gaussian. These techniques consume some restrictions such as fixed edge thickness and some parameter like threshold is problematic to implement. Although many different edge-detection methods have been proposed for gray-scale, color, and multispectral images, they still face difficulties when extracting edge features from hyperspectral images (HSIs) that contain a large number of bands with very narrow gap in the spectral domain. High performance computing (HPC) is a technique used to assemble process and analyze more quantity of remote sensing (satellite) data which needs less processing time. HPC method is used in distributed & cluster Computing, parallel computing and following satellite data analyzing & processing approaches like geo-referencing, image edge detection, image classification, image mosaicking, Morphological/neural approach and image fusion for hyperspectral satellite data. Stimulated by means of the specific clustering of theory called gravitational theory, an original edge detection process. The conservative methods include the usage of linear time invariant filters. Recognition of edge is done by these filters as a These filters recognize an edge as a sudden conversion of grey scale pixel intensity. These techniques are well recognized and computationally effective. Canny, Sobel, Robert, Kirsch, Prewitt and LOG, on idea of spatial differential filters by using local grade. Within the less time these filters process the data and are inclined to noise. But in fuzzy technique, it does not include like this restriction, by altering the rules and output parameters, it is possible to change the thickness of the edge. In this paper, a new technique is created on fuzzy logic, which is suggested for detection of edge in digital images deprived of finding the threshold value. This method starts through segmenting the images into sections by means of fluctuating 3 (Formula presented.) 3 binary matrixes. The pixels of edge are planned to a range of standards separated from each other. The results of this proposed technique is compared with the results obtained from PSO and neural network methods. This suggested technique provides a permanent effect in the lines smoothness and straightness for the straight lines and good roundness for the curved lines.

To amend service throughput, most of the services running on these devices are expected to be in listening mode (radio 'ON') always. This results in larger energy consumption and directly effects battery life of constrained devices. Evolution of IoT brings multifold increase in number of services provided by devices, consequently causing drastic traffic load at the access router, forcing congestion indispensable. Thus, devices are forced to do multiple re-transmissions (i.e., more usage of energy) before declaring packet delivery as success or failure. This effects life of battery powered devices severely. Through this paper we are proposing a new communication methodology to save /extend battery life of constrained devices by facilitating them to sleep for longer time. Efforts are made to define an efficient sleep mechanism by effective and efficient estimation of network traffic. This paper includes a novel method to avoid re-transmission by constrained devices during added traffic, and also comprises of a new method for maintaining sleepy devices' presence for other IoT devices. � 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Constrained devices; Deep Sleep; Energy saving; IoT; Retransmission; Smart building; Smart home","Automation; Big data; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heterogeneous networks; Intelligent buildings; Machinery; Sleep research; Traffic congestion; Battery powered devices; Communication methodology; Computing machinery; Constrained devices; Deep Sleep; Efficient estimation; Retransmissions; Smart homes; Internet of things",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450354301,,,"English","ACM Int.

Commercial grid offers their services (resources) on use-and-pay basis. Resource management in computational grid, offers a market place for the two prominent grid market players i.e. resource provider and resource consumer. It has been observed that, in the grid, the request for the resources may not be uniform throughout. It fluctuates from very high demand at peak time to low or negligible at off-peak time. This information may be used to fetch the resource utilization and cost benefits out of the grid. The provider would prefer to charge extra for its resources at peak time, whereas users may shift their resources usage preference to off-peak time. This work proposes a model in which the resource provider and consumer play a non-cooperative game at different time-zones and act independently to choose their actions. Some characteristic parameters such as cost, execution time and reliability have been considered to facilitate the job execution. Based on the outcome of the game, the grid cluster offering maximum reliability within the desired execution time and/or cost for the job execution.

The network is partitioned into a virtual equal-sized grids. The proposed protocol, Mode-Switched Grid-based Routing (MSGR) for Wireless Sensor Networks selects one node per grid as the Grid Head. The routing path to the sink is established using Grid Heads. Grid Heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternatively. So, not all Grid Heads take part in the routing process at a time. This saves energy of Grid Heads and improves the network lifetime. The proposed method builds a routing path using each active Grid Head leading towards the sink. The routing path changes only for some Grid Head nodes whenever the mobile sink moves to a different grid.

As there is absence of complete path from source to destination in the network, these networks are often susceptible to high delays. In DTNs, one of the primary objective is to establish end-to-end communication path between the nodes in the heterogeneous environment e Factors such as discharge of batteries and link failure lead to frequent disconnection in these networks. The amount of energy dissipated in the network is highly dependent on the message routing and node mobility. Therefore, developing an energy efficient routing protocol is a key issue in DTNs. A plethora of routing algorithms for DTNs is developed, but only few of them take energy constraint into consideration. The challenge to maintain the high reliability of network in the presence of frequent topology changes in DTNs has garnered immense interest from the researchers to further explore the area.

The solution to this problem is to automate the deployment and configuration using templates. These templates allow the users to specify the information about resource requirements of an application. In this paper, firstly, we present the methods for development of complex templates that consist of various properties like input parameters and conditional logic, lacking in existing simple templates. OpenStack is the popularly used private Cloud deployment tool and many other similar tools lack in providing the complex templates in their architecture. The complex templates proposed in this paper are generic in nature and designed keeping OpenStack in mind. Using the proposed complex templates, based on user defined input values and conditional logic, various infrastructure stacks can be created in simple templates and can be directly fed into heat engine for deployment. The complex templates can be developed to accept input parameters, including conditional logic or auto scaling constructs. Though the complex template allows us to specify the requirement in an easy way but it is difficult and sometimes inaccurate, to visualize the outcome. Under such circumstances estimating the billing cost of the infrastructure stack is extremely difficult. In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper secondly, we propose a system that can automate the cost estimation of a stack before its creation. In order to assess the cost estimates, we have implemented machine learning using decision trees on the templates data that can produce the output in the form of two classes and give the decision that whether it is good to deploy templates or not. The preliminary assessment is done on the proposed model and results achieved are produced. © 2017 IEEE.","cloud; Complex Templates; Constructs; HOT; OpenStack; Orchestration; Template","Application programs; Clouds; Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Decision trees; Learning systems; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Trees (mathematics); Complex Templates; Constructs; Openstack; Orchestration; Template; Computer circuits",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

CR-MAC reduces E2ETD by optimizing the time interval between the successively sent data packets of a node in a scheduled flow and using a small size control packet to send the request for data transmission.

In additions, sensors in such environment are energy constrained and generate the huge amount of data due to redundant data transmission and thus reducing lifetime of networks. Moreover, there is need to use efficient clustering techniques for collecting relevant data from nodes to eliminate redundancy. The data gathering using existing clustering algorithms engage some problems like arbitrary shape of clusters, estimating input parameters, detection of noisy points. In this paper, we propose an improved clustering method known as hybrid DB-EMGM that combines both EMGM and DBSCAN methods. The improved method aims to reduce the data traffic inside the WSNs network by minimizing intra cluster distance and, thus, finding location of cluster heads using calculated cluster covariance and mean when forming different clusters. The concept of mobile sink node is utilized for collecting the relevant data from all nodes by visiting every cluster heads. Since the mobility concept of node tries to reduce wireless data transmission by following the shortest path based on cluster heads location. The results of our method show that it is computationally faster than EMGM by reducing intra and inter cluster communication distance and increases the transmission rate to the sink node. The performance of our improved method is validated through results presented. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; clustering etc; DB-EMGM; DBSCAN; EMGM; Energy Efficient","Big data; Cluster analysis; Data acquisition; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes; clustering etc; DB-EMGM; DBSCAN; EMGM; Energy efficient; Clustering algorithms",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In a given sensing field, sensor nodes can often be grouped into non overlapping subsets called clusters. Gaussian distribution is preferably used for realistic applications and can provide a reduction in energy hole problem and enhance intrusion detection capability. In this research paper, we proposed the cluster size optimization for the Gaussian distributed sensor nodes, while, Base Station (BS) follows a Tunable Multilevel Sensing Model (TMSM). Using this model, we obtained an expression to find optimal clusters. Herein, the communication between Cluster Heads (CH) and Base Station (BS) is considered to be of single-hop mode. Subsequently, it has illustrated the effectiveness of proposed model in comparison with two contemporary models (a) Gaussian distribution of sensor nodes, where a BS follows a simple (classical) sensing model (GSS) (b) Uniform distribution of sensor nodes, where a BS follows the simple (classical) sensing model (USS).

If some or all neighboring pixels form a convex region of same gray level intensity, then there exists an edge. In order to distinguish between different level of intensities in edge detection, a threshold is required which is usually different for different type of images due to variation in level of intensities. This paper proposes and compares two methods namely global and local thresholding to model the value of threshold through quantitative empirical method for cellular logic array processing based edge detection method. The performance of the modeled algorithms is measured by F1-score, recall-precision break-even-points and performance ratio. Experimental results show that the local thresholding approach gives slightly better F1-score and performance ratio for all scenarios of six Berkeley Segmentation Database images and respective ground truths. It has also been found that best percentage of threshold value can be determined in a better way by break-even-point rather than by best F1-score. The proposed approach reduces false edge detection and make threshold selection automatic for every scenario. © 2017 IEEE.","Cellular Logic Array processing; Edge Detection; Threshold modeling","Array processing; Cellular arrays; Computation theory; Edge detection; Image segmentation; Signal detection; Berkeley Segmentation Database; Edge detection algorithms; Edge detection methods; Gray level intensity; Image processing functions; Local thresholding; Threshold model; Threshold selection; Computer circuits",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

It is considered as efficient routing for large scale networks and offers encouraging solutions for information dissemination in Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs). The efficacy and scalability of all the geographic routing depends on the accuracy of location information obtained from positioning systems. Related literature implicitly assumed perfect location information. However, such belief is unrealistic in the real world. Measured location information inherently has inaccuracy, leading to performance degradation of geographic routing. In this paper, a novel location error tolerant geographical routing (LETGR) in vehicular environment is proposed that can reduce the impact of location inaccuracy in measurement due to instrument imprecision and obstacles in the realistic scenarios in highly mobile environment. LETGR takes the statistical error characteristic into account in its next forwarding vehicle selection logic to maximize the probability of message delivery. To alleviate the effect of mobility, LETGR exploits future locations of vehicles instead of current locations. Extended Kalman filter is used in the proposed algorithm for predicting and correcting future locations of the vehicles. Performance of the LETGR algorithm is evaluated via simulation and results show that LETGR algorithm performance is encouraging when the objective is to maximize the reception of data packets at the destination vehicle. © 2017 IEEE.","Extended Kalman filter; Future location prediction; Geographical Routing; Location error; Vehicular ad-hoc networks","Computation theory; Errors; Extended Kalman filters; Global positioning system; Information dissemination; Location; Network routing; Vehicles; Algorithm performance; Geographical routing; Location errors; Location prediction; Performance degradation; Simulation and results; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular environments; Vehicular ad hoc networks",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

In multi-hop clustering, sensor nodes closer to the Base Station (BS) deplete their energy faster as compared to far away nodes. Transmission of own data as well as other nodes data by the nearer nodes is the prime cause for this uneven energy consumption. Hence, the nodes closer to the BS die quickly and network gets disconnected, though most of the nodes have adequate energy to communicate. This type of problem is known as hot spot problem in WSN. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop intra-cluster technique in uneven clustering, to minimizing the hot spot and intra-cluster communication problems. The BS divides the whole network into three types of unequal fixed square shaped Grids (clusters). In each cluster, the BS selects a Cluster Head (CH) based on number of hop or neighbour nodes and residual energy of the sensor nodes. Our proposed scheme uses both (centralized and distributed) methods for efficient routing in the network. Formation of all clusters and CH selection are performed centrally, whereas intra and inter-cluster communications are handled in a distributed manner. Here, uneven clusters help to minimize the hot spot problem in WSNs. In order to reduce the intra-cluster routing, we limit the forwarding packets maximum up to two hop in medium size and three hop in large size clusters. The BS checks residual energy of CH and its one hop child nodes after completion of every round. If either CH or one hop neighbours' residual energy is less than or equal to p fraction energy of the total energy, the BS station starts new CH selection process. By keeping intra-cluster communication distance minimum and avoiding rotation of CH in every round, this scheme saves significant amount of energy in WSN. The result obtained through simulation proves the superiority of our protocol in terms of residual energy, number of active nodes and network lifetime as compared to the existing protocols. Though, our protocol sustains upto more than 1000 rounds, proved that it has less hot spot as compared to other existing protocols. © 2017 IEEE.","Cluster head; hot spot; intra-cluster communication; Unequal cluster; Wireless sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster head; Clustering techniques; Energy efficient routing; Hot spot; Intercluster communication; Intra-cluster communication; Unequal cluster; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044229391

Previously, for transmission of bundles the end-To-end connection was required to carry out the transmission successfully. But now, using the store-carry-forward mechanism and the node mobility it is possible to transmit the data from the source to the destination even if there is no end to end connection between them. There are different routing strategies which are formed in a DTN environment to reduce the message overhead and for increasing the message delivery probability, but very few take the energy into a consideration while designing. DTN nodes have a very limited amount of energy resources which holds a great significance. To perform any kind of operation between various nodes, i.e. sending bundle, searching for the neighbor node, storing bundle, etc the energy is used. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a new energy efficient algorithm to improve the energy efficiency. This algorithm forwards the packet to the nearest neighbor node which also uses the probability distribution function to forward the bundle to the next best hop which requires the least energy for the transmission. It also narrows down the specific region for the transmission of data by using the angle based transmission. The freshly energized node is redeployed in the network. With the help of Opportunistic Network Simulator results, it is proven that the designed algorithm is more energy efficient than the previous distance based algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Delay tolerant network; Efficiency; Energy efficient routing protocols; Store and forward","Distribution functions; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Power management (telecommunication); Probability distributions; Routers; Struts; Wireless networks; Distance based algorithm; End-to-end connections; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy efficient routing protocol; Intermittent connectivity; Opportunistic networks; Store and forward; Transmission of data; Delay tolerant networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

Owing to better electromigration resistance, low resistance and dielectric constant, scalability, ability to handle higher current densities and efficient power consumption, copper interconnects have emerged as the widely accepted metallization option to aid silicon performance improvements. At the same time, due to thickness variations and continuous shrinkage of interconnect feature sizes, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes have become challenging.

Integration of IP cores is effectively realized by a scalable communication framework, Network on Chip (NoC). NoC comprises of routers and interconnection links which aid transfer of information between IP cores. It is the router which dominants the performance of NoC. A baseline router incorporates the FIFO (First In First Out) buffers, the routing computation logic, the arbiter and the crossbar switch fabric.

Neuromorphic Engineering is one such domain which aims to exploit the physical characteristics of semiconductors to implement neural systems (and architectures to some extent). Synapse act as connection site and by the virtue of this long lasting connections, learning is exhibited in neural systems where it is governed by Hebbian rule. Memristors can store charge during the training process and respond in a desired manner, electronically mimicking synapse behaviour. The plasticity is achieved by variation in memristance based on the temporal coincidences of pre and post-synaptic spikes. We review the recent progress on the development of 2-Terminal resistive device called memristors to mimic neuronal synapse based on Spike-Timing-dependent plasticity protocol as an asymmetric form of hebbian learning. The properties of memristor such as high density, non-volatility, and recording historic behaviour of current profile with energy efficiency (identical to biological systems) makes it unique and paves a way for memristor-based neuromorphic computing architectures. The use of Memristor to realise synaptic activity provides even further surprising properties in analog CMOS Neuromorphic design. © 2017 IEEE.","Hebbian learning; Memristor; Neuromorphic Engineering; STDP; Synapse","Computer architecture; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Microelectronics; Neurons; Hebbian learning; Memristor; Neuromorphic engineering; STDP; Synapse; Memristors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538617168,,,"English","Int.

It contains efficient urban mobility, efficient public transportation, e-governance, safety and security, smart lighting system, etc. The main focus of this work is to present a design of street light controller to provide a reduction in power consumption and wireless control which eventually will provide a reduction in the required budget of electricity for street lights. Reducing power consumption leads to a reduction in brightness of lamps. This kind of street lighting states to open street lighting that adapts to movement by cars, walkers or cyclists. The system will work as adaptive street lighting. Lights will be obscured when no action is detected and will light up when some movement is detected. For this situation, the lighting framework is not quite the same as old-fashioned, static enlightenment, or dimmable road lighting that diminishes at pre-decided circumstances. Excessive lighting can be banned by targeted dimming of zones of the city, roads or individual luminaires. According to traffic and crowd, the light intensity will be controlled. This paper also incorporates light sensors which will be useful in a rainy environment. Number of street lights will be controlled by the user at a remote place. The complete system will work on RTC where lights will be running at 100% intensity in peak traffic time and with reduced intensity after peak traffic time. © 2017 IEEE.","Centralized user interface; Dimming System; Energy Efficient; LED Street Lights; Pulse width modulation (PWM); Real-Time Control; ZigBee network","Budget control; Controllers; Electric power system control; Electric power utilization; Government data processing; Mass transportation; Microelectronics; Pulse width modulation; Real time control; Smart city; Street lighting; Urban transportation; User interfaces; Voltage control; Zigbee; Dimming systems; Electronic product; Energy efficient; Light intensity; Public transportation; Safety and securities; Wireless control; ZigBee networks; Energy efficiency",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538617168,,,"English","Int.

Over the years various approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational overhead of conventional multipliers. Vedic mathematics has been one among them. In this paper, a novel multiplier unit is proposed which integrates the advantage of each of the sutras. 'Sampoornam' alias 'Absolute vedic' multiplier is designed to have a specialized logic unit that decides which multiplier is to be used for optimum results based on the types of input, improving efficiency. The proposed multiplier Sampoornam is used for designing a 4-bit Multiplier accumulator unit (MAC) unit and is extended up to 64-bit using Vedic scaling technique. Sampoornam is comparatively time efficient than the present day multipliers such as (a-b) algorithm, Booth and Wallace. The 4-bit MAC unit developed using sampoornam has 25 % reduction in time delay compared to MAC developed using Wallace multiplier.

However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant challenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the increase in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful technique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected (maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and maximally clustered mapping. We evaluated the proposed framework by transforming different Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on a wide range of datasets (MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10) and executing them on MCA-based systems to analyze the area and energy benefits. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the area (energy) consumption by 28%-55% (49%-67%) with respect to the original network. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28%-49% (15%-29%) area (energy) savings. Furthermore, TraNNsformer is a technology-aware framework that allows mapping a given DNN to any MCA size permissible by the memristive technology for reliable operations. © 2017 IEEE.","Computer-aided Design; Energy-Efficiency; Memristive Crossbars; Neuromorphic Computing; Sparsity","CMOS integrated circuits; Cognitive systems; Computer aided design; Computer control; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Iterative methods; Low power electronics; Mapping; Metals; MOS devices; Neural networks; Oxide semiconductors; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; Memristive Crossbars; Multi layer perceptron; Neural network transformation; Neuromorphic computing; Redundant connections; Sparsity; Spiking neural networks; Deep neural networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10923152,9781538630938,DICDF,,"English","IEEE ACM Int.

Automation also saves time and helps delivering the product faster. Automating a game play in a card based game is challenging due to the indefinite cards which are served during game play and also due to the fact that the dynamic logic should be applied according to the type of card one receives during game play. A successful approach of building a test automation framework for automating the game play of a single instance of a card based game was achieved previously.[1] This test automation framework is further enhanced to achieve the objective of automating the game play of multiple games of a single player i.e., a player playing multiple instances of the card game simultaneously. The automation is demonstrated in automating the game play of Rummy. However, this approach can be adapted to automate any card based game. The unique approach is discussed and evaluated in achieving this objective. © 2017 IEEE.","Card based game; Cocos-2dx; Multi-game automation; Test automation framework","Computation theory; Software testing; Card based game; Card games; Cocos-2dx; Dynamic logic; Multiple instances; Saves time; Software products; Test automation frameworks; Automation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

This autonomous unmanned vehicle is considered to be navigating in an unknown environment comprising of numerous static objects. The system consists of two Mamdani-FIS controllers. The first controller is a Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) system which is used by the autonomous vehicle to avoid collision with an obstacle. The second controller is also a MISO system, which is a path planning fuzzy controller, and it is used to reach the destination. The three inputs to the first controller are left, right and front sensor inputs of the autonomous vehicle in order to detect the obstacles. There are two inputs to the second controller, first one determines the error between the desired orientation and the current orientation of the autonomous vehicle and second is the linear velocity of the autonomous vehicle. This linear velocity is predefined. The output of both the controllers are the angular velocities, which are added after being multiplied by predefined weights to give the final angular velocity of the vehicle. MATLAB software package was used for simulation experiments for three different scenarios namely; a cluttered obstacle environment, a long walled obstacle environment and random obstacle shapes environment in order to scrutinize the feasibility of the proposed FIS technique. The simulation results conveyed that FIS can perform the navigation and path planning tasks safely and efficiently in an environment with randomly distributed static objects. The results when compared with other approaches like neural-networks, ANFIS, Genetic algorithm and other techniques in terms of the computational time and ease of implementation were much more efficient found to be giving an error with acceptable tolerance. © 2017 IEEE.","autonomous navigation systems; Fuzzy Logic; obstacle avoidance; path planning; static environment","Angular velocity; Collision avoidance; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Controllers; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; MATLAB; Motion planning; Navigation systems; Unmanned vehicles; Vehicles; Velocity; Autonomous navigation systems; Autonomous unmanned vehicles; Fuzzy inference systems; MATLAB software package; Multiple input single output systems; Navigation and path planning; Randomly distributed; Static environment; Fuzzy inference",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

The objective of feature extraction is to extract features from speech and captures the unique characteristics of a individual speaker. The proposed method can be used in noisy environment with high degree of accuracy. The proposed method is based on the wavelet transform and the input speech signal is decomposed into various frequency channels. The purpose of Wavelet transform is to find the frequency spectrum while wavelet cepstral coefficient is used to capture the characteristic of the signal. It is more suitable than Fourier transform because it is restricted in both time and frequency whereas fourier transform is only restricted in frequency. The proposed method is capable to reduce the noise as well as also improves recognition effectively. Fuzzy rules are used for decision making.

One of the main challenges for designing an object tracking technique is energy conservation. Prediction based strategies are used to save energy. We consider an application where a WSN is installed in a forest for tracking the movement of animals (objects). Since, animals move in certain paths rather moving entirely randomly, we attempt to use this property. The movement patterns of the objects are extracted using a data mining technique. This information is used to predict the object movement with the aim to reduce the energy consumption in tracking. In situations where the prediction is erroneous, we propose a systematic recovery mechanism. The recovery mechanism has three levels. The number of additional nodes woken up progressively increases with the increase in the recovery level. If an object has been detected at a lower level, normal operations are resumed. It is observed that there are significant energy savings due to this systematic recovery mechanism. The proposed technique, called DESPOT, is fully distributed and energy efficient. We have carried out extensive simulation of DESPOT and have compared its performance with an existing technique, called PTSP. Simulation results show that DESPOT conserves significant energy and it has a better tracking efficiency than PTSP. © 2017 IEEE.","data mining; distributed; prediciton; tracking; wireless sensor networks","Animals; Computer system recovery; Data mining; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Object detection; Recovery; Surface discharges; Tracking (position); distributed; Energy efficient; Extensive simulations; Normal operations; Prediciton; Prediction-based; Recovery mechanisms; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

The need for energy efficient and high speed analog-to-digital converters is necessary for the use of dynamic regenerative comparators to improve speed and efficiency of power. Fast ADCs, such as flash ADCs, requires an energy efficient comparator with small chip area. In this work comparison is performed among the delay of single Tail comparator, Double Tail Comparator and double tail comparator for less power theoretically and practically. The sub threshold leakage of transistors has usually been very small in the off state, as gate voltage is below threshold. The leakage from all sources has increased as the technology scales down. But as voltages have been scaled down with transistor size, sub threshold leakage has become a considerable factor. Fast comparators in CMOS having the problem of less rail voltages when threshold-voltages(Vt) of the devices are not scaled at the same speed as the rail voltages of the latest CMOS techniques. The proposed work consumes less power about 290mW compared to other types of comparators.

Since virtualization is the foundational element of cloud computing and helps to achieve the benefits of cloud computing, security from virtualization becomes a major goal for the cloud based systems. Virtualization aims to create virtual versions of resources such as processors, memory, storage, network interfaces and devices for virtual machines (VMs), allowing the same set of resources to be shared among various VMs so that they can run together on the same hardware without knowing about each other's presence. Despite its indisputable benefits, data security vulnerabilities and performance degradation from the user's viewpoint, remain the main cause of concern, motivating fervent research involving hardware and software improvements for alleviating the two concerns. However, implementation and proper testing of these innovations is not easy with hardware, hybrid or API based software simulators, due to high implementation costs, absence of simulators capable of testing solutions that span multiple levels of hardware and software, and the different privilege levels of instructions. This is more relevant when the improvements proposed include instruction set modifications at different privilege levels. In this paper, we propose a different simulation approach - multikernel simulation approach. This is different from the conventional software-based simulation techniques in that we utilize the different privilege levels of the various kernels running on the server, and leverage them to distribute the components and logic that need to be simulated, into different levels of software, to simulate the effect of using it on the required privilege level. To accomplish this, we identify unused bits in the kernel software and use them to simulate hardware conditions. We implement and demonstrate this simulation technique for the Extended-HyperWall and RSDM architecture [1], [2], which is a hardware-based solution to improve the security of virtual machines in a fully virtualized environment, in the presence of an untrusted hypervisor (an entity that manages VMs), against rollback based attacks.

In erasure code based storage systems, the allocation of storage nodes for storing data is to be done with care so that the load on the nodes of the storage system is always balanced.

However, due to path restriction, a constant speed is assigned with mobile sink and this has limited the time for communication to collect the sensor data in randomly deployed sensor networks. Further, the collection of sensor data increases the consumption of power in such network. Hence to improve this cluster based block wise compressed path constrained sensing is introduced in clustered sensor networks. Here, two techniques are deployed to reduce the consumption of power in sensor network. To limit the communication time in collecting the sensor data, the shortest path tree computation is used. Also, to reduce the inherent data sparsity block wise compression over spatially correlated data is used. The collection of data is done by the cluster heads and forwarded to the base stations (BSs) using shortest path tree computation. This is formulated as a mixed linear integer programming problem, which is solved using adaptive amoeba algorithm. The block wise compression method uses compressed sensing (CS) in clustered WSN and the measurement is done through block diagonal matrix. The forwarding of CS measurements is done through shortest path algorithm and this relays the measurements to the BSs. The validation is carried out in terms of total consumed power due to the effect of sparsity and transferring the CS measurements to BS. The performance is evaluated based on optimal clustering for attaining reduced power consumption. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher throughput with increased energy efficiency than the other conventional methods. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Adaptive amoeba algorithm; Block diagonal matrix; Compressed sensing; Shortest path tree","Compressed sensing; Data acquisition; Data reduction; Energy efficiency; Graph theory; Integer programming; Matrix algebra; Protozoa; Trees (mathematics); Block diagonal matrices; Clustered sensor networks; Clustered wireless sensor networks; Conventional methods; Linear integer programming; Reduced power consumption; Shortest path algorithms; Shortest path tree; Wireless sensor networks","Lakshminarayanan, R.; Anna University, S R S College of Engineering & TechnologyIndia; email: luckilux86@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037615351

This results in high energy dissipation of the devices. Thus, balancing of energy consumption is a major concern in such kind of network. Appropriate cluster head (CH) selection may provide to be an efficient way to reduce the energy dissipation and prolonging the network lifetime in WSN. This paper has adopted the concept of fuzzy if-then rules to choose the cluster head based on certain fuzzy descriptors. To optimise the fuzzy membership functions, particle swarm optimisation has been used to improve their ranges. Moreover, recent study has confirmed that the introduction of a mobile collector in a network which collects data through short-range communications also aids in high energy conservation. In this work, the network is divided into clusters and a mobile collector starts from the static sink or base station and moves through each of these clusters and collect data from the chosen cluster heads in a single-hop fashion. Mobility based on ant-colony optimisation has already proven to be an efficient method which is utilised in this work. Additionally, instead of performing clustering in every round, CH is selected on demand. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with some existing clustering algorithms.

Clustering of the mobile nodes ensures efficient use of available bandwidth and high network throughput. Various clustering schemes are developed to improve the energy efficiency and lifetime of the network. However, there is an increase in the energy consumption with the increase in the number of clusters for forwarding data. This paper presents an energy-efficient clustering approach for collaborative data forwarding in mobile ad hoc network. The cluster head (CH) is selected based on the processing capability of the nodes and link connection metrics. The CH receives the data from the server and forwards the data to the member nodes at a corresponding data rate of the nodes. Data offloading technique manages the data traffic in the network. The CH rejoining approach enables load balancing in the network. The proposed clustering approach achieves a significant reduction in the energy consumption and data traffic and improvement in the throughput rate through stable routing.

Clustering in WSNs significantly reduces the energy consumption in which the nodes are organized in clusters, each having a cluster head (CH). The CHs collect data from their cluster members and transmit it to the base station via a single or multihop communication. The main issue in such mechanism is how to associate the nodes to CHs and how to route the data of CHs so that the overall load on CHs are balanced. Since the sensor nodes operate autonomously, the methods designed for WSNs should be of distributed nature, i.e., each node should run it using its local information only. Considering these issues, we propose a distributed multiobjective-based clustering method to assign a sensor node to appropriate CH so that the load is balanced. We also propose an energy-efficient routing algorithm to balance the relay load among the CHs. In case any CH dies, we propose a recovery strategy for its cluster members. All our proposed methods are completely distributed in nature. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption and hence prolonging the network lifetime. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with some existing algorithms in terms of number of alive nodes, network lifetime, energy efficiency, and energy population.

Discretization before attribute reduction will result in high computation cost as many irrelevant and redundant attributes need to be discretized. Attribute reduction before discretization may result in over-fitting of the data leading to low performance of the induction algorithm. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid algorithm using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and extended forward tentative selection with backward propagation of selection decision (EFTSBPSD) algorithm for attribute reduction on real-valued data in rough set theory (RST). Based on the principle of indiscernibility, the hybrid ABC–EFTSBPSD algorithm performs discretization and attribute reduction together. The hybrid ABC–EFTSBPSD algorithm takes as input the decision system consisting of real-valued attributes and determines a near optimal set of irreducible cuts. Here, optimality of the set of irreducible cuts is defined in terms of the cardinality of the set of irreducible cuts. Reduct is obtained from the determined approximate optimal set of irreducible cuts by extracting the attributes corresponding to the cuts in the obtained set of irreducible cuts. The proposed hybrid algorithm is tested on various data sets from University of California Machine Learning Repository. Experimental results obtained by the proposed hybrid algorithm are compared with those obtained by the Q-MDRA, ACO-RST and IMCVR algorithms described in the literature and found to give better classification accuracy when tested using (1) C4.5 classifier and (2) SVM classifier. The proposed hybrid algorithm has also shown reduced length of the reduct in comparison with the results obtained by Q-MDRA, ACO-RST and IMCVR algorithms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Attribute reduction; Boolean reasoning; Discretization; FTSBPSD algorithm; Indiscernibility; Rough set theory","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Data reduction; Decision theory; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Set theory; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Attribute reduction; Boolean reasoning; Discretizations; Indiscernibility; Rough set theory","Chebrolu, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology WarangalIndia; email: srilatha.chebrolu@nitw.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983390094

Wireless NoCs, by augmenting wired topologies with low latency wireless links, overcome performance limitations of conventional NoCs. However, NoC routers and Wireless Interfaces (WIs) consume significant amount of leakage power. The usage of routers in NoC is application dependent and for most applications, performance requirement can be achieved without operating all resources all the time. Similarly, WIs transmitting data over shared channel can be selectively turned off when they are not active. Exploiting these, we propose Power- and Performance-aware NoC (P2NoC) architecture that power gates router elements and WIs depending upon their utilization to reduce leakage power. P2NoC works based on hybrid two-level router utilization estimate; pre-computed and runtime to provide coarse and fine estimate of utilization to maximize power saving while keeping overheads and performance impact to a minimum. We also propose deadlock-free seamless bypass routing strategy with P2NoC to avoid adverse impacts of power gating. P2NoC saves up to 92.20% and 68.23% of leakage power in base and hybrid routers respectively with only 7% area overhead. Based on utilization, P2NoC also reduces total average packet energy consumption by 49% with negligible performance degradation.

For example, WSN can be used to perform data collection in war field. However the qualities of service of WSN depending on various operations like routing and scheduling. Numerous routing protocols are being addressed to solve the scheduling problems in wireless sensor networks. But they suffer with poor QoS values. To address these issues, an energy efficient multi attribute time slot scheduling (MATSS) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is focused to extend the lifetime of sensor nodes with multi part dynamic routing (MPDR) neighbour conditions and previous time slot conditions. Based on both the values the node has been scheduled as sleep/wakeup mode and this will be performed for each time slot. The selection of node is performed according to the condition of neighbour nodes and energy parameter by sharing the information between them.

The wireless sensor nodes in sensor network are powered using rechargeable batteries. However, providing energy to nodes in the remote environment is a major issue in WSN. Hence WSN needs a new energy efficient algorithm to enhance the network lifetime. In a sensor node, the transceiving module consumes more energy when compared to other modules. In this paper, a Battery Recovery based Lifetime Enhancement (BRLE) algorithm is discussed, which considers battery voltage curve for scheduling the transceiving module of the sensor nodes. The Markov model helps in determining the state of the sensor node as CH and CM based on battery recovery process. By scheduling the transceiving module based on the battery terminal voltage, recovery factor and distance between the nodes, the lifetime of the network is enhanced. Experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms the others by 1.38 times increased lifetime and 1.574 times increased throughput. The BRLE decreases the HOT SPOT and energy hole problem, avoiding loss in connectivity with the sink. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Energy efficient; Energy management policy; Hot spot; Recovery effect; Voronoi; Wireless sensor network","Computer system recovery; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Markov processes; Recovery; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Sensor nodes; Energy efficient; Energy-hole problems; Hot spot; Lifetime enhancement; Recovery effects; Remote environment; Voronoi; Wireless sensor node; Wireless sensor networks","Mahima, V.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Krishna College of Technology, Kovaipudur, India; email: mahi.90may@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027862610

Over the past decade, several research works have explored approximate computing at both the software level and hardware level of abstraction with encouraging results. At the hardware level of abstraction, adders (being the fundamental and most widely used data operators in digital systems) have attracted a significant attention for approximation. In this article, we first explain briefly the need/significance of approximate adders. We then propose four Approximate Full Adders (AFAs) for high-performance energy-efficient approximate computing. The key design objective behind the proposed AFAs is to curtail the length of carry propagation subjected to minimal error rate. Next, we exploit one of the proposed AFAs (optimal one) to construct an N-bit approximate adder that hereinafter is referred as ""ApproxADD."" An emergent property of ApproxADD is that carries do not propagate in it, and, consequently, it provides bit-width-aware constant delay (O(1)). ApproxADD also provides improvement in dynamic power consumption by 46.31%and in area by 28.57% w.r.t. Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), which exhibits the lowest power and area. Although ApproxADD provides a significant improvement in delay, power, and area, it may not be preferred for some of the error-resilient applications because its: (i) Error Distance (ED) is too high; and (ii) Error Rate (ER) increases rapidly with bit-width (N). To improve ED and ER, we exploit the concept of carry-lifetime and Error Detection and Correction logic, respectively. In this way, we introduce two more (improved) versions of ApproxADD-ApproxADDv1 and ApproxADD.We call these as ApproxADDv1 and ApproxADDv2 with existing approximate adders based on conventional design metrics and approximate computing design metrics. Furthermore, to inspect effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-life applications, we demonstrate image compression and decompression by replacing the conventional addition operations in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) modules with ApproxADDv2. © 2017 ACM.","Approximate adders; Approximate computing; Delay-power-area-accuracy trade-off; Error-resilient applications","Abstracting; Bit error rate; Carry logic; Computation theory; Discrete cosine transforms; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Errors; Hardware; Image compression; Inverse transforms; Approximate computing; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Dynamic power consumption; Error detection and correction; Error-resilient; Inverse discrete cosine transforms; Real-life applications; Trade off; Adders",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15399087,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

Fragmentation is posing an enormous challenge for development community, and solutions are designed per case basis. There are solutions developed in the domain of graphics and Web access, but as far as the fragmentation with core framework is considered, the solution is still missing.

A number of range-based and range-free localization algorithms have been proposed in last two decades. Range-based schemes attain higher localization accuracy at the cost of extra ranging hardware whereas; range-free schemes are cost effective but show poor localization accuracy. In order to improve the localization accuracy, we have proposed dynamic range normal bisector (DRNB) algorithm which is a distributed range-free localization approach. In DRNB, connectivity between nodes, dynamic ranges of anchor nodes, and principle of normal bisector are used to determine the location of nodes. Each anchor node transmits beacon packets at two different range levels in the network. Each normal node estimates its location by calculating the centre point of the overlapping region of the communication ranges of neighbouring anchors where it lies. Normal bisector technique is used to find the centre point of this overlapping region. Sometimes estimated location of a node may fall out of this overlapping region. To overcome this problem, correction factor has also been proposed. DRNB is an energy efficient algorithm, as it doesn’t require the exchange of information between neighbouring nodes. Analysis and simulation results show that DRNB performs better compared to other existing range-free schemes (e.g. centroid, restricted area based localization and mid-perpendicular algorithm). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Correction factor; Dynamic anchor range; Normal bisector technique; Range-free localization; WSN","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Location; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Correction factors; Energy efficient algorithms; Exchange of information; Localization algorithm; Normal bisector technique; Range free localization; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Sharma, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, CVR College of EngineeringIndia; email: ergaurav209@yahoo.co.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026800270

They are used to monitor surroundings and sense details. They might be deployed in hostile environments as well. Security of communications over WSN is very important. Unlike their wired counterparts, WSNs throws many challenges such as open network architecture, highly dynamic network topology besides there resource constrained nature. Therefore a scheme is required to protect communications in an energy efficient fashion. There are many existing key distribution schemes for WSN in the literature. However, most of them are static in nature. In this paper we explore a new key distribution scheme for dynamic WSNs. In such network where the nodes are dynamic and nodes have mobility, it is essential to have a mechanism to update keys. This is achieved using a self-organizing binary tree known as AVL tree. This data structure is capable of adapting to the dynamic situations of WSN and updates the key values in real time. We proposed algorithms to achieve this. We also built a prototype application that demonstrates the application of the scheme for secure video distribution in a network. Our empirical results reveal that the proposed scheme is secure and energy efficient. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

In the system without Eve, we assume that each user knows only its own channel gain and is completely ignorant about the other users’ channel state. The legitimate receiver sends a short acknowledgement message Acknowledge (ACK) if the message is correctly decoded and a No Acknowledge (NACK) if the message is not correctly decoded. Under these assumptions, we use game theoretic learning setup to make transmitters learn about the power allocation under each state. We use multiplicative weight no-regret algorithm to achieve an ε-coarse correlated equilibrium. We also consider the case where a user can receive other users’ ACK/NACK messages. Now, we can maximize a weighted sum utility and achieve Pareto optimal points. We also obtain Nash bargaining solutions, which are Pareto points that are fairer to the transmitting users. Fairness among users is quantified using Jain’s index. With Eve, we first assume each user knows only its own channel gain to the receiver as well as to Eve. The receiver decides whether to send an ACK or a NACK to the transmitting user based on the secrecy-rate condition. We use the above developed algorithms to get the equilibrium points. Next, we study the case where each user knows only the distribution of the channel state of Eve. Finally, we also consider the system where the users do not know even the distribution of the Eve’s channel. © 2017, The Author(s).","Coarse correlated equilibrium; Fading channel; Multiple access wiretap channel; Nash bargaining; Physical layer security; Power control","Communication channels (information theory); Computation theory; Decoding; Fading channels; Game theory; Network layers; Pareto principle; Power control; Correlated equilibria; Game-theoretic learning; Multiple access channels; Nash bargaining; Nash bargaining solution; Physical layer security; Power allocations; Wire-tap channels; Education","Shah, S.M.; Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, CV Raman Avenue, India; email: shahid.nit@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",16871472,,,,"English","Eurasip J.

This paper tries to investigate the current state of side-channel vulnerabilities involving the central processing unit cache and identifies the shortcomings of earlier defenses in a Cloud environment. Through cache-based SCA, fined grained information can be collected by attacker easily, and this information may be used by the attacker to infer meaningful results like a secret key, etc. In this article, we detect the SCA at an earlier stage through flush-reload based statistical techniques which exploit the vulnerabilities of Square and Multiply algorithm. Upon detection of SCA, we proposed random permutation function for cache mapping to hide the pattern of cache replacement policy.

In this research work, the severity of cracks in the supporting column is assessed using a new technique. This piece of research study uses the soft computing method of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to model the domain experts’ knowledge and the knowledge assimilated through relevant literature to grade the severity of cracks in supporting column. The FCM grading model is further improved by using the Hebbian learning algorithms. The presented work demonstrates the classification and prediction capabilities of FCM for the respective structural health monitoring application, using two well-known and efficient FCM learning approaches viz. nonlinear Hebbian learning (NHL) and data-driven nonlinear Hebbian learning (DD-NHL). The proposed crack severity grading model classifies the cracks in supporting column into three categories, namely fine crack, moderate crack and severe crack. The proposed model uses DD-NHL algorithm. DD-NHL is trained with 70 records and tested with 30 records and gives an overall classification accuracy of 96 %. The obtained results are better compared to other popular machine learning-based classifiers. The proposed method helps even the non-experts to find the possible causes of crack and reports them to structural engineers, to start maintenance in an appropriate stage, using various crack control techniques. Also, a software tool for crack categorization was developed based on the FCM method and its learning capabilities.

A compressed block in DRAM also reduces the transfer time over the memory bus to the caches, reducing the latency of a LLC cache miss. Usually, compression is achieved by exploiting data patterns present within a block. But applications can exhibit data locality that spread across multiple consecutive data blocks.We observe that there is significant opportunity available for compressing multiple consecutive data blocks into one single block, both at the LLC and DRAM. Our studies using 21 SPEC CPU applications show that, at the LLC, around 25% (on average) of the cache blocks can be compressed into one single cache block when grouped together in groups of 2 to 8 blocks. In DRAM, more than 30% of the columns residing in a single DRAM page can be compressed into one DRAM column, when grouped together in groups of 2 to 6. Motivated by these observations, we propose a mechanism, namely, MBZip, that compresses multiple data blocks into one single block (called a zipped block), both at the LLC and DRAM. At the cache, MBZip includes a simple tag structure to index into these zipped cache blocks and the indexing does not incur any redirectional delay. At the DRAM, MBZip does not need any changes to the address computation logic and works seamlessly with the conventional/existing logic. MBZip is a synergistic mechanism that coordinates these zipped blocks at the LLC and DRAM. Further, we also explore silent writes at the DRAM and show that certain writes need not access the memory when blocks are zipped. MBZip improves the system performance by 21.9%, with a maximum of 90.3% on a 4-core system. © 2017 ACM.","CPU cache; Memory; Performance","Cache memory; Computation theory; Data storage equipment; Dynamic random access storage; Address computation; Compression techniques; Data locality; Effective capacity; Improving systems; Last-level caches; Performance; Synergistic mechanism; Data compression",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15443566,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

As the HOM act as residue, the proposed method results in an improved filtering accuracy. Further, the proposition is extended in delayed measurement environment.

In the case of finitebuffer batch arrival queue, there are different customer rejection/acceptance strategies such as partial batch rejection, total batch rejection, and total batch acceptance policy. We consider partial batch rejection strategy throughout our paper. We obtain queue length distributions at various epochs such as pre-arrival, arbitrary, and post-departure as well as some important performance measures, like probability of loss for the first, an arbitrary, and the last customer of a batch, mean queue lengths, and mean waiting times. The corresponding queueing model under single and multiple vacation policy has also been investigated. Some numerical results have been presented in the form of tables by considering phase-type and Pareto service time distributions. The proposed analysis is based on the successive substitutions in the Markov chain equations of the queuelength distribution at an embedded post-departure epoch of a customer. We also establish relationships among the queue-length distributions at post-departure, arbitrary, and pre-arrival epochs using the classical argument based on Markov renewal theory and semi-Markov processes.

Further, we introduce a network price paid for the consumed power as a penalty for the achievable sum rate and formulate a resource allocation problem subject to limited transmit power budget and QoS constraints. The formulated problem is a nonconvex binary mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and it is hard to solve the problem. We then apply a concave lower bound on the pricing-based network utility to transform the problem into a convex one. The dual decomposition method is adopted to propose a $\pounds $-price resource allocation algorithm to find the near-optimal solution. Next, we discuss the optimal utility-price from an EE perspective. Moreover, we rigorously analyze the behavior of the network pricing-based resource allocation in two-user case under different noise operating regimes, and discuss the corresponding strategies for achieving energy-efficient transmission, generating water-filling and channel-reversal approaches. To strike a balance between the computational complexity and the optimality, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithm to maximize the EE of multiuser multirelay full-duplex (FD) relay networks and the relay networks with an eavesdropper.

The power and energy consumption of the HPC system is the identified concerns in the realization of the next generation supercomputers. Achieving Exaflop performance within the 20-megawatt of targeted power consumption is a very daunting task. The effective and intelligent power management is the key to achieving energy efficiency. In order to address the power consumption concerns, there is a need for an effective power management framework, which can manage and optimize power consumption of the nodes in an adaptive and intelligent manner. The fine-grained power measurement, workload characterization, and autonomous decision-making capabilities are the keys to an effective power management. This paper presents a self-adaptive power management framework for HPC systems. The devised framework is based on software-based power measurement methodologies, Application-aware power profiling, and energyefficient rescheduling of the workloads for the energy optimization. The devised framework uses the available knobs of the power-managed components for controlling the energy consumption.

Initial concentrations have been taken from experimental data in literature and were used to model the changes. Results generated by dopaminergic diseased pathway show 45% decrease in dopamine, compared to normal condition. In addition, the activity of MOMP, Caspase 9 and Apoptosome expression in diseased condition within mitochondrial pathway model have been observed in the results.

These low power sensor nodes consume energy for data routing to destination i.e., sink. Sensor node dies once it all energy is exhausted. This creates an unstable network. Hence, it is a key challenging task to increase the stability period of the network i.e., the time interval before the first node is dead. To address this key problem, in this paper a novel evolutionary based routing algorithm named Green Stable Evolutionary Routing Algorithm (GSERA) is proposed. This algorithm aims at prolonging the stability period. This in response improves the energy efficiency and reliability of the WSNs. The simulations of GSERA over 45 WSNs is found and compared with the state-of-the-art evolutionary based Evolutionary Routing Protocol (ERP). We found that GSERA ensures longer stability period than ERP. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Energy efficiency; Low power electronics; Power management (telecommunication); Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Data routing; Efficiency and reliability; Low power sensor; Specific tasks; State of the art; Time interval; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Evolutionary algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

This paper describes the work carried out in the organization to validate the complex and critical Mode-Transition Logic (MTL) in Automated Flight Control System (AFCS) being developed in the organization. The Mode-Transition Logic (MTL) of the AFCS system is re-modeled using SAML and further analyzed with model checkers such as PRISM and NuSMV, for generation of counter-examples. The counter examples helped in mapping the safety scenarios along the AFCS requirements. These counter examples also helped in generating the fault model and analyzing the system logic for fault tolerance. Using NUSMV, MTL the failure scenarios were generated and the allowed transitions were studied. Failure management analysis report is generated and mapped as an artefact for the certification. For the illustration of the proposed approach, a suitable framework viz. Verification Environment for Safety-Critical Systems (VECS) is used to validate the utility of Mode-Transition Logic (MTL) in Automated Flight Control System (AFCS). The critical operations and complex functions were analyzed for contingency situations and provide means in significantly enhancing the safe operation of the Safety- Critical System.

In many scenarios, the coverage area of the WSN will be very large and a multi-hop adhoc network needs to be maintained for the connectivity and data transfer among the nodes. The major part of the energy consumption of each node is used for data transfer among nodes. This paper proposes a energy efficient routing scheme. The scenario which is considered is a wireless sensor network which is a collection of clusters and data transfer happens with the help of cluster head (CH) rather than the collective effort of every node in the network. In such a cluster based WSN, it is advantageous to have a routing protocol which uses the information about clusters to decide upon route formation. This paper proposes a novel Cluster Based Routing Protocol for a WSN which optimizes the energy consumption on data transfer and thus increasing the lifetime of the WSN network. To conclude the advantages of the proposed scheme, comparison is carried out between the performance of AODV and CBRP protocols. © 2017 IEEE.","Cluster Based WSN; Data Aggregation; Data Transmission; Energy Efficiency; On Demand Routing; Routing Protocols; Wireless Sensor Networks","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Patient monitoring; Power management (telecommunication); Remote patient monitoring; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Structural health monitoring; Virtual reality; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster-based; Data aggregation; Disaster management; Energy efficient routing; On demand routing protocols; On-demand routing; Search and rescue operations; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Whatever action is done by human being is ultimately to be happy. Aristotle called it the summum bonnum or chief good in life. In recent times people have not become happier than earlier generations even though there is a drastic improvement in technology and lifestyle standards. Increasing narcissism as found out by some researchers may be one of the causes of this. Self-actualization need which forms the apex of the famous hierarchy of needs theory propounded by Maslow is supposed to make a person very grounded and happy by focussing on the fulfillment of his potential as against social approval which the narcissists crave so much. In this study the relationship between self-actualization, narcissism and happiness has been studied empirically. The data was collected from 200 respondents from across India using established scales to measure these three constructs, and analyze their relationship. As predicted by the literature, it was found that higher level of self-actualization led to lower level of narcissism. Also, narcissism and happiness are negatively related to each other, whereas self-actualization is positively related with happiness. The 'r' values for all these relations were quite strong and significant (p = 0.05) at above 0.4 for the first two and above 0.6 for the last relationship. © 2017 IEEE.","Happiness; Narcissism; Self actualization","Computation theory; Happiness; Human being; Narcissism; Self actualization; Behavioral research",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

RPL provides opportunities for improving overall performance of LLN by providing mechanisms for efficient and secured routing. In this regard, the paper focuses on two objectives. First objective is to analyze the performance of existing link quality and trust based calculations of RPL using J-Sim Simulator. Second objective is to propose some improved methods for calculating trust such that the new variant of RPL will be able to detect and resolve the On-Off attacks which the RPL is unable to do so far. Results and analysis provided in the later part of this paper shows that enhanced RPL variant is able to detect and resolve on-off security attack without introducing any extra performance overhead, thus making the RPL more secured.

The difficulty in MANET is to find a feasible path between communicating nodes as routing is non-deterministic polynomial hard which is due to mobile nature of nodes. Many past works focused on finding a feasible path from a source to destination by considering only a single parameter i.e. the shortest path using hop counts only. This causes path failure due to high node mobility and computed path which may not be available for longer time. So, nodes start path discovery in order to establish connection between communicating nodes. To minimize this overhead, we propose a novel approach for routing in MANET by using Cuckoo Search algorithm (CS) on Ad-hoc Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV), called CS-AOMDV. This computes the paths with high fitness values so that data packets can be transferred successfully from source to destination by considering routing load in terms of delay, energy efficiency metric and hop count. The cuckoo search algorithm is integrated with AOMDV protocol during the Route Reply (RRPLY) process, where multiple routes are available and maintained at source node having higher fitness values. Through simulation using ns-2, we have observed that our proposed routing algorithm outperforms over AOMDV in terms of delay, packet loss, packet delivery ratio and throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","AODV; AOMDV; Cuckoo search; MANET","Ad hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Learning algorithms; Network routing; Optimization; Packet networks; Power management (telecommunication); AODV; AOMDV; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; MANET; Meta-heuristic approach; Multi path routing; Packet delivery ratio; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Large scale neural simulations using high performance and distributed computing techniques produce huge amount of data for which visual analysis is generally difficult to perform. In this paper, a spiking neuron simulation environment was created to model and simulate networks of neurons of the cerebellum. Traditional visualization techniques were used to highlight relevant findings from small scale cerebellar networks. Time varying volume visualization using traditional techniques was found infeasible as network size increased. New data abstractions were required to depict the data that changes over time. With large scale cerebellar networks, Information theoretic methods were used to reduce dimensionality and to extract valuable information from data. We suggested that, information theory can be used as an efficient scientific data analysis and visualization tool to evaluate and validate computational models of cerebellar like structures. © 2017 IEEE.","Cerebellum; Information theory; Large scale simulation; Spiking neuron models; Visualization","Brain; Computation theory; Data visualization; Distributed computer systems; Flow visualization; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Neurons; Visualization; Cerebellum; Information-theoretic methods; Large scale simulations; Scientific data analysis; Simulation environment; Spiking neural networks; Spiking neuron models; Visualization technique; Neural networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

These gliders use the speed of free fall and the change in their body shape to generate lift. Despite their lack of appendages, their ability to glide has piqued the interest of many. Hence, modeling the flight of these snakes has received considerable attention in the recent past. Experimental studies have been done in the past on live flying snakes to understand their unusual glide mechanism. Equilibrium glide ' in which the speed of the center of gravity of the snake is more or less constant - is relatively easier to model than nonequilibrium glide where this speed changes with time. Flying snakes spend most of their flight in non-equilibrium glide than on equilibrium glide. An earlier model for generating the undulating shape generated realistic shapes at a specified time. However, many parameters needed to be fine-tuned along with unforeseen singularities. Further, it generated the centerline shape of the snake in a plane, but could not consider out of plane undulation of the snake. In the current work, a better model for the undulating motion of the snake is proposed which is extended to include out of plane motion of the snake's centerline. The aerodynamic forces acting on the snake at an instant of time are computed using thin airfoil theory and blade element theory. With the help of these, the velocities and trajectory of the snake's flight path are computed and compared with data available in literature. This model has potential for application in biological and biomechanical study of the flight of flying snakes, study of unconventional Micro-aerial vehicle and physics based computer animation. © 2017 IEEE.","Biological modeling; Chrysopelea paradisi; Flying Snakes; Nonequilibrium glide; Physics based computer animation; Unconventional MAVs; Undulation","Animation; Antennas; Computation theory; Biological modeling; Chrysopelea paradisi; Computer animation; Flying Snakes; Non equilibrium; Unconventional MAVs; Undulation; Micro air vehicle (MAV)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Due to the use of random deployment strategy in such areas, the load must be balanced equally among the sensor nodes for efficient utilization of energy and extending the network life time. Hence, an efficient load balancing algorithm is proposed for grid-based clustering where merging and splitting of clusters is devised for sparse and dense clusters respectively and cross clustering is applied for averagely dense clusters. We have used multi-hop communication among the Cluster Heads (CHs) which reduces the energy consumption as well. The decision of cluster members to join adjoining cluster depends on its distance from both its current CH and adjoining CH. Thus communication of data, that requires the highest amount of energy, will be done for a short distance. Hence, the amount of energy spent by cluster members in communicating is also reduced. The overhead comparison with an existing algorithm depicts that the proposed algorithm being centralized in nature generates asymptotically the same amount of control packets as a distributed approach does. Our algorithm can perform better in terms of energy consumption and load balancing which eventually increases the network lifetime and minimizes creation of energy holes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cluster; Cluster Head; Energy Efficient; Grid; Load Balance; Wireless Sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Cluster head; Energy efficient; Grid; Load balance; Clustering algorithms",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353243,,,"English","ACM Int.

It is most important to develop energy efficient cluster head (CH) selection scheme to increase the network lifetime of WSNs. It is most crucial to save the energy of these sensor nodes to avoid quick battery drain. In this work, a dynamic CH selection method (DCHSM) is proposed to extend the network lifetime of the systems developed for IoT applications. At first the concept of Voronoi diagram is utilized to divide the large scale monitoring area into small clusters in order to ensure maximum coverage and then the CH is selected in two stages. The first stage of the CH selection is based on perceived probability and the second stage is based on the survival time estimation.

Applicability of the field in almost all domains support the claim, reasons being the ability of these networks to work efficiently even in harsh environments. Instead of all nodes participating in the sensing process, a better approach is data aggregation with clustering as its direct application. Selection of cluster representatives/heads is a crucial task mainly because the performance of any clustering protocol mainly depends on this criterion. Recently, a fuzzy logic based selection criterion was proposed. However, the round-by-round approach of the authors added to the complexity in the network in terms of the number of messages exchanged between the nodes per round. An improvement to the same is proposed in this paper aiming at minimizing this message complexity and thereby reducing the energy consumption and maximizing lifetime of the sensor network. © 2017 IEEE.","clustering; data aggregation; energy efficiency; fuzzy logic; maximized lifetime in WSNs; Wireless Sensor Networks","Complex networks; Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Based clustering; clustering; Clustering protocol; Data aggregation; Fuzzy logic-based selection criterions; Harsh environment; maximized lifetime in WSNs; Message complexity; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

As the application areas of the WSN are increasing at the same rate the security threats are also increasing. Intruders are applying various mechanisms to access the sensible and confidential data from sensors. Hence, strong security measures are much needed to immune WSNs from various attacks. Authentication is a security mechanism that protects WSNs from wide range of security attacks. In this paper, an authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is based on tokens. Any node when deployed in WSN is embedded with base station's public key and through the corresponding cluster head; it requests and acquires its token for authentication from the base station. The generated token is light in weight and reduces much of computational, communicational and storage overheads. The proposed protocol is verified for its security both formally and automatically. The proposed protocol is proved to be secure by evaluation in BAN logic and found SAFE by AVISPA-a model checker tool for testing authentication protocol. © 2017 IEEE.","Dynamic; Light weight; Node authentication; Token; Wireless Sensor Networks","Authentication; Base stations; Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital storage; Dynamics; Internet protocols; Model checking; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication protocols; Confidential data; Light weight; Mutual authentication; Node authentications; Security mechanism; Strong securities; Token; Network security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

In each cluster, a sensor is fixed as cluster head (CH) and continuous energy is supplied to it ensuring that it will be active all the time. All the sensors connected to the patients will work in ADHOC region and one sensor operates in GSM network acting as a gateway between all the CH's and the base station (BS). The information about the patient's condition will be sent to BS through gateway sensor only if there is an emergency. Even in case of gateway sensor failure any other sensor in the village which is able to communicate with all sensors can act as gateway by switching its operation to cellular network.

But due to the constrained of resources and limited battery supply of sensor nodes, this becomes the major areas of research. Earlier the LEACH protocol proposed contributes a lot in terms of reducing energy consumption among sensor nodes. Later on concept of rendezvous nodes (RZ) and mobile sink was combined with LEACH to reduce energy consumption and to prolong lifetime of network. In order to contribute more toward this direction Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been added to find the optimized route. The proposed work makes use of the concept of Neural Network (in the selection process of cluster heads) and Hybrid ACO/PSO technique (to find the shortest route) has been used in optimizing the network lifetime and to improve energy efficiency.

This paper is mainly focused on TESDA protocol against the compromised nodes that attempt to inject fake data into the data aggregation process. To optimize the data aggregation process in the existence of compromised nodes, the TESDA integrates an energy efficient clustering approach and a trust-based security mechanism. The trust-based security mechanism of TESDA allows the sink and cluster head to estimate a deviation based trust and it diminishes the impact of the compromised sensor node contribution in aggregation performance. By considering the current trust values of sensor nodes in the cluster head election process, the TESDA optimizes the cluster head election performance and also enhances the routing performance By electing a CH based on residual energy, the clustering mechanism of TESDA attains fair energy consumption among nodes within the cluster.

The recorded data will be passed through the network from a sensor to a main location. Sensors life time is based on the battery power. Lower the battery power leads to decrease in lifetime for a sensor. It is important to increase the lifespan of sensors and also to distribute the power over WSN. Energy can be efficiently used up to some level in one of the hierarchy routing protocol that is Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). This paper compares the performance of LEACH, Genetic-LEACH and Inter cluster Communication in LEACH. Here, first analyzed the basic operations involved in LEACH and then it is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to extend the life time of WSN. Finally these results are compared with LEACH which uses inter cluster communication to reach sink instead of direct communication. First set of Simulation results using MATLAB shows that the Genetic LEACH increases the living time of the WSN compared with LEACH, and also second set of results shows that the inter cluster communication in LEACH reduces energy consumption by the nodes significantly and the living period of WSN is increased compared with LEACH and with Genetic LEACH. © 2017 IEEE.","Genetic Algorithm; Genetic-LEACH and Inter cluster Communication; LEACH; Wireless Sensor Network","Clustering algorithms; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Leaching; MATLAB; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Adaptive clustering; Direct communications; Energy efficient; Hierarchy routing; Independent sensors; Intercluster communication; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Physical conditions; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467388542,,,"English","Int.

This provides the computing world as an utility based scenario of sharing the given resources of different data centeres with enormous opportunities. Though replicas of a data file has increased, the performance and availability of data also increases. In this paper the different aspects on dynamic, cost-aware with the data replication method through optimization is proposed which identifies the less amount of information of data replication which is required to make sure that the data availability increases with the increase in the replication process. The multi objective optimization strategy for the cost of replication from higher-cost data centers to lower-cost data centers being implemented by the concept of Improved knapsack algorithm and considering the availability and load balancing in the replication process. Data can be managed effectively by file replication, which reduces effectively the file service time and access latency, which increases the file availability and the system get improved through load balancing. An efficient and improved multi-objective optimized replication management (EIMORM) can solve these optimal solutions by balancing among these optimization objectives.

Probabilistic routing method is designed for MANETs to selects the best path in a network while transmitting the packets and to reduce the average energy per packet. However, in probabilistic routing, the packets which are sent fail to reach the exact destination so it requires rebroadcasting which resulting in higher energy consumption. In order to overcome such limitations, an effective routing mechanism called Deterministic Multicast Link Based Energy Optimized Routing (DML-EOR) is proposed to select the optimized route path for efficient data packet transmission in MANETs. Initially, DML-EOR mechanism performs Deterministic Link Stability Estimation to search possible stable routes from the source to destination in order to enhance the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and to reduce the average End to End Delay (EED). After that, DML-EOR mechanism computes Link Reliability criterion to select optimized route path among all available paths with minimum residual energy. Finally, DML-EOR mechanism performs effective data transmission through the selected optimized route path which results in improved Network Lifetime (NL) and minimum Energy Consumption (EC). The performance of DML-EOR mechanism is measured in terms of Energy utilization (EU), NL, PDR and average EED. The simulations result shows that the DML-EOR mechanism is able to improve the PDR by 9% and also reduces the EC of routing process by 30% when compared to state-of-the-art-works. © 2017 IEEE.","Deterministic Link Stability Estimation; Link Reliability; Mobile Ad Hoc Networks; optimized route path; residual energy; stable routes","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Multicasting; Network routing; Oil well flooding; Link reliability; Link stability; optimized route path; Residual energy; Stable routes; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

This paper proposes a ubiquitous solution to activity recognition through the use of tri-axial accelerometers of smartphones. Use of smartphones for activity recognition poses new challenges such as variation in hardware configuration and usage behavior like where the smartphone is kept. Only a few works address one or more of these challenges. Consequently, in this paper we present an activity recognition framework for identifying both static and dynamic activities addressing above mentioned challenges in order to make the framework ubiquitous. Since accelerometer is widely available in many smartphone configurations, activities are detected based on accelerometer readings only. The framework forms a two-phase classifier to address the variance due to different hardware configuration and usage behavior in terms of where the smartphone is kept (pant pocket, shirt pocket or bag). The framework is implemented and tested on real data set collected from 10 users with 6 different device configurations. It is observed that, with our proposed two phase approach, recognition accuracy increases by 9% on an average than single phase approach in energy efficient manner. © 2017 IEEE.","Device independence; Human activity recognition; Position independence; Supervised learning","Accelerometers; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Mobile computing; Pattern recognition; Smartphones; Supervised learning; Device configurations; Device independence; Entertainment application; Hardware configurations; Human activity recognition; Position independence; Recognition accuracy; Triaxial accelerometer; mHealth",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21619646,9781538638392,,,"English","Int.

Cloud computing provides services through virtualization layer, which helps to execute more than one operating systems and applications on a single machine. Being a crucial part of cloud computing, virtualization layer faces major security threats, most challenging being an insider threat wherein attacker can either compromise existing virtual machines (VMs) or create rogue VMs. The objective of this work is to propose virtual machine (VM) allocation algorithm which operates in an untrusted cloud computing environment with non-trustworthy VMs. Our approach is based on the notion of trust. Lack of trust is modeled by either introducing faults or monitoring SLAs per host on which VMs are hosted.

However, automatic generation of news comments is a new, challenging and not well-studied task in NLG. Different from other NLG tasks, this task requires the contextual relevance between comments and news. In addition, we need to generate diversified comments, because different people usually have different opinions on the same news in the real world. In this paper, we propose a gated attention neural network model (GANN) to generate news comments. To address the problem of contextual relevance, we introduce the gated attention mechanism to use news context self-Adaptively and selectively. To ensure the diversity of comments, we use random sample and relevance control to generate comments with different topics and degrees of relevance. Moreover, we apply generative adversarial nets to improve GANN. Automatic evaluation with perplexity score reveals that GANN outperforms the existing comment generation methods. Human evaluation proves that the generated news comments are close to human comments. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; natural language generation; natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computational linguistics; Decoding; Gas generators; Logic gates; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Attention mechanisms; Automatic evaluation; Automatic Generation; Computational model; Natural language generation; Neural network model; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Response generation; Recurrent neural networks","Wang, W.; Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: w-w16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035811477

The problem of appropriate security service selection with hesitant fuzzy information is a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper, we introduce a soft hesitant fuzzy rough set (SHFRS) to solve multi-criteria decision making problems. SHFRS is introduced as an innovative extension of the hesitant fuzzy rough set theory by fusing it with the hesitant fuzzy soft set. We describe the inverse hesitant fuzzy soft set that defines the inverse hesitant fuzzy relation to determine the SHFRS upper and lower approximation operators of any hesitant fuzzy subset in the given set of parameters. We also present different special cases of SHFRS upper and lower approximation operators and discuss some fundamental theorems based on approximation operators. In addition, we propose a novel solution to multi-criteria decision making problems based on SHFRS. Finally, we assess the proposed solution by applying it to a real-Time multi-criteria decision making problem of appropriate security service selection for FMEC in the existence of multi-observer hesitant fuzzy information. © 2013 IEEE.","decision making; Fog and mobile-edge computing; hesitant fuzzy set; hesitant fuzzy soft set; rough set","Computation theory; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Fog; Fuzzy sets; Hafnium; Inverse problems; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Set theory; Edge computing; Fuzzy soft sets; Mobile cellular networks; Mobile communications; Mobile user requirements; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Security; Upper and lower approximation; Rough set theory","Park, J.J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and TechnologySouth Korea; email: jhpark1@seoultech.ac.kr",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035812152

The beta-amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain are considered as the main pathological causes. Functional connectivity is typically examined in capturing brain network dynamics in AD. A definitive underconnectivity is observed in patients through the progressive stages of AD. Graph theoretic modeling approaches have been effective in understanding the brain dynamics. In this work, the brain connectivity patterns and the functional topology in default mode network regions through the progression of Alzheimer's disease are analysed using resting state fMRI. The altered network topology analysed by graph theoretical measures explains cognitive deficits caused by the progression of this disease. Results show that the functional topology is disrupted in the default mode network regions as the disease progress in AD patients. Further, it is observed that there is a lack of left lateralization involving default mode network regions as the severity in AD increases. © 2017 IEEE.","Alzhiemer's; default mode network; functional connectivity; graph theory","Computation theory; Graph theory; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Alzhiemer's; Cognitive deficits; Default-mode networks; Functional connectivity; Graph theoretic modeling; Graph theoretical measures; Resting-state fmri; Topology",,"Wang Y.Hamdy F.Howard N.Zadeh L.A.Hussain A.Widrow B.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538607701,,,"English","Proc.

In our proposed work, energy efficient concentric circular clustering protocol(EECCCP), the energy heterogeneity normal and the super nodes having flat topology while the advance nodes having clustering topology, are deployed in different zones of concentric circular network field. A hybrid communication with energy heterogeneity increases the network lifetime. The protocol considers the average energy of the network and residual energy of the nodes to select the cluster-heads. Since the network field is circular with the base station at the center and the nodes with same energy are deployed at equal distance from the base station, this topology increases the network life time and stability of the network.

Each node of this network consists of low capacity battery. Because of heterogeneous characteristic of the topology, network parameters are imprecise in nature. This, in effect, the performance and lifetime of the network degrade. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an optimized energy efficient routing (OE2R) method. This method is inspired by artificial intelligence techniques such as multiobjective optimization, geometric programming, aspiration level, and tolerance limit. The fusion of such stated artificial intelligence techniques provide an effective tool to optimize multiple conflict objectives and estimate imprecise parameters of the network, simultaneously. The proposed technique OE2R is simulated using LINGO optimization software. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, its performance is compared with some existing methods such as approximate linear programming technique for average cost bounds and linear programming-based efficient message delivery approach in hybrid network in several passes of performance metrics. The simulation results show that the proposed OE2R method performs much better with the comparative methods and may be implemented as energy-efficient routing for HANET.

With the evolvement of latest global web technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), Device-to-Device and Machine-to-Machine communication has opened new doors for Wireless Sensor Network applications. Heterogeneity in terms of energy in the devices independent or embedded is an inherent property of WSNs for internet-of-things. Dissimilar energy consumption of sensor nodes has become a crucial factor for the designing and development of clustering protocols. Stability period and network lifetime are the basic parameters for the realization of network from energy balancing point of view. Scalability in the network with variant number of nodes as well as different values of energies has allowed analysis of stability period, network lifetime and also sub-periods of lifetime for better connectivity, coverage and efficient communication in the above mentioned web applications. Periodic assessment of sub periods of lifetime for event based dynamic monitoring of the objects in internet-of-things will prove advantageous in the coming decades. A protocol based on broad and crossover transmission distance for heterogeneous wireless sensor network system is proposed here. This approach of Heterogeneous Broad Transmission Distance Protocol (HT-BTDP) with scalability is put forward for field-specific as well as event based applications of WSNs in IoT.

Our envisioned system calls for monitoring devices, capable of timely recognition of thermal sensation variations to minimize user discomfort. Respiration, one of the major contributors in heat dissipation of the human body, can be non-intrusively measured by Doppler radar sensors. Thus, the question in this study was whether the application of Doppler radar sensors is qualified and sufficiently sensitive for the envisioned system integration. We have presented a conceptual framework for system integration using Doppler radar sensors as well as an experimental study for addressing the research question by quantifying respiration in a test bed with gradual temperature changes from low to high. The results showed an increasing trend in the respiration state for three subjects out of four, and it was observed that respiration increased in higher temperatures for all the subjects.

Waze data and people-centric methods facilitate the analysis and help improve our understanding of realistic transportation system behavior in response to a disruptive event (i.e., accidents and traffic jams). Using the proposed approach, the resilience has been quantified for selected highway sections in Washington, DC area by using reports of delays, caused by disruptive events. The changes in travel time were used as the base for resilience quantification. The accident and traffic jam reports were collected and used as the performance indicators of the model.

While customers would prefer a higher incentive to participate, utilities would prefer to minimize the incentive while achieving a target reduction. Because the incentive affects the bottomline of the utility, identifying the optimal incentive reflecting this trade-off is important. Several works have focused on how to implement DR in a building, but there has been little work on identifying the optimal incentive from the utility’s perspective. We complement existing work with an approach on how a utility can identify the optimal incentive for a set of buildings that it serves, while meeting individual buildings’ constraints. To this end, we build Demand-Response Potential (DRP) models that give the economically rational demand reduction of a building as a function of the utility’s offered incentive. For handling scalability at the utility level, we approximate the DRP using regression based approach. We evaluate our approach on the PLUTO dataset of building types and sizes. We find that the DRP varies with building types (from 19% for restaurants to 54% for warehouses). It is typically low for buildings with high thermal inertia; and building types with low individual DRP can contribute significantly in aggregate due to their numbers. Offering non-uniform incentives to different buildings can improve the utility’s DR benefit by up to 19% compared to offering uniform incentives. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Demand response; Energy; HVAC; Incentive design; Optimization","Buildings; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Rational functions; Building types; Demand reduction; Demand response; Electrical utilities; Energy; HVAC; Incentive design; Optimal incentives; Structural design","Vasan, A.; TCS Innovation Labs, Tata Consultancy Services IIT-Madras Research ParkIndia; email: arun.vasan@tcs.com","Eskicioglu R.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450354769,,,"English","BuildSys - Proc.

However, many studies have shown that changing user behavior from an energy standpoint is a very difficult problem. Furthermore, in countries such as the United States, users do not have sufficient monetary incentives to become energy conscious, given the low cost of electricity, and more generally, energy. In this paper, we study this issue in a developing economy and present a user study of 41 apartments in a high-rise apartment complex in India. Through a combination of fine-grain energy meter usage data and detailed user surveys, we find that these users may be no more energy conscious or motivated to adopt energy efficiency measures than their counterparts in Western nations. Our study challenges the belief that energy prices are higher in developing regions and hence, users in developing regions tend to be more energy-aware than those elsewhere. Consequently, and importantly, we argue that utility companies, rather than end-users, should be the vanguard for realizing energy efficiency improvement at consumer premises in order to obtain grid-wide benefits such as peak load reduction or avoiding blackouts. Towards this goal, we argue for a sustained research effort into utility-scale energy analytic approaches, for example, to identify end users who are large consumers along with the underlying causes of their consumption. Utilities can deploy such approaches and then aggressively target these users for energy efficiency improvements. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Energy awareness programs; User Behavior and Incentives","Apartment houses; Behavioral research; Economics; Efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management; Apartment complexes; Developing economies; Developing regions; Energy awareness; Energy efficiency improvements; Peak load reductions; Reduce energy consumption; User behaviors; Energy efficiency",,"Eskicioglu R.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450354769,,,"English","BuildSys - Proc.

Manufacturers are looking for a self-contained solution. This is because their products are deployed in a large number of different buildings, and it is neither feasible for a vendor to negotiate with each building to use the building’s network (e.g., WiFi) nor practical to establish its own network infrastructure. The vendor can rent a dedicated channel from an ISP to act as a thing-to-cloud communication (TCC) link for each of its IoT devices. The readily available choices, e.g., 3G is over costly for most IoT devices. ISPs are developing cheaper choices for TCC links, yet we expect that the number of choices for TCC links will be small as compared to hundreds or thousands of requirements on different costs and data rates from IoT applications. We address this issue by proposing a communication sharing architecture sTube+, sharing tube. The objective of sTube+ is to organize a greater number of IoT devices, with heterogeneous data communication and cost requirements to efficiently share fewer choices of TCC links, and transmit their data to the cloud. We take a design of centralized price optimization and distributed network control. More specifically, we architect a layered architecture for data delivery, develop algorithms to optimize the overall monetary cost, and prototype a fully functioning system of sTube+. We evaluate sTube+ by both experiments and simulations. In addition, we develop a case study on smart maintenance of chillers and pumps, using sTube+ as the underlying network architecture. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Communication architecture; IoT; Smart building; Thing-to-cloud","Buildings; Costs; Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Maintenance; Manufacture; Network architecture; Wi-Fi; Cloud communications; Communication architectures; Dedicated channels; Distributed network control; Heterogeneous data; Layered architecture; Network infrastructure; Sharing architectures; Computer architecture",,"Eskicioglu R.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450354769,,,"English","BuildSys - Proc.

We allow for imperfect communication links, where information packets may be lost due to noise and collisions. The packets that are received correctly are used to estimate the objects' trajectories by employing an extended Kalman Filter, where provisions are made to accommodate a randomly changing number of obseravtions in each iteration. An adaptive rate control scheme is additionally applied to instruct the sensor nodes on how to adjust their transmission rate so as to improve the location estimation accuracy and the energy efficiency of the system. By focusing explicitly on the objects' locations, rather than working with a pre-specified grid of potential locations, we resolve the spatial quantization issues associated with sparse identification methods. Finally, we extend the method to address the possibility of objects entering and departing the observation area, thus improving the scalability of the system and relaxing the requirement for accurate knowledge of the objects' initial locations.

Due to multiple node failures, network topology may change or partition into many disconnected segments causing data/query path breakage. Early detection and recovery of faults is desirable in most scenarios. Also, due to limited battery life of a node, the solution must consume minimum possible energy for prolonged network operation. Hence in this paper, we propose a Fault Detection and Recovery scheme which is an energy efficient fault detection and recovery strategy that achieves minimum data loss by efficiently replacing faulty node on the present route or by finding full or partial alternate paths. Topology is managed by constructing a virtual grid over the entire network which helps in managing dynamically changing network topology easily and makes failure detection and recovery effective. It also helps to create energy efficient path between a source and a sink by finding shortest possible path. Further, nodes’ cooperation is exploited to create certain zones on the data/query path which provides alternate nodes or possible alternate paths if required on some node failures. Thus, scheme achieves fault tolerance and at the same time achieves energy efficiency by always selecting shortest path for data delivery between source and sink.

The most widely accepted method to preserve energy of sensor nodes is clustering. In cluster based networks, energy consumption is higher in the nodes which are closer to the sink as compared to the nodes which are located farther away from base station (BS). Various unequal clustering algorithms were proposed in the past to correct this issue. The major drawbacks in the findings are that the nodes, which join a specific cluster head, cause overburdening of the cluster head. In this paper, we present an algorithm namely energy efficient unequal sector clustering (EUSC) using multi-sector and unequal clustering approaches which improve the network’s energy efficiency. EUSC divides the network into multiple sectors based on nodes distances from BS. Selection of cluster heads in each sector is based on nodes distances to BS, residual energy and neighbor nodes proximities in that sector. Selection of a relay cluster head for data transmission is also based on residual energy, nodes distances to BS and queue length of nodes. In this paper, we have carried out some theoretical analysis of the nodes energy consumption in each sector and derived an expression for optimal number of clusters in each sector to minimize nodes energy consumption. Various simulations were carried out with MATLAB package to differentiate the competency of the proposed EUSC algorithm with that of the existing protocols ECHA and ‘PSO based protocol’. Simulation results in different network scenarios indicate that EUSC has given much improved performance than ECHA and ‘PSO based protocol’ in terms of number of clusters formed during each round, network lifetime and energy efficiency. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Energy consumption; Sector; Unequal clusters; Wireless sensor networks","Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based networks; Energy efficient; Energy minimization; Number of clusters; Sector; Unequal clustering; Unequal clusters; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes","Sundaran, K.; School of Computing, SRM UniversityIndia; email: karthika.su@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032939072

Sparse Representation (SR) is a powerful signal processing theory used in wide variety of applications like image denoising, compression and fusion. Construction of a proper dictionary with reduced computational efficiency is a major challenge in these applications. Owing to the above criterion, we propose a supervised dictionary learning approach for the fusion algorithm. Initially, gradient information is obtained for each patch of the training data set. Then, the edge strength and information content are measured for the gradient patches. A selection rule is finally employed to select the patches with better focus features for training the over complete dictionary. By the above process, the number of input patches for dictionary training is reduced to a greater extent. At the fusion step, the globally learned dictionary is used to represent the given set of source image patches.

The AHP method is enforced to configure the structure of cloud service selection problem and to impel the criteria weight using the pairwise comparisons, and the TOPSIS method utilizes the final ranking of the solution. In our proposed model, the non-functional quality of service requirements is taken into consideration for selecting appropriate service. Furthermore, the proposed model exploits a set of pre-defined linguistic variables, parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers for evaluating each criteria weights.

There are many ICI cancellation techniques available in the literature, such as self-cancellation (SC), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and windowing, but they present a tradeoff between bandwidth redundancy and system complexity. In this study, a new energy-efficient, bandwidth-effective technique is proposed to mitigate ICI through cyclic prefix (CP) reuse at the receiver end. Unlike SC and MLE where the whole OFDM symbol data is transmitted in duplicate to create redundancy at the transmitter end, the proposed technique uses the CP data (which is only 20% of the total symbol bandwidth) to estimate the channel, and it produces similar results with a huge bandwidth saving. The simulation results show that the proposed technique has a significant improvement in error performance, and a comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial improvement in energy efficiency with high bandwidth gain.

Due to the existence of negative relations, many nodes are suspicious of masquerading and conspiring against popular nodes as well as intruding into the private groups of networks.

While the existing literature focused only on small offline datasets, in this work an approach to identify negative nodes in large datasets of OSNs is proposed. The deviation of results of measures from actual behavior is examined using statistical and graphical techniques. It was observed that PN centrality measure is able to detect a number of outsiders of the network with higher accuracy as compared to other measures. However, some crucial nodes which are actually outsiders are misclassified as the most popular nodes by it.

Recent technological advances in wireless networking, IC fabrication and sensor technology have lead to the emergence of millimetre scale devices that collectively form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and are radically changing the way in which we sense, process and transport signals of interest. They are increasingly become viable solutions to many challenging problems and will successively be deployed in many areas in the future such as in environmental monitoring, business, and military applications. However, deploying new technology, without security in mind has often proved to be unreasonably dangerous. This also applies to WSNs, especially those used in applications that monitor sensitive information (e.g., health care applications). There have been significant contributions to overcome many weaknesses in sensor networks like coverage problems, lack in power and making best use of limited network bandwidth, however; work in sensor network security is still in its infancy stage. Security in WSNs presents several well-known challenges stemming from all kinds of resource constraints of individual sensors. The problem of securing these networks emerges more and more as a hot topic. Symmetric key cryptography is commonly seen as infeasible and public key cryptography has its own key distribution problem. In contrast to this prejudice, this paper presents a new symmetric encryption standard algorithm which is an extension of the previous work of the authors i.e. UES version-II and III. Roy et al recently developed few efficient encryption methods such as UES version-I, Modified UES-I, UES version-II, UES version-III. The algorithm is named as Ultra Encryption Standard version - IV algorithm.

Education organization begin to leverage solutions like cloud computing and radio frequency identification (RFID) across an IoT platform.

Student daily activity datasets are formed based on sensing capabilities of IoT nodes. Smart computing integrates hardware, software, and network technologies that provides systems with real-time situation awareness and automated analysis. The engineering student performance per session is calculated by combining the results from sensory nodes based education data mining algorithms and student academic datasets. Moreover, based on student sessional performance score, decisions are taken by management authority to increase the reputation score of the engineering institution. The experiment comprises two sections. In first section, RFID based experimental setup is defined with objects interaction patterns. In second section, student performance score generated using proposed system is compared with manual system.

Achieving reliability in data transmission in WSN is a big challenge. Forward error control (FEC) and Automatic Repeat request (ARQ) are the error control mechanisms used for increasing the reliability of data transmission. Since, WSN is a power constraint environment, the error control mechanism implemented in the sensor nodes should consume less energy. In this paper, we propose optimal quasi cyclic FEC scheme in WSN for detection and correction of burst errors. In ARQ, retransmission of corrupted data is highly time consuming whereas the proposed quasi cyclic code handles the burst errors effectively, which are very common in bulk data transmission. Quasi cyclic codes are known for their minimum distances among linear codes. In the proposed work, optimal binary quasi cyclic code is adopted for the first time for error correction in WSN with column wise transmission. The inference is that quasi cyclic FEC is effective in terms of energy efficiency compared to other FEC codes and ARQ schemes. It also improves the network lifetime by reducing the retransmission. © 2017 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Energy efficiency; Forward error correction; Quasi cyclic codes",,"Kaythry, P.; Department of Electronics and Communication, SSN College of EngineeringIndia; email: kaythryp@ssn.edu.in",,"Natural Sciences Publishing USA",19350090,,,,"English","Appl.

In order to establish a dynamic session secret amongst a group of sensor nodes in a WSN, group-key broadcast is found to be a workable solution. However, when a node misses one or more group-key broadcast messages, rebroadcasting results in additional energy consumption at node end and increased network traffic as well. Self-healing mechanism is, therefore, used to recover the lost broadcasts using a future session broadcast. A node, that has missed multiple consecutive broadcasts and does not want to wait for a future broadcast, can obtain the session key through mutual-healing with the help of a neighbor node. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient mutual-healing protocol that uses Chinese remainder theorem(CRT) based secret sharing for group key broadcast. During mutual-healing, mutual authentication and key confirmation are provided. The probability of an unauthorized member retrieving a past session key through self-healing or responding to a mutual-healing request as a neighbor node is shown negligible. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol provides significant performance improvement in terms of computation, communication and storage overhead as compared to existing mutual-healing protocols. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Authentication; Chinese remainder theorem; Mutual-healing; Wireless sensor networks","Authentication; Computation theory; Cryptography; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Broadcast messages; Chinese remainder theorem; Dynamic sessions; Group key distribution protocols; Key confirmation; Mutual authentication; Mutual-healing; Self healing mechanism; Wireless sensor networks","Agrawal, S.Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India; email: sarita_agrawal@daiict.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",01403664,,COCOD,,"English","Comput Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031307985

We propose Optimized Discharge-Curve-based Coverage Protocol (ODCP) to handle these problems. ODCP determines optimal sleep schedules for redundant nodes using their neighboring active nodes’ battery discharge rate, failure probability, and coverage overlap information. ODCP is simulated extensively using various scenarios of WSNs. The simulation results show that ODCP provides energy-efficient coverage as compared to other existing coverage protocols. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Backoff sleep time; Bathtub curve; Battery discharge curve; Coverage redundancy; Failure probability; Optimal coverage","Curve fitting; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Bathtub curve; Battery discharge curves; Failure Probability; Optimal coverage; Sleep time; Sensor nodes","More, A.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, MPSTME, NMIMS UniversityIndia; email: avinash.more@nmims.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",00457906,,CPEEB,,"English","Comput Electr Eng",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009351799

When multiple routes are possible, most routing protocols for CRNs use some metric—independent of the traffic class—to select routes. However, a route that works well for transferring a particular class of data may not be the right one for a different data class, as its quality of service (QoS) requirements may differ. In this paper, we propose a reactive energy efficient routing protocol with differentiated services (REEDS) for cognitive radio networks. Route selection in REEDS is based on different (multiple) hop metrics calculated dynamically for different traffic classes so that a minimum level of QoS is guaranteed. Another characteristic feature of REEDS is the prediction and dodging of nodes that may be excessively loaded with traffic. This results in the avoidance of formation of holes due to heavy energy expenditure by some nodes. Simulation shows that routes in REEDS are established so that the QoS requirements of each traffic class are satisfied and lesser energy is consumed compared to other routing protocols for CRNs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cognitive radio; Energy; QoS; Routing","Cognitive radio; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Transportation routes; Cognitive radio Ad-Hoc networks; Cognitive radio network; Differentiated Services; Energy; Energy efficient routing protocol; Qos differentiations; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Routing; Quality of service","Chilukuri, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, GVP College of Engineering(A)India; email: shanti06@cse.iitb.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021217652

To achieve the best possible performance within limited power budgets, the various system resources need to be allocated effectively. Any mismatch between runtime resource requirement and allocation leads to a sub-optimal energy-delay product (EDP). Different optimization techniques exist for addressing the problem of mismatch between the dynamic requirement and runtime allocation of the system resources. Choosing between multiple optimizations at runtime is complex due to the non-additive effects, making the scenario suitable for the application of machine learning techniques. We present a novel method,Machine LearnedMachines (MLM), by using online reinforcement learning (RL) to perform dynamic partitioning of the last level cache (LLC), along with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) of the core and uncore (interconnection network and LLC). We have proposed and evaluated three different MLM co-optimization techniques based on independent and cooperative multi-agent learners. We show that the co-optimization results in a much lower system EDP than any of the techniques applied individually. We explore various RL models targeted toward optimization of different system metrics and study their effects on a system EDP, system throughput (STP), and Fairness. The various proposed techniques have been extensively evaluated with a mix of 20 workloads on a 4-core system using Spec2006 benchmarks.We have further evaluated our cooperative MLM techniques on a 16-core system. The results show an average of 20.5% and 19.1% system EDP improvement on a 4-core and 16-core system, respectively, with limited degradation of STP and Fairness. © 2017 ACM.","And frequency scaling; Cache management; Computer architectures; Dynamic voltage; Energy efficient computation; Low power architectures","Budget control; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy efficiency; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Learning systems; Memory architecture; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Outsourcing; Reinforcement learning; Voltage scaling; Cache management; Dynamic voltage; Energy efficient; Frequency-scaling; Low power architecture; Computer architecture",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15443566,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

In this context, irregular programs with task-parallel loops present interesting challenges: The threads with lesser work-loads (noncritical- threads) wait at the join-points for the thread with maximum work-load (critical-thread); this leads to significant energy wastage. This problem becomes more interesting in the context of multi-socket-multi-core (MSMC) systems, where different sockets may run at different frequencies, but all the cores connected to a socket run at a single frequency. In such a configuration, even though the load-imbalance among the cores may be significant, an MSMC-oblivious technique may miss the opportunities to reduce energy consumption, if the load-imbalance across the sockets is minimal. This problem becomes further challenging in the presence of mutual-exclusion, where scaling the frequencies of a socket executing the non-critical-threads can impact the execution time of the critical-threads. In this article, we propose a scheme (X10Ergy) to obtain energy gains with minimal impact on the execution time, for task-parallel languages, such as X10, HJ, and so on. X10Ergy takes as input a loop-chunked program (parallel-loop iterations divided into chunks and each chunk is executed by a unique thread). X10Ergy follows a mixed compile-time + runtime approach that (i) uses static analysis to efficiently compute the work-load of each chunk at runtime, (ii) computes the ""remaining"" work-load of the chunks running on the cores of each socket at regular intervals and tunes the frequency of the sockets accordingly, (iii) groups the threads into different sockets (based on the remaining work-load of their respective chunks), and (iv) in the presence of atomic-blocks, models the effect of frequency-scaling on the critical-thread.We implemented X10Ergy for X10 and have obtained encouraging results for the IMSuite kernels. © 2017 ACM.","DVFS; Irregular task parallel programs; Multi-socket-multi-core systems","Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Multicore programming; Parallel programming; Static analysis; Different frequency; DVFS; Frequency-scaling; Irregular programs; Multi-core systems; Mutual exclusions; Reduce energy consumption; Task parallel; Energy efficiency",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15443566,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

There is a variant of coverage problem called α-coverage, where a fraction of targets allowed to be left uncovered to provide partial coverage. This variant of coverage is presented by Maximum Network α-Lifetime Problem (α-MLP) that is the special case of classical MLP. During α-coverage, there has been no choice over targets which are going to be left uncovered, instead, a random set of targets are left uncovered. If we can wisely select the set of targets which are going to be left uncovered, then, the network lifetime can be prolonged further. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient heuristic to solve α-MLP. Our heuristic not only supports partial coverage, but, it also put a valuable observation on the targets which are left uncovered.

This paper proposes a logic cluster controllability (LoCCo)-based scan chain stitching methodology to achieve low-power testing. The scan chain stitching is made power aware by placing flip-flops with higher test combination requirements at the beginning of scan chains, while flip-flops with lower test combination requirements are put toward the end of scan chains. The test combination requirements are estimated through a simple logic cluster and flip-flop controllability identification algorithm. This method helps in consolidating care bits toward the beginning of scan chains. Hence, a significantly lower shift-in transition is achieved in the test patterns. The results from ITC'99 and industrial designs in 28FDSOI and 40-nm CMOS technologies show a total shift-in transition reduction of up to 23.1% and average shift power reduction of up to 21.6% using the proposed method. The use of LoCCo methodology posed a negligible routing congestion overhead in the layout compared to the conventional method. LoCCo is also used as a base to apply other vector reordering low-power methods and gain 3.5× reduced computation time with almost similar power reduction as achieved by Bonhomme et al. independently. © 2017 IEEE.","Care bits; controllability; Design for testabilit (DFT); logic cluster; low-power testing; scan chain","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Controllability; Design for testability; Flip flop circuits; Integrated circuit testing; Power management; Reduction; System-on-chip; Computation time; Conventional methods; Identification algorithms; logic cluster; Low power testing; Power reductions; Routing congestion; Scan chain; Chains","Pathak, S.; STMicroelectronics Pvt.

Normally, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network gets fragmented. To mitigate this issue, we propose a three phase energy balanced zone based routing protocol. Specifically, in the first phase the region is physically divided into equi-sized zones. In the second phase, a node with minimum traffic and minimum distance from other nodes inside each zone is selected as the zone leader. This leader is responsible for delivering data generated by any node in that zone and for routing and forwarding the data received from other zone leaders of the neighbor zones. In the third phase, zones are categorized as non-congested, medium-congested and congested zones and route path is established in inter and intra zones. The novelty of the proposed protocol lies behind the idea of incorporating the zone congestion levels along with the hop count into the routing decisions. A congestion control mechanism is proposed both at inter and intra zone levels in order to relieve the congested areas in case of congestion occurrence. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol has the potential to achieve up to 10.5% enhancement in the network throughput, 19.5% energy saving when compared with grid-based multi-path GMCAR with congestion avoidance and 23.03% energy saving when compared with priority-based application-specific congestion control clustering protocol PASCC. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Congestion control; Energy efficient; Gradient value; Wireless Sensor Networks; Zone based routing","Congestion control (communication); Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Application specific; Clustering protocol; Congestion avoidance; Congestion control mechanism; Energy efficient; Experimental evaluation; Performance degradation; Zone-based; Wireless sensor networks","Sunitha, G.P.; Dept. of ISE, Jawaharlal Nehru National College Of EngineeringIndia; email: sunithagp17@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023172078

However, recent advances in multimedia technology have led to the availability of a wide range of sensors with widely varying capabilities. The introduction of multimedia sensors has presented additional challenges such as requirement of application-specific quality of service (QoS), high bandwidth and low delay. This paper presents an enhanced ant-based QoS-aware routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (EAQHSeN). It is a differentiated service-based QoS routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with multimedia and scalar nodes. We have used bio-inspired routing heuristics, and the key feature of the protocol is its ability to meet diverse QoS requirements claimed by heterogeneous traffic generated by the nodes. The routing decision is taken independently for control traffic, scalar traffic and multimedia traffic, thus maximizing the network performance and utilization. Simulation results show that the proposed EAQHSeN protocol performs better than the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol and energy-efficient ant-based routing (EEABR) protocol. The average percentage improvement in minimum residual energy by EAQHSeN over EEABR is approximately 4 % which is an indication of extended lifetime. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ant routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor network; Heuristic function; Multimedia packets; QoS routing; Scalar packets","Energy efficiency; Heuristic algorithms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routers; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Ant routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Heuristic functions; Multimedia packets; QoS routing; Scalar packets; Sensor nodes","Woungang, I.; Department of Computer Science, Ryerson UniversityCanada; email: iwoungan@scs.ryerson.ca",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987608817

We consider circuits that are restricted in the ways in which they can compute monomials: this can be seen as restricting the families of parse trees that appear in the circuit. Such restrictions capture essentially all non-commutative circuit models for which lower bounds are known. We prove several results about such circuits. 1. We show explicit exponential lower bounds for circuits with up to an exponential number of parse trees, strengthening the work of Lagarde, Malod, and Perifel (ECCC 2016), who prove such a result for Unique Parse Tree (UPT) circuits which have a single parse tree. 2. We show explicit exponential lower bounds for circuits whose parse trees are rotations of a single tree. This simultaneously generalizes recent lower bounds of Limaye, Malod, and Srinivasan (Theory of Computing 2016) and the above lower bounds of Lagarde et al., which are known to be incomparable. 3. We make progress on a question of Nisan (STOC 1991) regarding separating the power of Algebraic Branching Programs (ABPs) and Formulas in the non-commutative setting by showing a tight lower bound of n(log d) for any UPT formula computing the product of d n × n matrices. When d ≤ log n, we can also prove superpolynomial lower bounds for formulas with up to 2o(d) many parse trees (for computing the same polynomial). Improving this bound to allow for 2O(d) trees would yield an unconditional separation between ABPs and Formulas. 4. We give deterministic white-box PIT algorithms for UPT circuits over any field (strengthening a result of Lagarde et al. (2016)) and also for sums of a constant number of UPT circuits with different parse trees. © Guillaume Lagarde, Nutan Limaye, and Srikanth Srinivasan; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY.","Non-commutative Arithemetic circuits; Partial derivatives; Restrictions","Computation theory; Timing circuits; Algebraic branching programs; Arithmetic circuit; Circuit models; Exponential numbers; Non-commutative; Partial derivatives; Polynomial rings; Restrictions; Forestry",,"Larsen K.G.Raskin J.-F.Bodlaender H.L.","Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9783959770460,,,"English","Leibniz Int.

We abstract this problem into a study of eigenvalues of a perturbed Laplacian matrix. We show that this eigenvalue problem has a complete solution for arbitrarily large control by showing that the best and the worst places to apply control have well-known characterization in graph theory, thus linking the computational eigenvalue problem with graph-theoretical concepts. Some partial results are proved in the case when the control effort is bounded. In particular, we show that a local maximum in localizing the best place for control is also a global maximum. We conjecture in the bounded control case that the best place to apply control must also necessarily be a characteristic vertex and present evidence from numerical experiments to support this conjecture. © 2013 IEEE.","Control systems; graph theory; nonlinear dynamical systems","Computation theory; Control systems; Dynamical systems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Forestry; Matrix algebra; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Bounded controls; Complete solutions; Control effort; Eigenvalue problem; Global maximum; Laplacian matrices; Numerical experiments; Partial results; Graph theory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21682216,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The non-commutative rank of B is the minimum r € N such that there exists U &lt; Fn satisfying dim(U) - dim(B(U)) n - r, where B(U) := span(Ui2€[m]Bi (U)). Computing the non-commutative rank generalizes some well-known problems including the bipartite graph maximum matching problem and the linear matroid intersection problem. In this paper we give a deterministic polynomial-Time algorithm to compute the non-commutative rank over any field F. Prior to our work, such an algorithm was only known over the rational number field Q, a result due to Garg et al, [20]. Our algorithm is constructive and produces a witness certifying the non-commutative rank, a feature that is missing in the algorithm from [20]. Our result is built on techniques which we developed in a previous paper [24], with a new reduction procedure that helps to keep the blow-up parameter small. There are two ways to realize this reduction. The first involves constructivizing a key result of Derksen and Makam [12] which they developed in order to prove that the null cone of matrix semi-invariants is cut out by generators whose degree is polynomial in the size of the matrices involved. We also give a second, simpler method to achieve this. This gives another proof of the polynomial upper bound on the degree of the generators cutting out the null cone of matrix semi-invariants. Both the invariant-Theoretic result and the algorithmic result rely crucially on the regularity lemma proved in [24]. In this paper we improve on the constructive version of the regularity lemma from [24] by removing a technical coprime condition that was assumed there.","invariant theory; non-commutative rank; null cone; semi-invariants of quivers; symbolic determinant identity testing","Computation theory; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Identity testing; Invariant theory; Matroid intersection; Maximum matchings; Non-commutative; Polynomial-time algorithms; Rational numbers; semi-invariants of quivers; Matrix algebra",,"Papadimitriou C.H.","Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9783959770293,,,"English","Leibniz Int.

The advantages of simple hysteresis controller, viz. simple implementation and fast dynamic response are added with the advantages of constant switching frequency and reduction in Te(p-p) in the proposed controller. Elimination of look up tables is possible since boundary computation is performed online with estimated stator voltages calculated using current errors along the orthogonal axes thus making implementation easier. The voltage vector to be switched in the next sampling interval is identified by the boundary computed in the present sampling interval. The vector selection logic is designed to extract the features of VC-SVPWM based VSI fed IM drive whereby reduced Te(p-p) at higher modulation indices are obtained. A comparative simulation study of the Current Error Space Vector based controller resembling the characteristics of conventional VC-SVPWM based drive with the proposed controller based drive has been conducted using SIMULINK toolbox of MATLAB for steady state as well as transient performance analysis.

Session key establishment between the sensor node and the user is also required for secure communication. In this paper, we perform the security analysis of A.K.Das's user authentication scheme (given in 2015), Choi et al.'s scheme (given in 2016), and Park et al.'s scheme (given in 2016). The security analysis shows that their schemes are vulnerable to various attacks like user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack and attacks based on legitimate users. Based on the cryptanalysis of these existing protocols, we propose a secure and efficient authenticated session key establishment protocol which ensures various security features and overcomes the drawbacks of existing protocols. The formal and informal security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol withstands the various security vulnerabilities involved in WSNs. The automated validation using AVISPA and Scyther tool ensures the absence of security attacks in our scheme. The logical verification using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic confirms the correctness of the proposed protocol. Finally, the comparative analysis based on computational overhead and security features of other existing protocol indicate that the proposed user authentication system is secure and efficient.

But it is the demand of time to adore power saving rather performance for the sustainable and green earth. As the explosive and exponential growth of the internet device results in the stupendous consumption of power, e.g. switches and routers collectively consume more than 70 percent share of overall power consumed. Switches alone consume beyond 50 percent and spontaneously acclaim more potential to be greenish. As I have calculated and also vindicated by hardware companies that the ports are the critical one among four categorized sections of multilayered switches that consumes more than 40 percent exhibiting only two states: Active and Idle. With the perspective to optimize, I propose a mathematical model with two add-on states: Standby and Sleep to resolve and optimize using proxy port by sensing the traffic in the network.

To protect the generator against power system abnormilities or fault within itself, it needs quick isolation from rest of the system for maintaining stability in power system. As generators are associated to more harmful operating conditions than any other equipment of power system, therefore sensitive as well as selective protection schemes are required. However finalization of a protection scheme requires throughout knowldge of of protection philosophy of machine as well as associated equipments. As the pace of technological change has rapidly accelerated so, In today's scenarios electromechanical type of relays are absolute which were used for each individual protection and instad of that a single multifunction digital/numrical relay with various features are used as a complete generator protection package. One of the major advantage of these relays are that these are working in a common protocol (IEC61850) irrespective of its make (SIEMENS, ABB, AREVA) and facilatate the logics blocks as per the requirement of end user. These relays are used input analoge signals from neutral side of CTs and Phase side CTs and Vts for various computations and algorithms and accepts user configurable inputs and outputs, substation control system interfaces disturbance recording, etc. In this project we are considering different protection schemes of generator and simulate each function using Matlab simulink.

This unique characteristic attracted many promising applications and the one among is battlefield communication. The war troops at the edge of the network do not have any computing infrastructure for communication. Therefore MANET plays a vital role in battlefield communication. Since MANET is openness to eavesdropping, routing of information causes vulnerabilities and degrades the performance of network. This necessitated developing a MANET with a novel intrusion detection system to provide reliability and security to the battlefield communication. This paper proposes a Di-Fuzzy logic technique which provides two phase detection for intrusion detection in the network. It works in a cluster based routing environment to co-ordinate and control the entire network. The selection of cluster head is based on the node with the maximum energy to improve the life time of the network. The proposed technique is simulated in network simulator NS 2.8 and the performance is evaluated by comparing with the existing Fuzzy based IDS (F-IDS) & intrusion detection and adaptive response (IDAR) system. From comparison the proposed Di-Fuzzy logic technique improves its performance in all metrics and thus provides a safe environment for battlefield communication. © 2017 IEEE.","Battlefield communication; Cluster based routing; Fuzzy logic technique; Intrusion Detection; MANET","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Network routing; Network security; Wireless ad hoc networks; Adaptive response; Battlefield communications; Cluster-based; Cluster-based routing; Computing infrastructures; Fuzzy logic techniques; Intrusion Detection Systems; MANET; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059058,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Where pilot contamination and inter-cell interference have been considered as basic limiting factors to achieve high data rate. These parameters will saturate the SE and truncate to a constant value. In this work, we explore the effective evaluation of SE and EE of the M-MIMO antenna system with optimal users. In this work, we basically considered linear processing algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio combing (MRC) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) for the analysis SE for the both single and multi-cell scenario in M-MIMO systems. In this paper, we provide a platform to improve the SE and EE with a variation of base station (BS) antennas M and pilot reuse factor λ. We also derived the explicit and exact expressions for the analysis of SE and EE with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Which are very tight and tractable approximations in the prospective of realistic system scenario. We mainly focused on the asymptotic limit of SE and also obtain optimal user terminals K. It has been noticed that the SE performance greatly depends on the receiving combined scheme. We compared the simulation results for SE based the parameters such as varying antennas at the BS M, optimal UTs K and finally pilot reuse factors λ=4 and λ=7. Here, the simulation results of the BS antennas per-user (M/K) and optimal users K, highly depend on the receive technique and the BS antennas M.

Advances made in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the merging of advanced electronic and wireless technologies. Due to the popularity gained by the wireless environment, Security is the main concern. Node authentication without compromising lifespan of the networks is practically a daunting task. This research work introduces a new model, IBE-ECC that administers the energy of sensor nodes with faster authentication process. Signature verification model is deployed to achieve faster authentication process. Nevertheless, the public key-based strategies eliminate the security process but their verification process takes larger time. Therefore, authentication speed is a major constraint of our research endeavor. The proposed scheme is design to achieve high security and fast authentication with energy efficiency. It uses identity-based encryption on elliptic curve cryptography and a user authentication with an energy efficient key management. Further, to improve the speed of the authentication, it reduces the signature size so that it would accelerate signature verification faster. Hence, the proposed scheme will provide a secure key management, energy efficiency, fast authentication and additionally, computation overhead and communication costs are minimized. Finally, the experimental result demonstrates that the proposed strategy obtains 4797 ms higher execution efficiency and 45. 53% lower computation costs than existing schemes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Identity based encryption; Energy efficient key management; Fast authentication; Wireless sensor network","Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Network security; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Public key cryptography; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authentication scheme; Computation overheads; Elliptic curve cryptography; Identity Based Encryption; Key management; Signature verification; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless technologies; Authentication","Sogani, A.; The IIS University, Mansarovar, India; email: ayushsogani.2006@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032201970

A LEACH-1R that transforms the LEACH by making use of first clustering round & performing the inter-cluster choosing of new CHs (cluster head) rather than aggregated reclustering. A MWSN is termed as a set of wireless mobile nodes & base station that generates an ad-hoc network. Such network can be implemented over several kinds of fields, like underground & underwater. Each node is provided with a particular amount of energy & randomized mobilization. As the absorption of energy is considered to be a cardinal aspect, the protocols of Hierarchal type are able to cope up with this issue, as an illustration, LEACH protocol. LEACH-1R is considered to be an extension to LEACH protocol that improvise the lifetime of a network but the protocol also makes use of location of sensors for organization of network. Hence, it is not considered to be much effective in that field where node localization with the mobility is not possible. In this document, we tend to improvise the traditional algorithm for generating a latest protocol that is termed as LEACH-1R Decentralized for enhancing the lifetime of a network with applying the maps. Further, this protocol is put in contrast to the SMAC & TSEEC for the lifetime of network & dissipation of energy by making use of network simulator.

Clustering is either classified as static and dynamic or as equal and unequal. In cluster based routing protocols that employ multi-hop communication, imbalanced energy consumption among the nodes results in hot-spots. Unequal clustering overcomes hot-spots but requires a high overhead and is prone to connectivity issues. To offer guaranteed connectivity and alleviate the hot-spot problem, a zone divisional hierarchical routing protocol has been proposed in this paper. The network is divided into equal sized static rectangular clusters which are assigned to two zones namely near zone and far zone. The zone facing the base station is known as the near zone and rest of the network space makes up the far zone which is further divided into sub-zones. Dual cluster heads approach for sharing the reception, aggregation and forwarding tasks is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol against the existing protocols reveals that the method offers energy-efficient multi-hop communication support, uses negligible overhead, prevents creation of hot-spots, avoids early death of nodes, uses balanced energy consumption across the network and maximizes the network lifetime. © 2016 IEEE.","clustering; hot-spots; multi-hop; network lifetime","Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Balanced energy consumption; Cluster based routing protocols; clustering; Communication bandwidth; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hot spot; Multihop; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks",,"Tomar G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509011445,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

These nodes are battery powered due to which energy of a node plays a vital role. The amount of the energy used up by any node while the data is transmitted, it needs to be optimized so that the less amount of energy is consumed. The efficiency of the WSN depends on the numerous performance parameter of the network. A lifetime of network and energy consumption is the most important parameters in the design of a WSN. Various routing protocols have been designed to find the route in the network. Various energy efficient protocols have such as LEACH, DEEC, etc. were proposed, later on with Bio-inspired optimization like ACO, GA, PSO, etc. were used for finding the route in the network to increase the efficiency of the wireless sensor network but still there was need to design the algorithms that are more efficient than these in terms of energy consumption and network life, so in this paper an advancement in the PSO algorithm is proposed.

Communication among nodes influences their relationship. Relationship among nodes may be visible or invisible. The relationship among members of social networks passes through three stages of life cycles which are primary stage, secondary stage and termination Stage. Primary stages are those stages in which the relationship among two or more nodes are established. This relationship may be direct (i.e., one to one or one to many) and indirect (i.e., mutual relation, virtual relation etc.). Secondary stages are those stages in which the communication among nodes (i.e. members of social networks) starts. But there is always uncertainty related to communication among nodes of social networks. There may be chances that communication among nodes with each other may be for gap of short duration, medium duration or long duration. A sender may send a message to different others members of social networks but he may not get certain response on a message. Types of response on a message establishes the different kinds of relationship. In the present paper the authors made a study on probabilistic approach to establish different types of relationship among nodes on the basis of their response and with their activity.

In this paper, we consider enhancing both the network lifetime and throughput by using cooperative communication at the MAC layer. We formulate optimization problems with this objective for both single hop and multi hop networks. The solutions show that network lifetime and throughput can be significantly improved by using cooperative communications to forward packets at the MAC layer. We then propose a distributed cross-layer cooperative MAC protocol for a multi-hop network environment that can improve the network lifetime and energy efficiency while not degrading the network throughput and end-to-end delay.

In Mesochronous operation, data are processed in one or more processing clocks based on executing instructions. In this scheme, a delayed clock pulse is allotted for each instruction in the processing unit. Due to different clock frequencies for different instructions, the overhead of clock allocation is large. The conventional models derive the clock delay per cycle, building a large overhead in Mesochronous operation. This overhead is reduced, by a register alignment logic, where the redundancy of instructions are realigned in a clock Look Up Table (LUT), and an instruction index alignment is proposed to minimize the switching overhead of clock allocation for Mesochronous operation. The simulation results obtained illustrates the efficiency in clock saving in comparison to conventional clock allocation logic. © 2016 IEEE.","instruction index alignment; Mesochronous operation; Optimal clock allocation","Alignment; Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Data handling; Table lookup; Clock frequency; Clock pulse; Conventional models; Look up table; Mesochronous; Optimal clock allocation; Processing units; Switching scheme; Clocks",,"Tomar G.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509011445,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Sensor nodes deployed in forest environment enables to gather context information such as air pressure, temperature, object awareness, location of fire, fire condition (emergency level or non emergency level), and energy awareness about each node. Data aggregation plays an important role to conserve the network life of DMSN. Hence, in this paper we propose an software agent based energy efficient context aware data aggregation and dissemination in DMSN for the targeted area. The proposed model considers the context information such as temperature, air-pressure, energy, object awareness and helps in identifying the location of fire attack in the forest. Static and mobile software agents are used along with context awareness to improve the performance of the proposed scheme. To test the operation, proposed scheme is simulated using NS2.

To enhance the performance of sensor networks, clustering approach is used. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) comprises of large collection of sensors having different hardware configurations and functionalities. Due to limited storage space and battery life, complex security algorithms cannot be used in sensor networks. To solve the orphan node problem and to enhance the performance of the WSN, authors introduced many secure protocols such as LEACH, Sec-LEACH, GS-LEACH and R-LEACH, which were not secure for data transmission. The energy consumption in existing approach is more due to overhead incurred in computation and communication in order to achieve security.

This perception what Psychologists define as time is nothing but interference combined with interactions of one state of matter with the other which is stored as Memory in our Brain. Now Mind acts like a catalyst and makes us Aware in the process of Recall when we try to perceive time. The mind is the characteristics of our body which eventually drives the Brain. The Proposed Brain-Time Matrix is the measure of various interactions of our mind in our everyday life measured by a 7D Matrix which contains components like Time, Many-Worlds, Space, Illusion or Loop Holes.

Thus a remote and isolated village location is chosen where the modern civilization has not touched. The design makes the village self-sufficient in respect of electric power, water supply, street lighting, security, education and communication. Application of non-conventional methods of energy generation is the key for betterment as discussed here. Renewable and non-polluted power is generated from solar heat. The heat energy is captured and stored in water for use at night and in absence of sun. The solar heat energy tapped in water is utilized to rotate the turbines to provide electric power to each house. Additional power is also generated from piezoelectric substances like PZT, incorporated in the busy corners of a village, where the stress generated by human weight while walking is converted to electricity. Energy efficient street lamps with controlled light intensity as per the requirement have been designed. Water is provided to houses in cold and hot forms.

Generally, static based vernier TDC consumes more power due to two delay chain and D-flipflop. To avoid this issue an adiabatic based vernier TDC is proposed. This proposed TDC is constructed by using adiabatic inverter and D-flipflop but in classical TDC architecture consists of static based inverter and D-flipflop. A high resolution with low power is achieved in proposed TDC.

Furthermore, sensing accuracy is also essential for allocating vacant bands to the secondary users (SUs) for data transmission. Hence, this study focuses on designing an energy-efficient double threshold-based CRN. The adversarial effects arising in the presence of the attacker are analysed and are treated as constraints while formulating the energy efficiency (EE) maximisation problem. To develop the formulation, a unique SU selection algorithm to identify most eligible SUs for data transmission is proposed. The EE is then maximised by minimising the total power consumption through novel adaptive resource allocation algorithm. Hence, the authors proposed approaches are based on the suitable selection of SUs and adaptive power allocation under the constraints of maximum throughput, controlled transmission power providing sufficient protection to the primary user, minimum power consumption and minimum false alarm probability. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially increases EE with lower complexity over the conventional scheme. © 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Data transfer; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Resource allocation; Adaptive power allocation; Adaptive resource allocations; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Extensive simulations; False alarm probability; Primary user emulation attack (PUEA); Total power consumption; Cognitive radio","Das, D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, NITIndia; email: deepadas.ctc@gmail.com",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17518628,,,,"English","IET Commun.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032748305

With the wireless interfaces, these will communicate with one another just in case of cooperative communication in single or multiple hops. Multiple nodes are required for co-operative communication where the Stable Enable Protocol (SEP) and SEP-Vector Quantization (SEP-V) is used for cluster and active cluster head (CH) formation. Further Dijkstra Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the active cluster heads (CHs) and high energy utilization respectively.

The proposed work illustrates the SEP-Vector Quantization Dijkstra (SEP-VD) protocol, for shortest path active cluster head (CH) communication on a Cooperative communication network. From the applications point of view, SEP-VD determines the lowest energy path. SEP-V provides the intra-cluster communication between the cluster head and nodes.

Mutual authentication of a mobile user and cloud service provider is necessary for accessing of any cloud services. However, resource constraint nature of mobile devices makes this task more challenging. In this paper, we propose a new secure and lightweight mobile user authentication scheme for mobile cloud computing, based on cryptographic hash, bitwise XOR, and fuzzy extractor functions. Through informal security analysis and rigorous formal security analysis using random oracle model, it has been demonstrated that the proposed scheme is secure against possible well-known passive and active attacks and also provides user anonymity. Moreover, we provide formal security verification through ProVerif 1.93 simulation for the proposed scheme. Also, we have done authentication proof of our proposed scheme using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. Since the proposed scheme does not exploit any resource constrained cryptosystem, it has the lowest computation cost in compare to existing related schemes.

Despite the various environmental and economic benefits of Electric Vehicles, its charging will introduce enormous technical challenges on the existing network operation as the units consumed by a vehicle in a day is very high. It is almost four times that of units consumed by a typical residential load. Therefore with the penetration of Electric Vehicle into the market, power generated in India by non-renewable energy resources cannot meet the ever rising power demand of the country. The objective of this project is to implement a module which gives effective control logic for the integration of renewable energy resource and the electric vehicle with the utility. This involves a battery charging system which during off peak hours charges the battery and in peak hours supplies power to residential load. This paper also involves the study of installation of residential photovoltaic panels to the existing grid system along with Electric Vehicles.

However if a fault occurs during power swing, the relay should be unblocked to clear the fault quickly. This paper presents fault detection algorithm based on DWT during power swings. DWT is used to capture the travel time of the fault transients along the monitored lines between the fault points and relays. Travelling wave theory is utilized for analyzing power system fault transients. The voltage data at one end is sufficient to detect the fault, which reduces the errors caused due to current transformers. High sampling frequency is not required which reduces the burden of data acquisition. High resistance faults are also detected. Performance test is carried out in MatLab environment by considering different fault situations.

Objectives to find new ways of making our everyday lives more energy efficient have now became an essential part of the tussle to sustain our present quality of living. This project targets domestic usage which has a more direct approach in changing the way we consume energy. In this project we take up House Hold Loads as the application but this project can also be applied for large industrial loads. Smart energy metering and normalized energy data on load usage are one of the major goal setters for the future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes. Load Monitoring (LM) is essential for energy management and cost fixing. To obtain appliance-specific energy consumption statistics that can further be used to formulate load scheduling strategies for optimal energy utilization, disaggregation of Load is essential. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an alternative and best method for Load Disaggregation, as it can distinguish devices from the aggregated data measured at only a centralized location. In this paper we provide an experimental idea of using NILM technology by actually implementing sub-metering system for each load to forecast its futuristic development on the basis of bin packing algorithms and feedback systems controlled by the Machine Learning Algorithm to end up with an energy efficient smart home and smart grids. © 2017 IEEE.","Bin Packing; Energy Management; Feedback Systems; Graphic User Interface; Load Disaggregation; Machine Learning; Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring; Power Quality","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Behavioral research; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Feedback; Information management; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Power quality; User interfaces; Bin packing; Disaggregation; Feedback systems; Graphic user interface; Nonintrusive load monitoring; Smart power grids",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509040834,,,"English","Int.

The main suppliers of electrical power are government and public sector authorities but the power generation is not up to the mark to meet all power demands and so we are facing power cuts and load shedding to meet the future demand. To avoid complete breakdown of power we are introducing a new system by which power to individual consumers can be limited. The main components used are an intelligent embedded system with the most modern AVR controller, radio frequency based system and a set of Hall Effect sensors. The core logic behind the project is to monitor the current consumption at peak hours and to activate a breaker when the consumption increases beyond the limit value for that particular consumer.

Sensors nodes are energy constraints devices. For the sustainability of sensor networks energy optimization is the prime challenge for researchers which can be achieved by efficient design of clustering routing protocols. LEACH is one of the most renowned hierarchical routing protocols which prepare the fields for many other routing protocols for WSN. An enhanced version of LEACH is the EEEAC protocol which is an adaptive clustering based on residual energy of each node and generated uniform cluster heads over the network. Unlike EEEAC which considers unique identification of subarea code, for locating the nodes position in this paper we use the threshold level of mean link quality of sensor node for sub-area division. This process reduces the cost complexity and size of sensor nodes and non-functioning of GPS within indoor environment for area division. The significant contribution of this work lies in the real test bed implementation of both LEACH and our proposed model under SENSEnuts. Network stability and battery consumption are evaluated practically which shows that the modified EEEAC (mEEEAC) is the more energy efficient enhancing network lifetime. © 2017 IEEE.","clustering; energy efficient protocol; Hierarchical routing; Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH); TDMA schedule; Wireless Sensor networks (WSN)","Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Low power electronics; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Sustainable development; Time division multiple access; clustering; Clustering routing protocol; Energy Efficient clustering; Energy efficient protocols; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hierarchical routings; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509056194,,,"English","Proc.

Owing to the reduced energy dissipation in reversible circuits, a lot of research has been done on the design of reversible circuits. In reversible logic circuit designs, along with primary inputs, few constant inputs (Ancilla Inputs) are used to realize required reversible functions. In addition to this, few unused or extra output bits are generated; these bits are named as Garbage Output bits. A challenge in the reversible computation is to use minimum Ancilla Inputs and generate zero Garbage Outputs. In this work, we present designs for addition, subtraction, and addition or subtraction operations. The designs are primarily optimized to achieve zero Garbage Outputs and minimum Ancilla Inputs.

The sensors generally connect with each other wirelessly to form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Cloud computing is an emerging technology where the end users pay and access the services without worried about the infrastructure. Sensor cloud combines sensor network with the cloud computing in which the end users can access to the sensor network through the cloud computing. Sensor cloud should be energy efficient as the battery life of the sensor is finite and huge amount of energy is consumed in the cloud computing environment to provide services to the end users. The users request to access the sensor through the cloud system redirects every time to the sensor network, which causes more transmission in the sensor network as a result more energy is consumed.

From our analysis, we found that the Rprop-algorithm using logistic activation function is suitable as it provides nearly 97.2 percentage accuracy within an admissible delay of 13 seconds.

Efficient data collection is difficult and it depends on routing, power supply and remote location of node. To overcome the routing problem a new Bio-Inspired mechanism Ant Star Fuzzy (ASF) is proposed. ASF is a reliable and dynamic protocol, capable to provide energy efficient, data collecting routing structure in WSN. Network traffic and fast draining of energy of individual node is avoided. So this will increase the life of the network. ASF optimizes the routing paths even in the case of node drop of failure. It provides effective multi-path data transmission and reliable communication. The main objective is to increase the life span of network, during effective data communication in an efficient manner. This paper defines implementation of WSN and comparison of its performance with AODV, ACOAODV routing protocol based on ASF algorithm is done in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput and energy level. Performance of ASF algorithm compare with conventional algorithms gives improved results. © 2017 IEEE.","Ant Colony Optimization; AntStarFuzzy; AODV; Bio-Inspired Routing; Energy efficiency; Wireless sensor networks","Ant colony optimization; Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Optimization; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Stars; AntStarFuzzy; AODV; Bio-inspired routing; Conventional algorithms; Data-communication; Industrial wireless sensor networks; Packet delivery ratio; Reliable communication; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049295,,,"English","Proc.

The high-data rate applications running through mobile devices together with the radio access devices at the base stations (BS) cause a significant growth in energy consumption in the network accounting a large share of network operation expenditure (OpEx), as well as increased carbon emissions. Unlike an interference-free network, in the IL cellular network, a monotonically increase of the transmission power does not necessarily improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. For the analysis of the EE an information theoretic approach is applied and represented as a function of the BS transmission power considering the interference signals. A gradient based optimal level solution for the BS transmission power is derived to maximize EE. A network operator can significantly reduce the energy cost by setting the transmission power of the BS at the optimum level. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy Efficiency; Interference-limited Cellular Networks; Operation Expenditure; Poisson point process; Spectral Efficiency","4G mobile communication systems; Base stations; Energy utilization; Information theory; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; High data rate applications; Information-theoretic approach; Interference signal; LTE-Advanced systems; Operation Expenditure; Poisson point process; Spectral efficiencies; Energy efficiency",,"Stankovic Z.Z.Doncov N.S.Milovanovic B.D.Dimitrijevic T.Z.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538618004,,,"English","Int.

Cyber-Attacks are deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises, and networks. Deception, i.e., the act of making someone believe in something that is not true, could be a way of countering cyber-Attacks. In this paper, we propose a real-Time simulation environment ('Deception Game'), which we used to evaluate and model the decision making of hackers in the presence of deception. In an experiment, using a repeated Deception Game (N = 100 participants), we analyzed the effect of two factors on participants' decisions to attack a computer network: Amount of deception used and the timing of deception. Across 10-Attack trials, the amount of deception used was manipulated at 2-levels: low and high. The timing of deception was manipulated at 2-levels: early and late. Results revealed that using late and high deception caused a reduction in attacks on regular webserver compared to early and low deception. Furthermore, we developed a cognitive model of hacker's decision-making using Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory, a theory of decisions from experience. The parameters obtained from the model helped explain the reasons for our experimental results. © 2017 IEEE.","Amount of deception; Computational Modeling; Cyber-Attacks; Deception; Hackers; Honeypots; IBL; Timing of deception; Zero day attacks","Computation theory; Computer games; Computer networks; Crime; Decision making; Decision theory; Network security; Personal computing; Timing circuits; Amount of deception; Computational model; Cyber-attacks; Deception; Hackers; Honeypots; Timing of deception; Zero day attack; Computer crime",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509050604,,,"English","Int.

After identifying the energy loss in Industries, corrective steps can be taken for saving Electrical Energy. To study Electrical Energy losses and to implement energy savings methods, a preliminary energy audit was carried out on a single industrial feeder in an industrial area at Chennai in Tamilnadu, India. The audit team selected 50 industries in that feeder and collected data for estimating electrical Energy losses by designing several questions. The data collection was done by visiting the industries and through telephonic conversation by the Energy Audit team. After analyzing the conditions that were prevailing in the Industries, three vital areas which were contributing Electrical Energy losses,(namely non provision of Capacitors for power factor improvement, non utilization of LED lamps and not using energy efficient ISI mark Star rated motors) were identified and study was conducted. The suggested implementation for the three areas was tested with ETAP simulation and substantial Electrical energy savings was noticed.

Texture is an important spatial feature, useful for identifying facial objects of interest in an image. The most popular statistical methods used to measure the textural information of images are the grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and the texture spectrum (TS) Approach. The major problem of these two approaches is the dimensionality. This paper derives significant local information by deriving a new integrated matrix using fuzzy based texture unit and GLCM for efficient face recognition. The features derived from this integrated matrix provide detailed and complete texture information of about the human faces. Local binary pattern (LBP) operator is a powerful operator to extract the discriminative facial features and this method may fail to detect the illumination variation and facial expressions accurately. Noise is the crucial problem related to methods based on LBP also. To address these issues, the present paper derives a fuzzy logic on texture unit to discriminate the local information precisely than LBP and to reduce the dimensionality. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated using complex facial datasets, namely Yale and american telephone and telegraph company (AT&T). The present method is compared with methods based on LBP and the results indicate the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Dimensionality; GLCM; LBP; Texture spectrum; Texture unit","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computation theory; Fuzzy logic; Image texture; Matrix algebra; Dimensionality; GLCM; Grey level co-occurrence matrixes; Illumination variation; Local binary pattern operators; Textural information; Texture information; Texture spectrum; Face recognition",,"Niranjan Dr.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063994,,,"English","Proc.

In this scheme, multiple secrets are reconstructed stage by stage in the dealer's predetermined order, and only one secret shadow is kept by every participant. Later Harn improved the He and Dawson's scheme to reduce the total number of public values. But Chang et al. showed that both He and Dawson's scheme and Harn's scheme are not multi use schemes and secrets are not infact reconstructed stage by stage and proposed a new scheme to deal with these problems. Then Li et al. improved Chang et al.'s scheme to reduce the total number of public values.

In WSN, effective use of energy resource is one of the challenging research issues as the battery limits the lifetime of sensor node. The Rumor Routing has advantages in energy saving by making full use of two features: clustering structure and next-hop scheme. This rumor routing algorithm in WSN allows query source to distribute query to identify source which helps to get timely query message but the energy efficiency is made better using hierarchical method by clustering formation, where the appropriate selection of cluster head reduces energy conservation. So we have fuzzy logic as the proposed method which is based on three features : Centrality, Energy, Distance. The mobile co-ordinator is used in this method to increase the network efficiency. Thus fuzzy logic can effectively avoid the problems that occur in RR and can provide more energy-efficient routing paths. The performance between fuzzy logic using mobile co-ordinator and RR are evaluated by simulations.

But direct use of PEM fuel cell as a single power source for electric vehicles is restricted due to its slow dynamics and less peak power supplying capability. Hydrogen safety, being used as fuel for these vehicles, is another biggest problem. Now days, in electric vehicles using PEM fuel, the fuel cell is hybridized with supercapacitor or high power battery to improve its slow dynamics and peak power supplying capability. But hybrid system increases complexity, require more space for installation and also has high cost. The present paper proposes new protocol for the development of MEA (Membrane Electrode Assembly) for PEM fuel cell to overcome its slow dynamics, low peak power supplying capability and also proposes a reactor for generation of hydrogen on board from methanol to provide hydrogen safety.

The temporal correlation of the sparse vectors is modeled using a first-order autoregressive process. The online algorithm is formulated using the sparse Bayesian learning framework and is implemented using a sequential expectation-maximization procedure. Our algorithm is noniterative in nature, and requires less computational and memory resources compared to offline processing. We analyze the convergence of the algorithm in the case when the sparse vectors are uncorrelated, using tools from stochastic approximation theory. We show that the sequence of the covariance estimates converge either to the global minimum of the offline equivalent cost function or to the all zero vector, regardless of the sparsity level of the signal. Through numerical results, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online algorithm and compare it with its offline counterpart as well as with existing online sparse vector recovery algorithms.

The conventional pipelining of domino logic designs are more prone to timing overhead due to the factors, namely, clock skew, delay caused by the latches, and its inability to borrow time. Methods/Statistical analysis: The cascaded pipelined domino stages utilizes two and four phase clocks for sequencing the operation. The pipelined stages are sensitive to clock edges, and are incapable of borrowing time. Hence, latches are included between the consecutive stages to facilitate the pipeline. Considering the required computation time of the circuit, the speed enhancement in a domino logic pipelined circuit could be achieved by reducing the precharge and evaluation period. Findings: In this paper, four phase self-timed clocking scheme is implemented on a pipelined domino logic ALU. In addition to the maximum computation time of an individual stage, the setup and hold time are also considered for defining the clock evaluation time in the four phase scheme. Furthermore, it is ensured that the precharge operation happens only after the previous output is passed on to the next stage. The analysis and comparison of the conventional pipelined domino circuit design, the skew tolerant self timed pipeline design of an inverter chain and the ALU, using two phase and four phase overlapping clocks are done using Cadence® Virtuoso Spectre employing 180nm technology library and analyzed in the ADE-L environment. Improvements/Applications: The skew tolerant self-timed design of the domino logic pipelined ALU demonstrates an increased speed of 60% and reduction in power of 30% as compared to the single phase pipelined ALU design. © 2017 IEEE.","Clock Skew in Domino Logic; Domino Logic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU); Pipelined ALU; Pipelined Domino; precharge; Self-Timed Domino","Clocks; Computation theory; Electric clocks; Electric network analysis; Integrated circuit manufacture; Logic circuits; Pipelines; Arithmetic logic unit; Domino Logic; Pipelined ALU; Pipelined Domino; Pre-charge; Self-timed; Computer circuits",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

From bank transactions to document verification portals, from government official websites to social media, all these platforms share data remotely over web which contains certain confidential information and thus uses security mechanisms based on cryptographic algorithm to preserve the confidentiality of data preventing any information leakage or breach. RSA being the most popular public key cryptography based algorithm uses data encryption and decryption technique. It uses the mathematical concept of factorization of prime integers. The efficiency of the algorithm in terms of enhancing the security aspect to guess the factors of prime numbers increase when the numbers have high powers. Computing prime factors of these large numbers is compute intensive task where the serial programming makes RSA algorithm to slow down. The paper here presents an OpenMP based algorithmic modification to the code of RSA algorithm to improve the execution time using the parallel processing power of modern day multi-core architecture based machines. Experimental results under the lights of graphical representation shows a considerable speed up gained over the traditional implementation. Further the paper also compares the efficiency with other parallel implementations of RSA algorithm where the reported algorithm is found to perform almost equivalent to the GPGPU based implementation without the need of extra hardware in the form of graphics card and with reduced power consumption of the machine.

The routing protocol for wireless sensor networks mainly aims in the energy-efficiency of the network. Due to restricted energy, memory, transmission range, power and high traffic load, the nodes which act as a sink get depleted quickly. Because of these so many approaches proposed over past years to reduce energy consumption and to prolong network lifetime. Energy consumption of the network can be reduced by means of using the mobile sink and it also reduces the hotspot problem. Hence Virtual Grid based Data Gathering technique using mobile agent (VGDG-MA) for WSN with mobile sink is proposed. Mobile agent is the one which is used to collect the data by flexibly planning its route. In this paper, virtual grid based data gathering technique using mobile agent is presented that mainly aims to reduce the route construction path frequently in a grid structure. Mobile agent is placed in a multihop environment which automatically clones and migrates based on the environmental changes. Instead of mobile sink, these mobile agents migrate in the environment and collect data, clone when it leaves the particular node results in energy consumption and also reduce the construction cost of the network. Based on residual energy of the node, sink relocates its position and avoids network failure. Proposed method shows that mobile agent can powerfully transfer data from sink to source and source to which results in energy consumption, good packet delivery ratio. Simulation results shows that the proposed VGDG-MA increases the network lifetime and gives better results in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and throughput when compared with other protocols.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the energy efficiency of single cell and multi cell Massive MIMO, where transmit and circuit power consumption, training overhead, channel estimation, pilot contamination and decontamination is taken into account. Maximal energy efficiency for the system is obtained by using Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) for given number of antennas and users by optimizing the transmit power.

And when it comes to alternative energy sources, the world of science is trying to find ways to increase the efficiency of these sources as much as Is possible. After cost and efficiency, storage is the biggest obstacle preventing widespread use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The ability to store energy when it is produced is an essential waypoint on the road to turning alternative energy into regular energy. This problem of storage can be solved by supercapacitors[1] as these can store more energy as compared to the conventional capacitors. The properties of supercapacitors are greatly affected by its internal materials and the procedure of construction [2]. This paper focuses on the effect of using different types of carbon for the making of the supercapacitor on the capacitance and its other properties. Also the effect on these properties was observed by applying different techniques during the construction of the electrolytes for the supercapacitor. The two techniques used for putting the overcoat (the second layer) of the metal oxide and activated were drop method and dip method. The change by varying the proportion of the active carbon and the metal oxide was also observed and studied. This paper gives an extensive analysis on the various ways of making a supercapacitor in a quest to find the most effective procedure, so that the supercapacitor with the best performance can be obtained. © 2017 IEEE.","Electro-chemical Double Layer Capacito; Electrode; Electrode material; Supercapacitor","Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Metallic compounds; Metals; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Alternative energy; Alternative energy source; Conventional capacitors; Double layers; Electrode material; Fabrication process; Use of renewable energies; Wind and solar power; Supercapacitor",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithms to determine rendezvous point (RP) based dynamic path for mobile sink called delay aware energy density based trajectory (DAEDT). The DAEDT designs an energy efficient delay bound path for the mobile sink. In order to balance energy consumption among the sensor nodes, the proposed algorithm selects RPs based on the energy density of the sensor nodes. The DAEDT is also presented with a detour criteria following some threshold.

Hence, the problem of high power consumption, increased carbon footprints and need for higher cooling effects arose. However, resource scheduling and provisioning has become a milestone to handle such diverse issues related to cloud and get them under centralized control system. Workload prediction is an utmost requirement to dynamically predict the incoming workload and schedule the resources according to client needs. Dynamic workload prediction based on historical data can prove useful for pattern matching of current scenario with the past ones and allocate the resources in the most efficient way. This paper aims to propose a prototype model for workload prediction using machine learning models to handle the dynamic nature of the cloud infrastructure.

On the other hand, the service delay is also depended on the response time of edge services from different mobile applications. Hence, there exists a disparity between the actual and measured service delay experienced by the mobile edge devices. This type problem arises due to the fact that the wireless radio network infrastructure is shared by the multiple mobile devices. As a result, the congestion occurs in the network and the arrival packets are likely to be dropped by the network switches in the access network. In such situation, the real-Time critical edge applications mostly care about the quality-of-service (QoS) for different mobile devices, while offloading the edge services to edge servers. Thus, we improve the QoS of edge devices using delay-Agnostic service offloading scheme to meet the offloading requirements of those delay-Agnostic applications. Prior works have devoted to filling the gap at edge network by introducing the priority-based computational offloading [1] or energy-efficient resource allocation [4] schemes for edge computing applications. However, the priority-based service offloading and resource allocation do not provide the fair QoS to mobile devices, as the actual bottleneck is usually existed in the delay-Agnostic nature of mobile applications. Therefore, although the existing offloading schemes perform well for multi-modal applications in terms of energy efficiency and computational overhead [1]. However, in those works, they assumed that the delay requirement of services to be fixed, but in real-life the delay requirement of services may vary radically. This type of situation is considered to be delay-agnostic property for edge devices, in this poster. Looking at the above points, we propose DESERVE, which introduces a delay-Agnostic service offloading scheme for mobile edge computing platform in order to improve the QoS of each individual. The overview of DESERVE is depicted in Figure 1. For the edge devices, the exible and optimal resource allocation technique is exploited for delay-Agnostic service offloading scheme in edge computing platform. The resource allocation technique is leveraged for edge devices using the advanced techniques of software defined networks (SDN). However, an adaptive service identifier is deployed specifically for the identification of critical edge applications at the edge of mobile edge platform, instead of installing centralized SDN controller. After the identification of critical edge services, the identified services are forwarded to the controller and the corresponding rules to be offloaded for those services in the edge servers of edge platform. © 2017 ACM.",,"Computational efficiency; Energy efficiency; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Resource allocation; Traffic congestion; Adaptive services; Computational overheads; Energy-efficient resource allocation; Mobile applications; Network switches; Optimal resource allocation; Resource allocation techniques; Wireless radio networks; Quality of service",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450350877,,,"English","ACM/IEEE Symp.

Transmission control protocol (TCP) performs poorly in such environment, which misinterprets the reordered packets as lost packets due to congestion. This has motivated us on developing a new protocol towards the packet reordering for improving the performance of TCP in MANETs. Optimal path or route selection is the major concern to improve the energy efficiency and network lifetime. In this paper, trust aware routing protocol for selecting optimal route in MANET is proposed. Based on this protocol, trust value for each node is calculated using direct and indirect trust value. Then the routing cost metric value is calculated and the path with minimum cost metric value is chosen as the best path in the network. After selecting the optimal path, data packet is to be transmitted through the optimal path. During the transmission, the data packet may get dropped or reordered due to congestion or mobility. A cross layer approach between network layer and transport layer to identify the dropped and reordered packets in the network is proposed in this paper. Simulation results are reported, which support this proposal. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cross layer approach; MANET; Reorder identifying TCP (RI-TCP); Transmission control protocol (TCP); Trust aware routing protocol","Energy efficiency; Network layers; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Transmission control protocol; Transportation routes; Cross-layer approach; Indirect trust values; MANET; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Reorder identifying TCP (RI-TCP); Reordered packets; Routing cost metric; Trust-aware; Mobile ad hoc networks","Sunitha, D.; Computer Science & Engineering, Kamala Institute of Technology and Science, Huzurabad, India; email: sunithaphd2016@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031088918

The MIMO-OFDM systems has a major drawback as is it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which in turn requires designing of efficient power amplifier (PA), in order to maintain a wider linear region for preventing signal clipping, which therefore increases hardware complexity and power consumption. The various PAPR reduction algorithms have been developed which provide a maximum PAPR reduction ranging from 0.5 to 6 dB. The maximum SNR loss after applying a Beamforming technique is reported around 0.2 dB with BER of around 10-4 to 10-6. In the current work.

Hierarchical routing protocols are best known for energy efficiency. PDCH is a routing protocol with double cluster head. It elects its cluster head based on the distance from base station. In MBC the cluster head is selected based on the residual energy and mobility. A non-cluster head has to transmit data before its transmission power is finised to the cluater head so with in the TDMA schedule data should be send. Here simulation were conducted in NS2 Software. The QoS parameters that were compared were Delay, Throughput, Packet drop ratio and Energy consumed. From the simulation it was clear that PDCH outperformed MBC by 15.13%, 4.87%, 14.29% and 23.19% for the above parameters. © 2017 IEEE.","Hierarchical routing; LEACH; MBC; mobility; PDCH; PEGASIS; TDMA; WSN","Carrier mobility; Computer network performance evaluation; Computer software; Energy efficiency; Leaching; Optical communication; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Hierarchical routing protocol; Hierarchical routings; Packet drop ratios; PDCH; PEGASIS; QoS parameters; Residual energy; Transmission power; Time division multiple access",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21517681,9781467392778; 9781509048847,,,"English","IFIP Int.

Precisely WSNs are well-known in real time applications using homogeneous sensor nodes. As sensor nodes are battery powered, it will become dead after consumption of the battery which decides the lifetime of WSNs. The battery of sensor nodes is neither replaced nor recharged. Hence it is essential to introduce the techniques to prolong the lifetime of the WSNs. Heterogeneous nodes in wireless sensor network is an effective way to increase network lifetime. This involves the need for energy efficiency in heterogeneous WSNs. Limitation on energy is a major concern, and hence it can be managed efficiently using clustering. In homogeneous clustering, each sensor node has equal initial energy but in heterogeneous clustering. There are two or more types of sensor nodes that have different initial energy. This paper describes the various heterogeneous WSN protocols that carry out a survey of the recent clustering protocols for heterogeneous WSNs. Heterogeneous routing protocols for WSNs are categorized based on some predefined performance estimation metrics such as network lifetime, number of heterogeneity level, cluster head selection, energy efficiency and stability. © 2017 IEEE.","energy efficient routing protocols; Heterogeneity; Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head selections; Energy efficient routing protocol; Heterogeneity; Heterogeneous routing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Performance estimation; Real-time application; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032433,,,"English","Proc.

The proposed technique illustrates the TEEN-Vector Quantization (TEEN-V) protocol, for intra-cluster communication in a cooperative communication network. As per the application point of view, TEEN-V performs the lowest energy path for intra cluster communication. TEEN provides the optimum cluster size and their cluster head and using VQ, the minimum distance is calculated using Euclidean distance between the multiple cluster heads which creates the shortest path results in energy efficient technique. Further the spectral distortion of the proposed technique has been analysed for practical implementation. © 2017 IEEE.","cooperative communication; Energy efficient; TEEN; Vector Quantization; Wireless Sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Vector quantization; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-based protocol; Energy efficient; Energy efficient networks; Energy-efficient techniques; Intra-cluster communication; Multiple cluster-heads; Research applications; TEEN; Cooperative communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032433,,,"English","Proc.

Brain MRI classification into normal and abnormal has received increasing attention because of the high level of difficulty in handling those huge numbers of images. Recently, many computational techniques are widely employed to segregate the normal images from pathological. Thus, this study has attempted to analyse the capability of various supervised data mining techniques in classifying the brain MR images. Initially, the images are pre-processed and the volumetric features are extracted. Then, these are fed into feature selection techniques viz. Principal Component Analysis, Runs, Fisher filtering and ReliefF feature selection to determine relevant features. The selected features are utilised for the supervised data mining techniques viz. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Tree and C4.5 to identify the abnormal images of brain. Among them, SVM has achieved highest accuracy of 71.33% with the features extracted through ReliefF feature selection with Leave-One-Out cross validation. Random Tree achieved accuracy of 82% with Runs filtered features. The classification will aid the segmentation of brain tumor from large set of MRI slices by eliminating the normal slices. This greatly reduces the computational time and memory required for the process of segmentation. © 2017 IEEE.","Brain Tumor; Classification; Data Mining; Machine Learning Challenge; Magnetic Resonance Images","Brain; Computation theory; Computational methods; Data mining; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image classification; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Principal component analysis; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Tumors; Accurate prediction; Brain tumors; Computational technique; Computational time and memory; Leave-one-out cross validations; Level of difficulties; Selection techniques; Volumetric features; Classification (of information)",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

It is also used for online gaming, surfing, chatting and also used for storing the personal information like photos, videos, documents and other important files. In this scenario, it is no surprise that the basic demand for utilizing a smart phone is secure authentication. Though a number of authentication schemes have been proposed in the literature through PIN numbers, passwords and patterns, they are susceptible for shoulder surfing or smudging attacks. Thus, combing gestures with such authentication schemes prove to be more successful in the present times and hence a new kind of pattern has been proposed with essential gestures such as finger pressure and inclination of the phone while it is being unlocked. This work is different from the previous works in two dimensions. First, the proposed pattern is secure against both shoulder surfing and smudging attacks. Second, the computational complexity of authentication scheme has been reduced. Through extensive experiments it can be proved that this work outperforms many works in the recent literature and hence it would be an ideal candidate for the secure authentication of smart phones. © 2017 IEEE.","Authentication; Biometric; Fuzzy; Gesture; Security; Smartphone","Authentication; Biometrics; Computation theory; Computational methods; Mobile security; Network security; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Telephone sets; Authentication scheme; Fuzzy; Gesture; Personal information; Secure authentications; Security; Sensitive application; Social networking applications; Cryptography",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

First we calculate the load trends and solar and wind power produced in the two solar units. Then we go on to implement grid outage management using Multi Agent System based distributed energy management of solar micro-grid with smart grid structure. We develop a simulation model in Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) for dynamic model which takes into account the closely knit nature of solar power, impermanence of load, dynamic appraising of grid and variation of critical loads and choose the best possible action every hour to stabilize and optimize the micro-grid. Furthermore, MAS increases the functional efficiency and thereby maximize the power production of solar micro-grid and minimizes the operational cost. Thus MAS in micro-grid leads to optimization of both capital and environmental resources. Simulated working of solar generators and loads are studied by conducting simulations for different agent motives.

Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. If this produces unsatisfactory results, you can try manual guesses. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a 'smooth' function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. For built-in curve fitting functions, you can let Igor automatically set the initial guesses. For the other built-in data fitting functions and for user-defined functions, the operation must be iterative.

Water bodies like dams, lakes, ponds play major role in storing and distributing the water in efficient manner. Stored water is used for drinking purpose, agriculture irrigation, electricity generation, etc. Sometimes excess storage of water causes flood during heavy raining season and kills valuable resources including human life. This mandates that the water bodies should be frequently monitored and controlled for the benefits of mankind. Water body monitoring involves the quantity and quality of water stored, input and output water flow through inlet and outlet shutters respectively, condition of the inlet and outlet shutters, condition of the channels carry the water to oceans during flood, etc. Conventional manual monitoring of water bodies consists several disadvantages including high manual overhead, low accuracy and excess time in measurements, high communication delay, high cost, life threatening risks during measurements, etc. The objective of the proposed work is to automatically monitor and control the smart water bodies to sort out the disadvantages of conventional monitoring. The proposed system consists of Remote Monitoring and Control Station (RMCS), Field Control Unit (FCU), Patrol Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PUAV), different floating sensors like rainfall sensor, water quality sensor, inlet and outlet shutter interfaces, alarms. The proposed system is able to monitor the water body frequently and prepares accurate report that includes quantity of water, rainfall rate, input and output water flow rate, quality of water like existence of any poisonous chemical contents, working condition of the inlet/outlet shutters, etc. This report is quickly sent to the RMCS for further actions. The RMCS can pull the complete report or any particular information on demand. Further the RMCS processes the report to extract the knowledge for further actions like opening/closing shutters, replacing damaged sensors, directing PUAVs to capture the pictures, sending messages to field officials and operators, etc. As a whole, the proposed system significantly reduces the manual overhead, cost, time required to measure/check various factors while increasing the accuracy of measurements and enables the remote monitoring unit to monitor and govern the water body in all aspects. © 2017 IEEE.","Remote monitoring system; Smart water body; UAV; Water quality; Water quantity","Aircraft control; Automobile bodies; Computation theory; Computational methods; Floods; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Military vehicles; Monitoring; Potable water; Quality control; Rain; Remote control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water quality; Accuracy of measurements; Conventional monitoring; Electricity generation; Remote monitoring and control; Remote monitoring and control systems; Remote monitoring system; Water quantities; Waterbodies; Water resources",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Technological advancements of Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and cloud did the process in a simpler and acceptable way to share the fact and figures that makes complicated and time consuming decision making with more assurance level. Later on, increase in an IT reflected the storage, management, integration and correlation of huge data which has an impact in the efficiency of the operations growth rate. It is more important to secure the geospatial data which is stored in the public cloud to ensure who is accessing the data to reducerisks to information, national security, or perhaps for other reasons. This research proposes an efficient way of storing the geospatial data in public cloud using Spatial Hadoop mechanism in cloud computing environment. The Spatial Hadoop-GIS is a scalable and high performance spatial data warehousing system for running large scale spatial queries on Spatial Hadoop. Itwill support multiple types of spatial queries on MapReduce through spatial partitioning, customizable spatial query engine.

It is nearly impossible for human to process all these data and it is even difficult for computers to extract the information since it is not stored in structured format. Identifying the named entities and classifying them can help in extracting the useful information in the unstructured text documents. This paper presents a new method of utilizing biomedical knowledge by both exact matching of disease dictionary and adding semantic concept feature through UMLS semantic type filtering, in order to improve the human disease named entity recognition by machine learning. By engineering the concept semantic type into feature set, we demonstrate the importance of domain knowledge on machine learning based disease NER.

In spite of the huge involvement of users in search engines, their limited capabilities to understand the user context and emotions places high load on the user to maintain the search momentum. Thus the research is being done on the web search process including the users. The aim is to reduce the contextual and emotional mismatch between the SE's and users. Personalized user query processing, current knowledge updation on users, information retrieval effectiveness and user satisfaction are the major challenges to be addressed in this field. To meet the high level requirements of the users and to improve the intellectualization level of the search, various cognitive agent based SE models are proposed in the literature. The challenges of the cognitive agents in present search engine scenario are obtaining sufficient percepts from the environment, understanding it, gathering the knowledge and retrieving the information from the huge volume of data. Recent advancements in the field of semantic search engines, knowledge gathering techniques and information retrieval methods are discussed which can better the cognitive agent based search engines by addressing the challenges.

In recent years, surveillance systems are widely used in all places starting from border security application to street monitoring systems. As the analysis of surveillance video becomes one of the most emerging trends and research fields of interest, there is a need for a comprehensive survey on various works being carried out in the field. A single surveillance camera records the happenings in a particular field of view both day and night at all time, likewise multi-camera environment generates a huge volume of data. Though motion sensitivity based cameras considerably reduce the storage volume, they still produce large volume of data when employed in busy areas. The large amount of video data cannot be fully observed for analysis as it is time overwhelming process. Hence it is required to summarize the activities in the scene and detect unusual events recorded in videos. Hence, this paper discusses various techniques for summarization and unusual event detection in video and it presents current scenario of research in this area.

The major aspire of this proposed Improved Weis to identify an accurate data search and also to generate data that comes from anywhere. Furthermore, the data itself may be too large to store on a single machine such that the computers are inter connected with each other by the massive internet storage technologies. This approach mainly focuses on design of search engines and its infrastructure grave. Improved Micro partitioning is a modularized approach of cloud computing mainly framed to overcome the pitfalls in the traditional search engine and also in manipulation of large information stored in a single computer. The Map Reduce Task Scheduling algorithm which has been used in the cloud helps in overcoming the challenges of conventional methodologies. The map reduce protocol model is a simple model that makes the data to save in different locations by partitioning the data technique.

The cloud users are enjoying the on-demand services provided by the cloud computing environment without maintaining the data in a local system. Even though the service is offered to cloud users in an efficient way, there are some serious security issues to be considered very much for maintaining and accessing the data in a secure way from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). On the data placed in the cloud servers located in any part of the world, various security attacks might be performed by both the internal and external attackers to break the security services like confidentiality on data, user and server authentication, data integrity, and access control of data. This survey provides a detailed study of the recent security issues existing in the cloud environment. This study shows communication architecture of cloud computing and exhibits the security services data confidentiality, data integrity, user privacy, authentication and access control. There are five security services that need to be provided in the cloud network to make it a safe one in real time environment.

The main aim of the feature subset selection is to find most informative features from the vast number of features in the high dimensional data. Filter, wrapper and embedded methods are currently used to solve these issues. In this paper, we have incorporated wrapper based subset selection technique for selecting a subset from the high dimensional datasets. In this approach to find the optimal threshold value, the feature subsets are given to the classifier iteratively until the maximum accuracy is obtained. The symmetrical uncertainty method is used to weight the features to predict the predominant feature. For validating the incorporated algorithm, we have used 10-fold cross validation against the two standard classification techniques such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the results are tabulated and compared. The comparison between the results shows that the proposed method gives the better accuracy and results. © 2017 IEEE.","Feature reduction; Feature selection; Feature subset selection; Filter method; High dimensional data; Symmetrical uncertainty; Wrapper method","Clustering algorithms; Computation theory; Computational methods; Data mining; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Set theory; Support vector machines; Feature reduction; Feature subset selection; Filter method; High dimensional data; Symmetrical uncertainty; Wrapper methods; Classification (of information)",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In this paper, an Energy Efficient Routing Through Open Virtual Switches (EERTOVS) algorithm is proposed to route the traffic efficiently in the power-optimal selected path. The proposed algorithm was implemented using Open Flow Protocol in the forthcoming development of Software Defined Networks. Thereby, the network management entails the improvement in energy conservation with tolerable level of compromising the network performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Data centric network(DCN); Energy Efficient Routing Through Open Virtual switches (EERTOVS); Open Flow Protocol (OFP); Open Virtual Switches (OVS); Software Defined Network (SDN)","Computation theory; Computational methods; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Network function virtualization; Power management (telecommunication); Routing algorithms; Cloud data centers; Cloud environments; Data-centric networks; Energy efficient routing; Network resource allocations; Network virtualization; Open flow; Open Virtual Switches (OVS); Distributed computer systems",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Most of the existing systems use the routing techniques which consume lot of energy during data communication. Hence, the energy of sensor nodes depletes and results in decrease its lifetime. To overcome the above limitation in this paper we propose a new routing technique called agent based fuzzy swarm optimization (FSO) routing technique which provides dynamic clustering and effective optimized routing. Because of this technique the energy of sensor nodes has been conserved and used effectively which ultimately increases the lifetime of the network.

In addition, online shopping provides the product reviews and helps the customer to get the better among the variety of brands. In this, mining the opinion words and the polarity of the reviews are the important task to detect the exact opinion of the customer reviews. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed based on the semi-supervised word alignment model (SWAM), which identifies the relations among the words in a sentence. It's a graph-based algorithm where target opinion words are compared with the other opinion word and extract the long span relations among the words. Unlike, syntax based method, this proposed model reduce the parsing errors by dealing with informal online texts. The mined reviews of this proposed system provides better precision when compared with standard unsupervised alignment review models. The experimental results show that this approach effectively mining the user reviews and provide the better recommendation. © 2017 IEEE.","Opinion word; Polarity; Relation graph; Word alignment","Computation theory; Computational methods; Graphic methods; Syntactics; Graph-based algorithms; Online shopping; Opinion word; Polarity; Product reviews; Relation graph; Semi-supervised; Word alignment; Sales",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The SIP protocol, which works on the top of TCP or UDP, is basically an open text-based protocol. Hence, to ensure security is of utmost importance. The original SIP used HTTP-digest based challenge-response authentication process. However, HTTP digest-based authentication is insecure and pre-existing user configuration on the remote server is needed. Moreover, it provides only one-way message authentication and replay protection, but not the support message integrity and confidentiality. Although, quite a few three factor SIP protocols using password, smartcard and biometric are existing in the literature, however, none of them are robust against known attacks.

SIM can be used to store a number of user sensitive information such as user contacts, SMS, banking information (some banking applications store user credentials on the SIM) etc. Unfortunately, the current SIM model has a major weakness. When the mobile device is lost, an adversary can simply steal a user's SIM and use it. He/she can then extract the user's sensitive information stored on the SIM. Moreover, The adversary can then pose as the user and communicate with the contacts stored on the SIM. This opens up the avenue to a large number of social engineering techniques. Additionally, if the user has provided his/her number as a recovery option for some accounts, the adversary can get access to them. The current methodology to deal with a stolen SIM is to contact your particular service provider and report a theft. The service provider then blocks the services on your SIM, but the adversary still has access to the data which is stored on the SIM. Therefore, a secure scheme is required to ensure that only legal users are able to access and utilize their SIM. © 2017 IEEE.","Carrier; ECC; HLR; IMSI; Ransomware; SIM; Social engineering; VLR","Computation theory; Computational methods; Malware; Mobile devices; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Carrier; IMSI; Mobile communications; Secure protocols; Sensitive informations; Service provider; Social engineering; Subscriber identity module; Mobile telecommunication systems",,"Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047994,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The proposed approach consider two resources i.e., CPU and memory, as decision metrics for load balancing and use three thresholds named lower threshold, upper threshold and warning threshold to define underloaded, overloaded and warning situations, respectively. The main concept of this approach is to place VM to the PM, where resource requirement of the VM and resource utilization of the PM are complements to each other. To evade unnecessary migrations due to the temporary peak load AR time series prediction model is used.

Energy efficiency and bit error rate (BER) performance are the basic criteria to be taken into account while designing an optimal error correction scheme for WSNs. In this paper, a novel energy efficient error control scheme is proposed which minimizes the energy overheads of a typical error control scheme such as additional bits’ transmit energy and encoding/decoding energy, while achieving a better BER performance compared to the standard schemes. The redundant bits’ transmit energy is saved by incorporating compression and coding energy is minimized by employing simpler operations compared to other schemes. Further,the proposed scheme is validated in the context of mica2 motes. The BER performance and energy consumption of the presented scheme are studied and compared with standard error control schemes,such as, Hamming (7, 4) and RS (31, 29). Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology yielding a coding gain (CG) of 4.093 dB with a parameter selection of {30, 7, 2, 5}, in AWGN channel at BER of 10 - 5, as compared to CG of 0.561 dB and 1.485 dB obtained using Hamming (7, 4) and RS (31, 29), respectively.

RSW is conventional but not obsolete as it addresses the desirable characteristics of energy efficiency, narrow heat-affected zone (HAZ), simplicity, and automation that make it the first choice of manufacturers. In recent days, there is a perpetual demand for spot welding owing to its suitability for joining components especially in biomedical applications. Austenitic stainless steel of grade AISI 316L, a biocompatible material with extraordinary features and global suitability, caters to several industrial dimensions. In this research paper, an attempt is made to experimentally investigate the quality of the weld prepared by resistance spot welding of austenitic stainless steel type 316L of equal thickness (2.0 + 2.0 mm). Experimental trials based on design of experiments (DOE) are conducted by varying the process parameters such as electrode tip diameter, welding current, and heating time and subsequently measure the nugget size and shape which governs the strength and bond integrity of the resistance spot welds. Subsequently, a coupled structural-thermo-electric analysis is performed to analyse the transient temperature field for predicting the nugget formation during RSW of 316L stainless sheet using a 2D axisymmetric finite element (FE) model. FE-based model of RSW process is developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) module available in FE package, ANSYS. Thermo-physical interactions like heat transfer through the Joule effect, the effect of latent heat of fusion, and the thermal and electrical contact conductance are considered while developing the FE-based model. A good coherence is achieved between numerical predictions of nugget shape and experimental spot-welded results. Finally, the welded specimens are subjected to destructive testing and metallurgical characterizations to evaluate its strength and quality. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","AISI 316L; ANSYS; Finite element analysis; Nugget; RSW","Aerospace industry; Austenitic stainless steel; Automobile manufacture; Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Coupled circuits; Design of experiments; Electric welding; Energy efficiency; Finite element method; Heat affected zone; Heat transfer; Joining; Medical applications; Quality control; Resistance welding; Spot welding; Temperature; Welding; Welds; Aisi 316l; ANSYS; ANSYS parametric design language; Influence of process parameters; Metallurgical characterization; Nugget; RSW; Transient temperature fields; Stainless steel","Jagadeesha T; Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Institute of Technology NITIndia; email: t.jagdeesha@gmail.com",,"Springer London",02683768,,IJATE,,"English","Int J Adv Manuf Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939824716

Assortative, relational, and proximity mechanisms are the recognized social processes that are responsible for the formation of these dyadic ties. In this paper, we develop an agent-based model that derives its essence from social processes, fuzzy game theory, and social network analysis. The process of dyadic friendship formation depends on the agent's (participant's) spatial configuration, attributes affecting friendship, and interaction with other agents. To model these interactions, we use fuzzy iterated prisoner's dilemma (Fuzzy-IPD) utilizing the decision factors contributing to similar social processes. These strategies have been independently discussed in previously published studies. We, however, use them in combination to design a descriptive model with different experimental settings in an ad-hoc simulation framework. Using an integrationist approach, we blend multiple individual components of friendship formation to construct a comprehensive model. The analysis of the model thus developed reveals a possible interaction pattern responsible for the evolution of the layered associations. This paper further validates various levels of friendship ties (strong ties, medium ties, and weak ties) in social networks as reported in the published sociological studies. © 2013 IEEE.","Agent based modelling; dyadic friendship formation; fuzzy logic; game theory; simulation of social networks; social dynamics; social evolution","Analytical models; Association reactions; Autonomous agents; Computation theory; Computational methods; Game theory; Heuristic algorithms; Mathematical models; Agent-based modelling; Computational model; Dyadic Friendship Formation; Social dynamics; Social evolution; Social network services; Fuzzy logic","Goyal, R.; University School of Information, Communication and Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha UniversityIndia; email: rinkajgoyal@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030778171

The study of these transport problems will help with accurate prediction of drug transport and optimizing treatment strategy. To this end, liposome mediated drug delivery has emerged as an excellent anticancer therapy due to its ability to deliver drugs at site of action and reducing the chances of side effects to the healthy tissues. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on realistic vasculature of human brain tumor is presented. This model utilizes dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data to account for heterogeneity in tumor vasculature. Porosity of the interstitial space inside the tumor and normal tissue is determined voxel-wise by processing the DCE-MRI images by general tracer kinetic model (GTKM). The CFD model is applied to predict transport of two different types of liposomes (stealth and conventional) in tumors. The amount of accumulated liposomes is compared with accumulated free drug (doxorubicin) in the interstitial space. Simulation results indicate that stealth liposomes accumulate more and remain for longer periods of time in tumors as compared with conventional liposomes and free drug. The present model provides us a qualitative and quantitative examination on the transport and deposition of liposomes as well as free drugs in actual human brain tumors. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","CFD; DCE-MRI; doxorubicin; GTKM; human brain tumor; stealth and conventional liposome; Voxelized model","Brain; Brain models; Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Drug interactions; Fluids; Liposomes; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical models; Tissue; Chemotherapeutic drugs; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Computational model; Drugs; Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; GTKM; Human brain tumors; Tracer kinetic modeling; Tumors; doxorubicin; liposome; biological model; brain; brain tumor; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; human; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; transport at the cellular level; Biological Transport; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Computer Simulation; Doxorubicin; Humans; Liposomes; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Biological","Sinha, N.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT KanpurIndia; email: nsinha@iitk.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361241,,,"28796620","English","IEEE Trans.

However, in a hierarchical cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving and aggregating the data from their member sensor nodes and transmitting the aggregated data to the base station. Therefore, the proper selection of CHs plays vital role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient cluster head selection algorithm which is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) called PSO-ECHS. The algorithm is developed with an efficient scheme of particle encoding and fitness function. For the energy efficiency of the proposed PSO approach, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. We also present cluster formation in which non-cluster head sensor nodes join their CHs based on derived weight function. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs, varying number of sensor nodes and the CHs. The results are compared with some existing algorithms to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CH-selection; Energy consumption; NP-hard; Particle swarm optimization; Wireless sensor networks","Algorithms; Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; CH-selection; Cluster formations; Cluster-head selections; Efficient schemes; Fitness functions; Hierarchical clusters; NP-hard; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Rao, P.C.S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian School of MinesIndia; email: vasu.piit@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964318544

Multipath routing and energy consumption are the important factors to be considered in mobile ad hoc network as it provides a powerful tool for studying security aspects during data transmission. Advances in MANET technology have provided the availability of energy efficient reliable and multi path routing for intrusion tolerance with capability of identifying reliable routes, determining the best redundancy level to increase the operational lifetime of the network. Identifying a secured and energy efficient multipath routing for MANET represents the basic challenge during data transmission. In order to overcome such limitation, a hybrid method called as joint cost and secured node disjoint energy-efficient multipath routing (NDE-MR) is designed for MANET to reduce the energy consumption and execution time during the multipath routing and to improve security during data transfer. Node initialization initializes the mobile nodes with energy efficient model by obtaining the neighbor node data. Next, cost-based multipath route discovery model identifies the path with the least transmission cost through which data forwarding is made. Finally, security is achieved through node disjoint path model by splitting the data packets into different segments.

In a real-life decision-making situation, decision makers express their opinions often linguistically. Such linguistic expressions are then captured by fuzzy set theory and represented in the present study by heptagonal fuzzy numbers for analytic purpose. Firstly, the concept, the arithmetic operations and a centroid-based ranking method of symmetric heptagonal fuzzy numbers (symHFN) are introduced, and then, some operators are proposed for aggregating the linguistic information. Secondly, the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method used for group decision making is extended within the context of the proposed symHFNs to develop an algorithm for fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (FMCGDM) method. The proposed method incorporates an efficient computational technique which handles the degree of satisfaction of the decision maker in their judgement. SymHFNs are used to handle the linguistic evaluation and assessment of alternatives by the decision makers.

These two factors are one of the main reasons which are responsible for the loss of data packets and occurrence of congestion issue that networks are facing today. In order to overcome these issues, we propose an approach known as efficient and stable multipath routing in MANETs with congestion awareness. This approach is an extension work to our previous work where bandwidth and delay are considered during the routing. Here, in this approach, network estimates the residual energy and stability of the links in the network. While estimating the residual energy, it also considers the receiving energy and transmitting energy of the node. Then, stability of the link LET is estimated; this LET is obtained by using motion parameters (i.e. velocity, direction of the nodes). Based on these parameters, the network selects the path to transmit the data packets between the nodes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Congestion aware; Efficient; Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET); Stable multipath routing","Ad hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Telecommunication networks; Communication activities; Congestion-aware; Efficient; Energy efficient; Loss of data packets; Motion parameters; Multi path routing; Residual energy; Mobile ad hoc networks","Reddy, A.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ganapathy Engineering CollegeIndia; email: pratapareddy0762@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964310851

To improve QoS of cell edge users, energy efficiency and network utilization, cooperative communication can be used in heterogeneous networks.

In this paper, QoS improved energy efficient radio mode and optimal relay(Q-EERR) selection algorithm with heterogeneous relays is proposed, in which each relay node considers dynamic variation of individual radio networks and efficiently select radio mode using Boltzmann–Gibb’s learning algorithm to retransmit message with required QoS and optimized energy.

We first consider the superior selective reporting (SSR) scheme proposed earlier in the literature, and derive the achievable throughput, energy consumption and energy efficiency (EE) of the SSR scheme. We propose the maximization of EE for the SSR scheme as a multiple variable-based, non-convex optimization problem and provide approximations to reduce it to a quasi-convex optimization. We highlight that the errors due to these approximations are negligible. The SSR scheme is designed to optimize the energy consumption, which enhances the EE. Alternatively, EE can be improved by increasing the achievable throughput. Towards this end, we propose a novel variation on the SSR scheme called the opportunistic SSR (OSSR) scheme, and carry out its EE analysis. We study the tradeoff between performances of the SSR and OSSR schemes – the implicit tradeoff between achievable throughput and energy consumption, and discuss the regimes where OSSR is preferred over SSR and vice-versa, in terms of the EE. Also, through an extensive numerical study, we show that both schemes outperform the conventional schemes that employ the OR and AND fusion rules, in terms of energy efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Achievable throughput vs. energy consumption; Conventional spectrum sensing; Energy efficiency; Opportunistic superior selective reporting; Quasi-convex optimization","Cognitive radio; Convex optimization; Energy utilization; Optimization; Spectrum analysis; Throughput; Achievable throughputs; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio network; Conventional schemes; Nonconvex optimization; Opportunistic superior selective reporting; Performance analysis; Spectrum sensing; Energy efficiency","Kishore, R.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, BITS Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus, Zuari Nagar, India; email: p2012401@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028365758

However, security and energy efficiency in data collection and transmission in WSNs should be simultaneously considered for security challenges and to overcome limitation of WSNs.

The traditional two party architectures are not enough to present scalable solution to multi-server environment as user need to follow multiple registrations. On the other hands, multi-server authentication scheme resolves the repeated registration issue, where one time registration is enough to access the multiple servers of an architecture. To achieve efficient solution, Pippel et al. (Wirel Pers Commun 72(1):729–745, 2013) proposed a smart card based authentication scheme for multi-server environment. However, Li et al. (Int J Commun Syst 28(2):374–382, 2015) proved that Pippel et al.’s (2013) proposed scheme is insecure and proposed an improvement to overcome the drawbacks found in Pipple et al.’s scheme. In this paper, we show that Li et al.’s scheme also vulnerable to the known attacks, namely, password guessing attack, denial of service attack, privileged insider attack and known key secrecy attack. We then propose a secure multi-server authentication scheme to withstand the security pitfalls find in the Li et al.’s scheme while retaining the merits of Li et al.’s scheme. Using the widely accepted BAN logic we show that our scheme provides secure mutual authentication. In addition, we prove that our scheme is secure against all known attacks including password guessing attack, denial of service attack, privileged insider attack and known key secrecy attack.

Designing energy-aware routing protocol can significantly reduce energy consumption in WSNs. Grouping of sensor nodes into clusters is a proficient routing technique for reducing the energy depletion of the nodes in the WSN. In this work, a novel multi-branch tree based clustering approach is proposed to extend the lifetime of the WSNs. A number of branches and selection of cluster heads are performed based on the independent neighbour set properties of nodes. For this, a maximum of five branches constructed by the algorithm and these branches are grown to different direction using the nature of INS. In this approach, inter-cluster communication distance is drastically minimized and evenly distributed the energy consumption of nodes over the network. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the traditional existing methods in terms of cluster structure, nodes energy distribution and network lifetime through the extensive simulations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy Efficient routing; Load distribution; Multi-branch clustering; Wireless sensor networks","Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Ion beams; Network routing; Power management; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Unattended sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Energy aware routing protocols; Energy efficient routing; Extensive simulations; Intercluster communication; Load distributions; Multi-branch clustering; Reduce energy consumption; Unattended wireless sensor networks; Power management (telecommunication)","Alphonse, P.J.A.; Department of Computer Applications, National Institute of Technology (NIT)India; email: alphonse@nitt.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019660545

VoIP applications depend upon various speech codecs which vary in speech quality, bandwidth and computational requirements. The key challenges for improving the VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) is to use best codec by considering network traffic and selecting the optimal hardware. Hardware Calibration is a mechanism to aid service providers by selecting a suitable hardware for Call Manager to transmit different real-time based applications. The paper focuses on proposing a computational model which suggests the most suitable hardware for a specific load handling requirement. The selection of processor is done by taking into consideration the effect of different codecs when it takes calls per second as input and gives output as whichever hardware is recommended for Call Manager to handle different types of applications like Peer-To-Peer (P2P) application, Back-To-Back (BTB) application, enabling voice logging, etc. The emulations demonstrate that the proposed model is suitable for selection of hardware which provides better QoS and QoE for the transmission VoIP based real-time applications. Further, a multi-criteria decision-making method based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is also proposed to decide which hardware can be chosen as Call Manager. The results obtained from AHP are used to validate the outcome of the proposed computational model. The computational model is applicable only when the tests are run on particular systems and it suggests the best hardware among them for the particular offered load. However, to suggest the best configuration corresponding to the input load from the possible configurations available in the market, benchmarking is performed. A common scale model for hardware benchmark estimation particularly has been proposed for different scenarios. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","AHP; Benchmarking; codec; Quality of Service (QoS); RTP; VoIP","Analytic hierarchy process; Benchmarking; Calibration; Computation theory; Computational methods; Decision making; Hardware; Hierarchical systems; Internet telephony; Managers; Packet switching; Peer to peer networks; Voice/data communication systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); codec; Computational requirements; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Peer-to-peer application; Quality of experience (QoE); Voice over Internet protocol; VoIP; Quality of service","Kaushal, S.; University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University ChandigarhIndia; email: sakshi@pu.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030183957

Multimodal medical image fusion combines the images obtained from different modalities like Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and others. CT scan provides detailed information on bony structures whereas MRI scan provides details on soft tissues. Fusion of these images is useful for doctors to diagnose and plan treatment for patients. Various methods have been proposed during recent years for medical image fusion but these methods suffer from the issue of fusion performance due to different sensor modalities. In this paper, we validate that for such images, fusion performance can be improved using a learning based fusion scheme which uses training and testing phase by considering pixel wise processing of image. In order to improve image fusion performance, here we implement fuzzy logic type-2 based approaches for medical image fusion for CT and MRI images. Final fused image is achieved by applying rule based method which includes fuzzification inference, type reduction, and defuzzification of the input image. Experiments are conducted by applying fuzzy logic type-1, neural network, Neuro-fuzzy approach and fuzzy logic type-2 based fusion scheme. Performance of image fusion based on Fuzzy Logic Type-2 is compared with other state-of-art techniques using various performance metrics such as Mutual information, standard deviation and edge based similarity. Experimental results shows that fuzzy logic Type-2 performs better when compared to neural network based approach. © 2016 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; image fusion; neuro-fuzzy","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; Positron emission tomography; Multimodal medical images; Mutual informations; Network-based approach; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Performance metrics; Positron emission tomography (PET); Training and testing; Computerized tomography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053698,,,"English","Int.

Hence, the network consumes more energy which is the main and challenging issue in WSNs. Since the sensor is operating under battery, recharging is impossible and hence the lifetime of each sensor is an important issue. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new and efficient techniques to extend the network lifetime. In this paper, a new delay constrained energy efficient routing technique is proposed for performing effective routing in WSNs. This approach introduces a delay constraint based reliable routing approach which reduces the energy consumption by constructing efficient clusters without increasing the end-to-end delay. Moreover, the proposed technique called the rule based clustering for routing model provides better performance in terms of network lifetime than the other existing techniques since they consume more energy during the formation of clusters and finding the shortest path. Moreover, additional overhead on the cluster head selection is tackled also using rules in this proposed model in an efficient manner by building balanced clusters. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it extends the lifetime of the network and increases the throughput, energy efficiency, link quality and scalability. The experimental verification of this technique has been carried out using MATLAB simulations and proved that this model increases the packet delivery rate, network performance and reduces the delay and energy consumption. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cluster head; Data gathering; Depth First Search routing; Energy efficiency; TED based clustering; Wireless sensor network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Based clustering; Cluster head; Cluster-head selections; Constrained energy; Data gathering; Depth first search; Experimental verification; Matlab simulations; Wireless sensor networks","Velvizhy, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University, CEG Campus, India; email: velvizhy@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029789284

For prolonged network operational time, energy conservation is a critical issue in routing protocol design in ad-hoc wireless networks. Regardless of the energy saving issues, the conventional AODV routing protocol uses smallest hop count as the main metric to calculate the best path for routing the data packets to its destination. Major source of energy cost in a routing protocol is the energy used to transmit the data packets. For this purpose, we consider the problem of adjusting the transmission power of the nodes to an optimal power level and incorporate low power consumption strategies into the routing protocol through upward information flow cross-layer model between MAC Layer and Network Layer. Using QualNet 5.2 as the simulation tool, we evaluate the performance of our proposed energy efficient cross-layer design to AODV, which is named as Cross Layer Energy Efficient AODV (CLEE-AODV). We investigate by implementing the required changes in the route discovery process using cross-layer approach in the AODV.

But like other wireless networks WSN is also prone to adversary interventions. So the researchers are addressing this issue to make routing protocols secure for communication. But due to the severe resource constraints on sensor nodes like limited battery life and limited storage capacity prevents the traditional complex security mechanisms to be employed on the sensor nodes. In this paper we propose a new routing algorithm called Secure Energy Aware Multipath Routing with Key Management (SEAM-KM) in Wireless Sensor Network. This protocol focuses on using a base station as the central control block for all kinds of computation like shortest path selection, routing table generation, Updating the routing table and distribution of pair wise keys among the sensor nodes and the base station. Leaving the energy consuming computations to be performed by the base station, the lifetime of the sensor nodes can be prolonged. Moreover distribution of pair wise keys among sensor nodes provides security among sensor nodes and also increases the resilience of the network. This protocol is resistive to some of the specific attacks which rely on forming attractive routes to lure the sensor nodes to communicate through the already compromised nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","Dijkstra's algorithm; Energy efficiency; Key Management; Multipath routing; Security","Base stations; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Network security; Power management; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; Critical environment; Dijkstra's algorithms; Key management; Multi path routing; Resource Constraint; Security; Security mechanism; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

This paper presents a novel energy-aware load balancing technique that uses an amalgamation of the Artificial Bee Colony and the Firefly algorithms. This technique aspires to balance the load of the cloud infrastructure while trying to maximize the energy efficiency through the efficient usage of the cloud resources. The proposed load balancing technique has been executed in the actual data center of BSNL, Chandigarh. The competence of the proposed technique is exhibited by comparing it with the three standard techniques namely RR, FFD and ACO. The experimentation results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed the existing approach, followed in the data center and the other two approaches. It saved 40.47% of the average energy consumption, which is accomplished by improving CPU utilization level by 49.68%, memory utilization level by 24.41%, reducing VM migrations by 63.10% and saving 53.21% of nodes. The improved results illustrate that the proposed technique effectively balances the load, thereby curtailing the energy consumption and enhancing the performance levels of the cloud data center. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Energy-aware; Green computing; Load balancing; Resource utilization; Virtual machine migration","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Metals; Optimization; Power management; Resource allocation; Artificial bee colonies; Cloud data centers; Cloud infrastructures; Empirical evaluations; Energy aware; Load balancing technique; Resource utilizations; Virtual machine migrations; Green computing","Kansal, N.J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: nidhi.kavya@thapar.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029601415

Hybrid energy-efficient distributed (HEED) protocol is one of the prominent clustering protocol in WSNs. However, it has few shortcomings, i.e., cluster heads (CHs) variation in consecutive rounds, more work load on CHs, uneven energy dissipation by sensor nodes, and formation of hot spots in network. By resolving these issues, one can enhance HEED capabilities to a greater extent. We have designed variants of Optimized HEED (OHEED) protocols named as HEED-1 Tier chaining (HEED1TC), HEED-2 Tier chaining (HEED2TC), ICHB-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICOH1TC), ICHB-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICOH2TC), ICHB-FL-based OHEED-1 Tier chaining (ICFLOH1TC), and ICHB-FL-based OHEED-2 Tier chaining (ICFLOH2TC) protocols. In HEED1TC and HEED2TC protocols, we have used chain-based intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication in HEED, respectively, for even load balancing among sensor nodes and to avoid more work load on CHs. Furthermore, for appropriate cluster formation, minimizing CHs variation in consecutive rounds and reducing complex uncertainties, we have used bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA)-inspired proposed intelligent CH selection based on BFOA (ICHB) algorithm for CH selection in ICOH1TC and ICOH2TC protocols. Likewise, in ICFLOH1TC and ICFLOH2TC protocols, we have used novel fuzzy set of rules additionally for CH selection to resolve the hot spots problem, proper CH selection covering whole network, and maximizing the network lifetime to a great extent. The simulation results showed that proposed OHEED protocols are able to handle above-discussed issues and provided far better results in comparison to HEED. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany","Bacterial foraging optimization algorithm; Clustering; Fuzzy logic system; HEED; Load balancing; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks","Computer circuits; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Fuzzy logic; High energy electron diffraction; Optimization; Resource allocation; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Bacterial foraging optimization; Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA); Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Clustering; Fuzzy logic system; Intercluster communication; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Clustering algorithms","Gupta, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: cseprateek@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029597015

Variety of computational intelligence techniques including evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, artificial immune systems and recently, artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic have been applied for efficient clustering in WSNs. Due to ease of use and adaptive nature, ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs. However, its search equation contributes to its insufficiency due to comparably poor exploitation cycle and requirement of certain control parameters. Thus, we propose an improved artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve exploitation capabilities of existing metaheuristic. Further, to enhance the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student’s t-distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store and therefore increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements; moreover, the use of first-of-its-kind compact Student’s t-distribution makes it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Additionally, an energy-efficient clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is presented, which inherits the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads along with an optimal base station location to improve energy efficiency in WSNs.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid adder architecture that precomputes the simultaneous generation of pseudo carry signals by exploiting the symmetry of 3X multiple and the final carry generation using Ling prefix network. As the Ling adder in the carry path reduces the complexity, the proposed adder results in significant improvement in the power delay product ((Formula presented.)25–55%) compared to state of the art 64 bit adders. This adder decreases the number of logic gates in the critical path, leading to a reduction in static power consumption.

One of the methods to solve this problem is to activate only a few sensors which satisfy the coverage constraints. This can be done by partitioning a set of all sensors into many subsets or sensor covers such that each sensor cover satisfies the coverage constraints and activating them subsequently which leads to increase the network lifetime. A memetic algorithm is proposed in this paper for the Q-Coverage problem where each target can be covered by one or more sensors.

In clustered WSNs, network is partitioned into set of clusters, each having a coordinator called cluster head (CH), which collects data from its cluster members and forwards it to the base station (BS) via other CHs. Clustered WSNs often suffer from the hot spot problem where CHs closer to the BS die much early because of high energy consumption contributed by the data forwarding load. Such death of nodes results coverage holes in the network very early. In most applications of WSNs, coverage preservation of the target area is a primary measure of quality of service. Considering the energy limitation of sensors, most of the clustering algorithms designed for WSNs focus on energy efficiency while ignoring the coverage requirement. In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm that uses fuzzy logic to establish a trade-off between the energy efficiency and coverage requirement. This algorithm considers both energy and coverage parameters during cluster formation to maximize the coverage preservation of target area. Further, to deal with hot spot problem, it forms unequal sized clusters such that more CHs are available closer to BS to share the high data forwarding load. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is compared with some of the well-known existing algorithms under different network scenarios. The simulation results validate the superiority of our algorithm in network lifetime, coverage preservation, and energy efficiency.

The nodes in the network are resource constrained in nature and faces several challenges for producing the data from the unfriendly environment. Large amount of data is generated from WSN and suffers from data fault, inaccuracy and inconsistency. To increase the reliability of application, several data trust management schemes are introduced to ensure the trustworthiness of data in decision making process. Apart from these schemes, in the absence of ground truth, sensor data models are used to find the trustiness of the sensor data. The data generated from the simulation of data model is used as a metric to evaluate the degree of trustiness of sensor data. The existing sensor data models suffer from high energy consumption for data trustiness detection and it becomes inaccurate when the data fault rate is high. In this paper, we are proposing an energy efficient sensor data model for evaluating the sensor data trustworthiness and reconstruct the sensor data in case of any data loss and data fault. The proposed data model is hybrid in nature and it works at low level sensor nodes and also at sink node. Results show that the proposed data model is able to detect the untrustworthy data and gives remedy to untrustworthy and missing data with the help of data reconstruction in an energy efficient way and it is able to identify the events in reliable fashion. © 2017 IEEE.","Data Models; Data Reconstruction; Data Trustworthiness; Wireless sensor networks","Big data; Data privacy; Data structures; Decision making; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network security; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Data reconstruction; Data Trustworthiness; Decision making process; Environmental parameter; High energy consumption; Sensor data modeling; Sensor data models; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Data communication systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049059,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In MCC, transfer of thread execution to high end servers allows the processing of those jobs which demand more resources on the mobile equipment. Hence, implementing the application with stumpy cost, least overhead and non-obtrusive relocation is a demanding research area in MCC. Many scheduling mechanisms have been proposed so far to balance the load between the given set of mobile servers, but it is found to be NP-Hard problem. Therefore, evolutionary techniques are required to balance the load among mobile servers. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been verified to be fine by jumble up the key values, but it becomes unsuccessful to strengthen the exploration in the rising areas. In Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), local exploration technique is implemented continually to evaluate optimistic outcomes in neighborhood to attain local best solution. But VNS is still prone to premature convergence traps only because of limited search capability. Therefore hybridization with non-global finding techniques may conquer the limitations and guide the dominant search mechanisms to some extent.

The design of a non-zero-entry Single Symbol Decodable Square Complex Orthogonal, Space Time Block Codes (STBC) for 16 antennas is proposed first. This multi-channel facility is then exploited for transmission of CS measurements, which at the receiver side, undergo Robbins–Monro (RM) method, a non-parametric stochastic approach for predicting the unobserved spaces from the observed ones through recursive filtering. Similar study is also done using a relaxed convex optimization of the basis pursuit algorithm, a parametric based approach.

LAMCS schedules mixed task set where hard and soft real-time tasks co-exist. It takes care of all the deadline constraints of hard real-time tasks and response time constraints of soft real-time tasks. LAMCS achieves energy efficiency by considering static and dynamic energy consumptions. The static energy saving is achieved by shutting down the core(s) for a duration greater than a threshold whenever it is feasible. The dynamic energy saving is achieved by applying DVFS whenever possible. DVFS lengthens the execution intervals by decreasing the voltage and frequency of the core which may reduce the chances of shutdown. This increases energy consumption because of other factors such as preemptions, cache flushes etc. LAMCS minimizes these factors using procrastination. The energy efficiency is achieved while satisfying all the scheduling constraints of mixed task set. It tries to achieve minimum response time for all the soft real-time tasks and meets all deadlines of hard real-time tasks.

It appears that no one has found models using Center of Area (CoA) or Center of Gravity (CoG) defuzzification method. Although there have been some works reported to deal with modeling of fuzzy controllers via Centroid method, all of them have in fact used CoS method only. In this paper, for the first time mathematical models of the simplest Mamdani type fuzzy Proportional Integral (PI)/Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers via CoG defuzzification are presented. L-type and Γ-type membership functions over different Universes of Discourse (UoDs) are considered for the input variables. L-type, Π-type and Γ-type membership functions are considered for the output variable. Three linear fuzzy control rules relating all four input fuzzy sets to three output fuzzy sets are chosen. Two triangular norms namely Algebraic Product (AP) and Minimum (Min), Maximum (Max) triangular co-norm, and two inference methods, Larsen Product (LP) and Mamdani Minimum (MM), are used. Properties of the models are studied. Stability analysis of closed-loop systems containing one of these controller models in the loop is done using the Small Gain theorem. Since digital controllers are implemented using digital processors, computational and memory requirements of these fuzzy controllers and conventional (nonfuzzy) controllers are compared. A rough estimate of the computational time taken by the digital computer while implementing any of these discrete-time fuzzy controllers is given. Two nonlinear plants are considered to show the superiority of the simplest fuzzy controller obtained using CoA or CoG defuzzification method over the simplest fuzzy controller obtained using CoS method and reported recently.

Further in this paper, we have re-defined the medium access protocol for cluster heads. The proposed medium access protocol is dependent upon the data traffic at the Cluster heads. Cluster heads with high traffic are given preference to access the channel and cluster head(s) having low traffic are made to wait for comparatively higher back-off time. By giving more time to cluster heads with lower initial data to collect more data, energy efficiency of the system is increased and contention losses are decreased due to reduction in number of transmissions between cluster heads and sink.

Initially, each particle (i.e. mobile node) movement in a network is controlled by its local best known position in the search space (i.e. geographic location). The PSO permits all the particles in the network to communicate with the other particles with minimum energy. The particle which has the better global best function is selected for energy efficient routing based on the fitness value. Therefore the entire particles share the similar best position to optimize the network resources. Thereby, the PS-ROGR technique prolong the lifetime of the network with minimum energy utilization. Simulation is carried out on the factors such as packet delivery ratio, average end to end delay, energy consumption and network lifetime. Thus, the proposed PS-ROGR technique improves the network lifetime by 22% and reduces the average end to end delay by 46%. Then, the packet delivery ratio is enhanced up to 11% and energy consumption is minimized to 16% with the help of proposed PS-ROGR technique. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Geographic routing; MANET; Network lifetime; Particle swarm optimization; Resource optimization","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power management (telecommunication); Resource allocation; Average end-to-end delays; Energy efficient routing; Geographic routing; Geographic routing protocols; Geographical locations; MANET; Network lifetime; Resource optimization; Mobile ad hoc networks","Nallusamy, C.; K S Rangasamy College of TechnologyIndia; email: nallu80@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",1383469X,,,,"English","Mobile Networks Appl",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028775108

In MANET, application security can be provided using trust management, key management, firewalls and intrusion detection. Moreover, it is often necessary to communicate secret information in military applications where urgent and reliable communication is more important. However, most of the existing routing algorithms do not focus on the energy and security aspects while routing. Since energy and security are important criteria for reliable communication in MANET, it is essential to consider the energy and security aspects in routing algorithms. The prevention of security attacks on routing protocols and cluster based routing automatically reduces the energy consumption. Hence, we propose a new secured routing protocol called Cluster based Energy Efficient Secure Routing Algorithm (CEESRA) in this paper which is energy efficient and uses cluster based routing in which the trust scores on nodes are used to detect the intruders effectively. This routing algorithm reduces the Denial of Service attacks more efficiently by using intelligent agents for effective decision making in routing. From the experiments conducted with this trust based secured routing algorithm, it has been observed that this proposed routing algorithm not only enhances the security but also reduces the energy consumption and routing delay. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficiency; Intrusion detection; Malicious nodes; Mobile Ad Hoc networks; Secure routing; Trust score","Clustering algorithms; Computer viruses; Decision making; Denial-of-service attack; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent agents; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Military applications; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Application security; Cluster-based routing; Energy efficient routing; Malicious nodes; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Reliable communication; Secure routing; Trust scores; Mobile security","Muthurajkumar, S.; Department of Information Science and Technology, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna UniversityIndia; email: muthurajkumarss@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018255074

The statistics provides a generalized line-of-sight propagation model which includes fading models like Rayleigh, Nakagami, Rician as special cases. We restrict our analysis to collinear relay placement, i.e. the relay node (Rn) is on the same straight line between the source node (Sn) and the destination node (Dn). In the non-cooperative mode, Dn accepts only the two-hop transmission via Rn and discards any direct signal that may be available from Sn. On the other hand, in the cooperative mode, Dn accepts both the replicas and combine them following either selection combining (SC) or maximum ratio combining (MRC). It is interesting to see that such cooperation does not always lead to energy saving, especially for small Sn- Dn separation. Also, worth mentioning the fact that MRC may not be optimal from the energy efficiency perspective, and SC can outperform MRC under certain channel conditions. In our paper, we also studied how parameters like spectral efficiency (R), path loss exponent (n), and fading parameters (κ, μ) affect the optimal relay placement location. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficiency; fading; Maximum ratio combining; Relay placement; Selection combining","Communication channels (information theory); Energy conservation; Fading channels; Location; Adaptive decode and forwards; Channel conditions; Line-of-sight propagation; Maximum ratio combining; Optimal relay placements; Relay placements; Selection combining; Spectral efficiencies; Energy efficiency","Ghosh, B.; IT Department, FIEMIndia; email: biswanerist@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018263468

Invariably, in all these WSN architectures, devising suitable algorithms for the efficient network resources utilization has been a challenging task. In certain events driven scenarios, random arrival pattern of queries generation; their geographical distribution (spatial aspect) and generation rate (temporal aspect) are hard to predict precisely. However, these phenomenons could be appropriately modelled using probabilistic framework while yielding adequate accuracy. Usually, in adopted probabilistic models, the associated control parameters are treated as crisp numbers, which fail to encompass uncertainties that are inevitably associated with the modeled parameters. To include impact of such uncertainties, we propose a modified Poisson PMF expressions in that dependency on spatial and temporal aspects is incorporated based on interval concepts. The paper also validates the dynamic fuzzy c-means algorithm as the most efficient clusters formation scheme. Sink node is an important entity/interface between end users and remotely located sensor nodes. To exploit implications of sink nodes attributes, three different case studies are presented.

Several potential security risks arise while protecting data and providing access control over the data. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channels, wireless networks are often vulnerable to various possible known attacks. Therefore, designing a secure and efficient authentication scheme in the global mobility network (GLOMONET) environment becomes a challenging task to the researchers. In recent years, several user authentication schemes for roaming services in GLOMONET have been proposed. However, most of them are either vulnerable to various known attacks or they are inefficient. Most recently, Zhao et al. proposed an anonymous authentication scheme for roaming service in GLOMONET (Zhao et al. in Wireless Personal Communications 78:247–269, 2014) and they claimed that their scheme can withstand all possible known attacks. In this paper, Zhao et al.’s scheme is revisited, and it is shown that their scheme fails to provide strong user anonymity when the session-specific temporary information are revealed to an adversary. Further, their scheme does not protect replay attack, offline password guessing attack and privileged-insider attack. In addition, there is no provision for revocation and re-registration mechanism in their scheme and also there exists design flaw in their schemeu. Moreover, another recently proposed Memon et al.’s scheme (Memon et al. in Wireless Personal Communications 84:1487–1508, 2015) fails to protect the privileged-insider attack. Thus, there is a great need to provide security enhancement of their schemes in order to apply in practical applications. The proposed scheme withstands the security weaknesses found in Zhao et al.’s scheme and Memon et al.’s scheme. Through the rigorous formal and informal security analysis, it is shown that the proposed scheme has the ability to tolerate various known attacks. In addition, the proposed scheme is simulated using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool and the simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme is secure. The proposed scheme is also efficient in computation and communication as compared to Zhao et al.’s scheme and other related schemes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Authentication; AVISPA; BAN logic; Global mobility networks; Key agreement; Roaming service; Security; User anonymity","Access control; Aluminum; Authentication; Cellular radio systems; Computation theory; Cryptography; Personal communication systems; Security systems; AVISPA; BAN logic; Global mobility network; Key agreement; Roaming services; Security; User anonymity; Network security","Odelu, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: odelu.vanga@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019616129

Researchers have explored several designs of QCA-based reversible logic circuits, but still not much work has been reported on QCA-based reversible binary subtractors. The low power dissipation and high circuit density of QCA pledge the energy-efficient design of logic circuit at a nano-scale level. However, the necessity of too many logic gates and detrimental garbage outputs may limit the functionality of a QCA-based logic circuit.

Over the period of time, researchers have proposed various multiplier designs in order to get high speed. Vedic multiplier is considered as one of the low power multiplier along with high speed as compared with traditional array and booth multipliers. Vedic Multiplier contains a total of sixteen algorithms/sutras for predominantly logical operations. This research focuses on thermal aspects and energy efficiency of wireless communications systems with the thermal aware low power design of Vedic Multiplier. Temperature plays an important role on the performance of any device. The primary purpose of this research is to enhance the thermal stability of the wireless communications. Energy efficient IO standards are used to decrease the power dissipation of Vedic Multiplier and that eventually decrease power dissipation of wireless communications systems. In order to study the effect of different process technology (40, 65, 90 nm) on our design, a novel design is implemented on 40, 65 and 90 nm based FPGA. In this work, we are integrating thermal aware design approach for energy efficient Vedic Multiplier on various FPGA using LVCMOS and HSTL I/O standard. LVCMOS is an acronym for Low Voltage Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor and HSTL is an acronym for High Speed Transceiver Logic. In this Vedic Multiplier, we are using three LVCMOS I/O standard and nine HSTL I/O standard. In order to test the thermal sustainability of our Vedic Multiplier design, we are testing it in three different room temperatures i.e. 20, 30, and 40 °C. Using LVCMOS25, there is 12.99, 19.23 and 10.28% reduction in power dissipation on 90, 65 and 40 nm FPGAs respectively.

It can over-perform conventional computers with its inherent massively parallelism nature. On the other hand, proper synthesis of reversible circuit is a well researched computing problem in recent days for its extremely low power consumption (ideally zero) and inherent reversible nature of reversible logic. Minimum synthesis of a reversible truth table means finding the reversible circuit made up of reversible gates satisfying given truth table with minimum cost. But none of the approaches running on conventional computers can perform minimum synthesis till date without using brute-force DFS tree search. On the other hand, DFS tree-search approach can not be reasonably implemented for larger circuits as searching a DFS tree is extremely costly on a conventional computer. In this paper, first, a procedure to search a DFS tree in constant time has been proposed to run on a DNA computer. Second, another procedure has also been proposed to apply a reversible gate on a reversible truth table in linear time that can be used to generate a DFS tree library. Finally, the generated library can then be searched in constant time to get minimum reversible circuit given a reversible truth table. An analytical feasibility study has been done and a novel methodology has been developed that can extend enormous scope of future research in this area. To the best of authors’ knowledge this is a pioneering approach to bridge reversible computing and DNA computing. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","DNA computing; Minimal reversible circuit synthesis; Natural computing","Calculations; Computation theory; DNA; Logic gates; Logic Synthesis; Low power electronics; Reconfigurable hardware; Conventional computers; DNA-computing; Feasibility studies; Low-power consumption; Natural Computing; Novel methodology; Reversible circuits; Reversible Computing; Computer circuits; DNA; Article; experimental study; feasibility study; knowledge; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical parameters; methodology; molecular biology; molecular genetics; synthesis","Ghosal, P.; Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, ShibpurIndia; email: p_ghosal@it.iiests.ac.in",,"Springer Netherlands",15677818,,NCAOA,,"English","Nat.

This would be much more powerful and general purpose when combined with other existing well-known algorithmic solutions that exist for conventional computing architectures using a suitable ALU. Thus, a specifically designed DNA Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that can address operations suitable for both domains can mitigate the gap between these two. An ALU must be able to perform all possible logic operations, including NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and XNOR; compare, shift etc., integer and floating point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In this paper, design of an ALU has been proposed using sticker-based DNA model with experimental feasibility analysis. Novelties of this paper may be in manifold. First, the integer arithmetic operations performed here are 2s complement arithmetic, and the floating point operations follow the IEEE 754 floating point format, resembling closely to a conventional ALU. Also, the output of each operation can be reused for any next operation. So any algorithm or program logic that users can think of can be implemented directly on the DNA computer without any modification. Second, once the basic operations of sticker model can be automated, the implementations proposed in this paper become highly suitable to design a fully automated ALU. Third, proposed approaches are easy to implement. Finally, these approaches can work on sufficiently large binary numbers. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","DNA ALU; DNA computing; sticker model","Bioinformatics; Calculations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Digital arithmetic; DNA; Electron tubes; Energy efficiency; Logic circuits; Algorithm design and analysis; Computational model; DNA-computing; Parallel processing; Search problem; Sticker models; Computer architecture; DNA; biological model; chemical model; chemistry; computer aided design; computer simulation; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; feasibility study; molecular computer; molecular model; signal processing; ultrastructure; Computer Simulation; Computer-Aided Design; Computers, Molecular; DNA; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Feasibility Studies; Models, Chemical; Models, Genetic; Models, Molecular; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Ghosal, P.; Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: p_ghosal@it.iiests.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361241,,,"28715334","English","IEEE Trans.

Most existing methods approach this problem by taking steps obtained from approximating the objective by a quadratic approximation that is decoupled at the individual variable level. These methods are designed for multicore systems where communication costs are low. They are inefficient on systems such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity machines where communication costs are substantial. In this paper we design a distributed algorithm for l1 regularization that is much better suited for such systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to support these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is to do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function within each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that is matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer iterations, thus yielding a faster overall method. Distributed Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Southwell greedy schemes are used for choosing variables to update in each step. We establish global convergence theory for our algorithm, including Q-linear rate of convergence. Experiments on two benchmark problems show our method to be much faster than existing methods. © 2017 Mahajan, Keerthi and Sundararajan.","Distributed learning; l1 regularization","Computation theory; Costs; Distributed computer systems; Optimization; Bench-mark problems; Block coordinate descents; Distributed learning; Global conver-gence; L1 regularizations; Linear rate of convergences; Objective functions; Quadratic approximation; Cost benefit analysis",,,"Microtome Publishing",15324435,,,,"English","J.

Localization system is required to provide position information to the nodes. Traditional localization method involves utilizing global positioning system (GPS) in all the nodes. It gives high precision, but is suitable only for outdoor environment. The energy consumption is also high. Recently, localization of each node was done using range-based and range-free techniques. Use of movable beacons to assist the nodes of a WSN in estimating their positions, has been proposed. A beacon is a node that is aware of its position (with GPS) and it will move in and around the sensor field. This beacon can be a robot. This paper gives an overview of the different localization techniques in WSN and an obstacle avoidance path planning localization algorithms, based on V Curve. This algorithm avoids the use of GPS in all sensor nodes except for the mobile beacon. And also in real-time environments, if a beacon is moving, it will be highly influenced by the obstacles. To avoid this obstacle, back-tracking technique is used. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Localization; Mobile anchor; Obstacle avoidance; Path planning; Wireless sensor network","Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global positioning system; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Localization; Localization algorithm; Localization method; Localization technique; Mobile anchors; Outdoor environment; Position information; Real-time environment; Wireless sensor networks","Magadevi, N.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Anna UniversityIndia; email: magadevin5@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028587669

These sensor nodes sense the changes in physical parameters from the sensing range and forward the information to the sink nodes or the base station. Since sensor nodes are driven with limited power batteries, prolonging the network lifetime is difficult and very expensive, especially for hostile locations. Therefore, routing protocols for WSN must strategically distribute the dissipation of energy, so as to increase the overall lifetime of the system. Current research trends from areas, such as from Internet of Things and fog computing use sensors as the source of data. Therefore, energy-efficient data routing in WSN is still a challenging task for real-Time applications. Hierarchical grid-based routing is an energy-efficient method for routing of data packets. This method divides the sensing area into grids and is advantageous in wireless sensor networks to enhance network lifetime. The network is partitioned into virtual equal-sized grids. The proposed mode-switched grid-based routing protocol for WSN selects one node per grid as the grid head. The routing path to the sink is established using grid heads. Grid heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternately. Therefore, not all grid heads take part in the routing process at the same time. This saves energy in grid heads and improves the network lifetime. The proposed method builds a routing path using each active grid head which leads to the sink. For handling the mobile sink movement, the routing path changes only for some grid head nodes which are nearer to the grid, in which the mobile sink is currently positioned. Data packets generated at any source node are routed directly through the data disseminating grid head nodes on the routing path to the sink. © 2013 IEEE.","energy efficiency; grid head; grid-based routing; mobile sink; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Grid Head; Grid-based routing; Hierarchical Grid; Internet of Things (IOT); Mobile sinks; Network lifetime; Physical parameters; Real-time application; Wireless sensor networks","Puthal, D.; Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology SydneyAustralia; email: deepak.puthal@uts.edu.au",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028722885

We utilize the Karnik-Mendel (KM) algorithm to estimate the centroid boundary of a multi-dimensional footprint of uncertainty (FOU). We deal with two-dimensional (2-D) fuzzy sets as we can visualize the FOU using 3-D plots, thus making the illustration of the methods simple. However, the basic idea can be extended to multiple dimensions. We give a formal definition of the centroid boundary of a 2-D IT2 fuzzy membership function (FMF) and propose two methods for its estimation. The first method computes embedded type-1 (T1) FSs whose centroids constitute the centroid boundary. We obtain the embedded sets by producing slices of the domain using different sets of parallel planes and then apply the KM algorithm over each slice, to obtain 'embedded-curves.' For the second method, we approximate our first method by restricting embedded-curves to be 'embedded-lines' thus enhancing computational speed.

With the increased number of handovers, networks scanned for decision making and the negotiations for connectivity become too large. To improve their efficiency, only the qualified numbers among all the reachable access points are chosen as candidate networks for decision making. Handover decision is performed by choosing the appropriate time and the most suitable access network according to user preferences.

Increased media reporting of medical malpractices and errors lead to hospitals taking corrective action and improve the quality of medical services with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skill that they provide. Questionnaire with 1180 variables was applied to 1000 randomly chosen patients from various hospitals in Metro cities, India. 60.4% respondents was male and 39. 6% was female. The model of Cultivation Theory can be used to measure the influence of media and creating awareness of medical errors in the Medical sector. In order to evaluate the Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) was used for data analysis. The absolute fit indices of the sample data reveals that the proposed model is fit, by way of satisfying the recommended values. The findings show that The Media crates awareness of the medical malpractices, has started hitting the headlines in the daily news bulletins of the television media. The quantitative sampling shows that the valuable family doctor system has to come back. The patient's medical history has to be placed on the cloud platform with ICT skill, so that from any corner of the world it could be viewed, analyzed by the doctor who treats the patient. This study concludes that the doctors have to stand by their medical oath they have taken instead of standing on the so called investments they made to attain the medical knowledge imparted. The world media is waiting eagerly for the homecoming of the service oriented medical doctors and hospitals through ICT. © 2017 IEEE.","Cyber crime; Internet Crime; Law; Structural Equation Model and Media Awareness","Crime; Hospitals; Corrective actions; Cyber-crimes; Indian subcontinents; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet crimes; Recommended values; Structural equation modeling; Structural equations modeling (SEM); Computation theory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

Denoising MRI images is an important preprocessing step required in many of the automatic computed aided-diagnosis systems in neuroscience. Rician noise occurs in the MRI image during acquisition. Non local mean filter is used for denoising. But the parameter selection is not optimized. The proposed method removal of rician noise in MRI images using bilateral filter by fuzzy trapezoidal membership function improves the denoising efficiency at various noise variances, preserves the fine structures and edges. The fuzzy weights were obtained with the statistical features such as local mean (μi) and global mean (μg) by constructing trapezoidal membership function. Bilateral filter is used to preserve the edges by smoothening the noises in MRI image and preserves the structural information. Local filter preserves the edges. MRI images are restored by multiplying its corresponding fuzzy weight with the restored image of local order filter and bilateral filter. Experiments on simulated and real MRI data were done at different noise levels by the proposed method and the existing methods. The result shows that the proposed method restores the image in better visual quality and can be well utilized for diagnostic purpose at both low and high densities of rician noise. © 2017 IEEE.","bilateral filter; denoising; fuzzy logic; magnetic resonance imaging; membership function; rician noise","Bandpass filters; Computation theory; Diagnosis; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy logic; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Membership functions; Neurology; Nonlinear filtering; Restoration; Bilateral filters; Computed-aided diagnosis; De-noising; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Non-local mean filters; rician noise; Structural information; Trapezoidal membership functions; Image denoising",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

When the size of the single computing element is reduced then the speed can be improved and also if the power dissipation is reduced then the heat dissipation will be less.

The Reversible Logic is considered to be the promising technology to the future Quantum computer technologies. The Reversible Logic gates prune the power dissipation to a larger extent.

Recently, a variety of two-factor multiserver authentication protocols have been developed. It is observed that the existing RSA-based multiserver authentication protocols are not suitable in terms of computation complexities and security attacks. To provide lower complexities and security resilience against known attacks, this article proposes a two-factor (password and smart-card) user authentication protocol with the RSA cryptosystem for multiserver environments. The comprehensive security discussion proved that the known security attacks are eliminated in our protocol. Besides, our protocol supports session key agreement and mutual authentication between the application server and the user. We analyze the proof of correctness of the mutual authentication and freshness of session key using the BAN logic model. The experimental outcomes obtained through simulation of the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) S/W show that our protocol is secured. We consider the computation, communication, and storage costs and the comparative explanations show that our protocol is flexible and efficient compared with protocols. In addition, our protocol offers security resilience against known attacks and provides lower computation complexities than existing protocols. Additionally, the protocol offers password change facility to the authorized user. © 2017 Ruhul Amin et al.",,"Access control; Computation theory; Network security; Smart cards; Transportation; Application Servers; Authentication protocols; Authentication systems; Computation complexity; Multi-server environment; Mutual authentication; Proof of correctness; User authentication protocols; Authentication","Islam, S.K.H.; Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: hafi786@gmail.com",,"Hindawi Limited",19390114,,,,"English","Secur.

In this paper, a multi-objective fractional gravitational search algorithm is proposed to find the optimal cluster head for energy efficient routing protocol in IoT network. To extend the lifetime of the node, the Fractional Gravitational Search Algorithm (FGSA) is proposed to find out the optimal cluster head node iteratively in the IoT network model. The cluster head node is selected in FGSA that is evaluated by the fitness function using multiple objectives such as distance, delay, link lifetime and energy, termed as multi-objective FGSA (MOFGSA). The simulation results and performance is analyzed using MATLAB implementation. The performance is compared with existing algorithms like Artificial Bee Colony, Gravitational Search Algorithm and multi-particle swarm immune cooperative algorithm.

For a long-term deployment of a network, energy efficiency is the most important design criteria. For achieving energy efficiency and overall improvement in network performance, a new approach of cross-layer protocol stack design is being explored by researchers. In this work, a cross-layer protocol stack has been developed for a three-dimensional Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN) that can be used for a long-term monitoring of ocean column. The proposed stack with cross-layer design combines physical layer, data link layer, network layer protocols along with time-synchronization, clustering and power level management.

Underwater Smart things are deployed to facilitate the discovery of unexplored regions of ocean. Unique characteristics of underwater wireless sensor networks pose many constraints in transmission of data packets and energy efficient routing is one of them. Motivated by the significance of less costly energy efficient routing protocol, we propose energy efficient chain based routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks (E-CBCCP). While keeping in view the complex features of underwater dynamics, dynamic network topology and node mobility, energy of the cluster heads (CHs), relay nodes (RNs) and cluster coordinators (CCOs) has been considered during the transmission of data and role of the CHs, CCOs and RNs is changed after some time duration to maintain the load on the nodes. Distance based communication is based on the location aware nodes and can be used in monitoring domains during steady state but in dynamic state, location free communication is required therefore RN communication is based on hop to hop.

These energy efficient lamps produce high total harmonic distortion but operate at high power factor. Few samples of commercial energy saving lamps are tested with different combinations of control gears and their performances are compared. The electrical and photometrical parameters are presented to verify the effectiveness of the lamp-ballast combinations. The result shows that although these lamps provide higher luminous efficacy, higher illumination but also high level of THD.

Such antenna systems can be reconfigured in space for variable antenna footprint, and hence can be utilized for signal transmission to different geographic locations. Due to quasi-static shape change requirements, coupled with the demand of large deflection, shape memory alloy (SMA) based actuators are uniquely suitable for this system. In this paper, we discuss the design and development of a reconfigurable parabolic antenna structure. The reflector skin of the antenna is vacuum formed using a metalized polycarbonate shell. Two different strategies are chosen for the antenna actuation. Initially, an SMA wire based offset network is formed on the back side of the reflector. A computational model is developed using equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion (ECTE) for the SMA wire. Subsequently, the interaction between the antenna and SMA wire is modeled as a constrained recovery system, using a 1D modified Brinson model. Joule effect based SMA phase transformation is considered for the relationship between input voltage and temperature at the SMA wire. The antenna is modeled using ABAQUS based finite element methodology. The deflection found through the computational model is compared with that measured in experiment. Subsequently, a point-wise actuation system is developed for higher deflection. For power-minimization, an auto-locking device is developed. The performance of the new configuration is compared with the offset-network configuration. It is envisaged that the study will provide a comprehensive procedure for the design of intelligent flexible structures especially suitable for space applications. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","active shape control; reconfigurable space antenna; SMA actuator; smart antenna system","ABAQUS; Actuators; Antenna reflectors; Computation theory; Computational methods; Design; Finite element method; Flexible structures; Locks (fasteners); Metal implants; Reflection; Shape memory effect; Space applications; Thermal expansion; Wire; Active shape control; Design and Development; Finite element methodology; Network configuration; Shape memory alloys(SMA); SMA actuators; Smart antenna systems; Space antenna; Parabolic antennas",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",09641726,,SMSTE,,"English","Smart Mater Struct",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028626555

The master wants to distribute these computations to untrusted workers who have volunteered or are incentivized to help with this task. However, the data must be kept private (in an information theoretic sense) and not revealed to the individual workers. The workers may be busy and will take a random time to finish the task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the aggregate delay experienced by the master. We focus on linear computations as an essential operation in many iterative algorithms. A known solution is to use a linear secret sharing scheme to divide the data into secret shares on which the workers can compute. We propose to use instead new secure codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the authors. We study the delay induced by Staircase codes which is always less than that of secret sharing. The reason is that secret sharing schemes need to wait for the responses of a fixed fraction of the workers, whereas Staircase codes offer more flexibility in this respect. For instance, for codes with rate R = 1/2 Staircase codes can lead to up to 40% reduction in delay compared to secret sharing. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Stairs; Confidential data; Iterative algorithm; Linear computations; Linear secret sharing schemes; Medical data; Secret sharing; Secret sharing schemes; Secure codes; Information theory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21578095,9781509040964,PISTF,,"English","IEEE Int Symp Inf Theor Proc",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034034104

As energy becomes a quite challenging issue in these networks, clustering protocols are employed to deal with this problem. One of the main research areas in cluster-based routing protocols is fair distribution and balancing the overall energy consumption in the WSN, by selecting the most suitable cluster heads (CHs). In order to reduce the energy consumption and enhancing the CHs selection process a new routing protocol based on fuzzy logic has been proposed. There exist several algorithms based of fuzzy logic to select the most proper CHs for the network. But these algorithms do not consider all the important parameters and information of the sensor nodes in order to guarantee the optimal selection of the CHs. In The proposed algorithm, a two-step fuzzy logic system is used to select the appropriate CHs. The selection of CHs is based on six descriptors; residual energy, density, distance to base station, vulnerability index, centrality and distance between CHs. The result of the simulation indicates that, the proposed algorithm performs better comparing with some other similar approaches in case of fair distribution and balancing of the overall energy consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cluster heads selection; Clustering protocols; Energy; Fuzzy logic; WSNs","Algorithms; Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Reconfigurable hardware; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Cluster head; Clustering protocol; Energy; Resource restrictions; Vulnerability index; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Fuzzy logic","Tamandani, Y.K.; Department of Computer Science, Aligarh Muslim UniversityIndia; email: Yahya.kord@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964008632

Firstly, the RFDMRP: River Formation Dynamics based Multi-hop Routing Protocol has been proposed. Later, this protocol is integrated with clustering and a new hybrid technique, named as hybrid clustering communication algorithm using RFDMRP (HCCRFD) is introduced. HCCRFD improves energy conservation by reducing overall packet transmission distance of intra and inter cluster communication, which results in increased network lifetime. Energy consumption of proposed algorithm has been analyzed mathematically. Also, the algorithms were simulated using MATLAB and outputs observed. The observed outputs were compared with existing protocols such as LEACH, DEEC, ERA, and ACH2 in three different scenarios namely homogenous, heterogeneous environment, and node density. The comparison reveals that the proposed algorithm perform better than the existing protocols with respect to energy conservation and network lifetime. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cluster; Data collection; Multi-hop routing; Network lifetime; River formation dynamics; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks","Data acquisition; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Data collection; Formation dynamics; Multi-hop routing; Network lifetime; Clustering algorithms","Guravaiah, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kguravaiah@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011568175

In WSNs, geographic adaptive fidelity (GAF) is one of the most energy efficient location based protocol which extends the network lifetime by identifying equivalence between sensors using geographic location information and then keeping unnecessary sensors in sleep state, while maintaining application fidelity. Still traditional GAF cannot reach to the optimum energy usage since it needs more hop count to transmit data packets to the base station called sink. As a result, it leads to higher energy usage and packet delay due to participation of more sensors. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based topology management protocol named FTGAF-HEX, which bases on GAF is proposed to achieve minimum packet delay with higher energy conservation. Furthermore, we propose to use a generalized version of GAF based on honeycomb virtual grid architecture called Hexagonal GAF (GAF-HEX) to replace the square grid with hexagonal one. Analysis and simulation results show significant improvement of the proposed work compared to traditional GAF in the aspect of various performance metrics i.e., total hop count, energy consumption and distance covered by the data packet before reaching the sink. As a result, compared to traditional GAF-HEX, it needs 37–44% less hop count and consumes 17–24% less energy to prolong the network lifetime. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Internet protocols; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Geographic adaptive fidelities; Geographic location; Geographic routing protocols; Location-based protocols; Performance metrics; Topology management; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Power management (telecommunication)","Soni, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology MesraIndia; email: vaibsoni@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",09467076,,,,"English","Microsyst Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010723247

Due to the wide variety of WSN applications, there is a need for protocol solutions optimized for specific application classes. JRAM is proposed for WSNs deployed for monitoring multiple events in the same geographic region which require prompt detection and response. In existing contention-based synchronous MAC protocols designed for this, a node gets only one chance to succeed in data transmission scheduling per cycle, and a sink can also only receive data packets from at most one node in a cycle. Therefore, end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD) and packet delivery ratio (PDR) of these protocols drastically degrade with the increase in event occurrence rate (EOR). In contrast, JRAM proposes a novel approach to provide {k (k >1) chances to a node to succeed in data transmission scheduling in a cycle, and also allows a sink to receive data packets from k nodes in the same cycle. This is done, in JRAM, by partitioning the network nodes into k disjoint sets and then using a novel cycle structure. We evaluate JRAM through extensive NS-2.35 simulations and compare its performance with existing pipelined data collection (PDC), adaptive data collection (ADC), and CROPMAC protocols, for different types of traffic loads and traffic patterns. Results suggest that in case of high EOR, JRAM outperforms PDC, ADC and CROPMAC both in terms of the E2ETD and the PDR. © 2014 IEEE.","Energy-efficiency; medium access control (MAC) protocols; routing protocols; transmission delay; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Access control; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Network routing; Oil well flooding; Routing protocols; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Data transmission scheduling; End-to-end transmission; Many-to-one communications; Medium access control protocols; Packet delivery ratio; Transmission delays; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wsn applications; Wireless sensor networks","Singh, R.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology GuwahatiIndia; email: s.ripudaman@iitg.ernet.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23274662,,,,"English","IEEE Internet Things J.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023196570

These restrictions make the sensor network prone to failures because most of the energy is spent on data transmission, sensing, and computing. Many applications such as habitat monitoring, military surveillance and forest fire detection expect the sensor nodes to last for a long time because they operate human unattended. Therefore, the major challenges in designing a wireless sensor network (WSN) are energy conservation, reducing data transmission delay and improving the network lifetime. In this context, data aggregation is an intelligent technique used in WSN, wherein the data from disparate sources are accumulated at intermediate nodes, thereby reducing the number of packets to be sent to the sink. Literature study shows that various routing algorithms are used to perform data aggregation based on the network topology. In order to provide an improved performance amongst the existing, a routing algorithm called cluster-chain mobile agent routing (CCMAR) is proposed in this work. It makes full use of the advantages of both low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (PEGASIS). CCMAR divides the WSN into a few clusters and runs in two phases.The proposed system is simulated and evaluated for the performance metrics such as energy consumption, transmission delay and network lifetime.

In WSNs, energy management and network lifetime optimization are major issues in the designing of routing protocols. Clustering is an efficient data gathering technique that effectively reduces the energy consumption by organizing nodes into groups. However, in clustering protocols, cluster heads (CHs) bear additional load for coordinating various activities within the cluster. Improper selection of CHs causes increased energy consumption and also degrades the performance of WSN. Therefore, proper CH selection and their load balancing using efficient routing protocol is a critical aspect for the long run operation of WSN. Clustering a network with proper load balancing is an NP-hard problem. To solve such problems having vast search area, optimization algorithm is the preeminent possible solution. In this paper, differential evolution based clustering algorithm for WSNs named threshold-sensitive energy-efficient delay-aware routing protocol (TEDRP), is proposed to prolong network lifetime. Dual-hop communication between CHs and BS is utilized to achieve load balancing of distant CHs and energy minimization. The paper also considers stability-aware model of TEDRP named stable TEDRP (STEDRP) with an intend to extend the stability period of the network. In STEDRP, energy aware heuristics is applied for CH selection in order to improve the stability period. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocols significantly outperform existing protocols in terms of energy consumption, system lifetime and stability period. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Boolean DE; DE; Network lifetime; Stability period; WSN","Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet protocols; Network routing; Optimization; Power management; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Boolean DE; Clustering protocol; Differential Evolution; Distributed nodes; Energy minimization; Network lifetime; Optimization algorithms; Stable clustering; Power management (telecommunication)","Mittal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh UniversityIndia; email: mittal.nitin84@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010735716

Information gathering is a typical but an important operation in many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It is necessary to operate the sensor network for longer period of time in an energy efficient manner for gathering information. One of the popular WSN protocol, named low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and its variants, aim to prolong the network lifetime using energy efficient clustering approach. These protocols increase the network lifetime at the expense of reduced stability period (the time span before the first node dies). The reduction in stability period is because of the high energy variance of nodes. Stability period is an essential aspect to preserve coverage properties of the network. Higher is the stability period, more reliable is the network. Higher energy variance of nodes leads to load unbalancing among nodes and therefore lowers the stability period. Hence, it is perpetually attractive to design clustering algorithms that provides higher stability, lower energy variance and are energy efficient. In this paper to overcome the shortcomings of existing clustering protocols, a protocol named stable energy efficient clustering protocol is proposed. It balances the load among nodes using energy-aware heuristics and hence ensures higher stability period. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms LEACH and its variants in terms of energy variance and stability period. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; DRESEP; Network lifetime; Residual energy; SEECP; WSNs","Clustering algorithms; Leaching; Low power electronics; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; DRESEP; Network lifetime; Residual energy; SEECP; WSNs; Energy efficiency","Mittal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh UniversityIndia; email: mittal.nitin84@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961588974

This paper proposes an energy efficient approach for a cluster based wireless sensor network architecture by employing the game theory and ant colony optimization technique. Initially, the proposed work forms various clusters within the network and thereafter, the coalitions are formed using the proposed algorithm based on the game theory. The proposed algorithm considers the extent of spatially correlated sensed data that are generated by neighbouring nodes in order to form a coalition within a cluster. The proposed coalition scheme reduces the number of transmissions across the network. It is compared with the competing clustering protocols. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves the increased network lifetime under the specified quality of service specification (QSS). The results of the proposed work are compared with that obtained through the existing low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and the deterministic stable election protocols (D-SEP). The overall improvement gain achieved by the proposed work is 31% and 10% at specified QSS, when compared with the LEACH and the D-SEP protocols respectively.

At the same time, trust management system should not be power killing, complex in terms of computation and processing capability. To convey a noticeable framework, we propose Collaborative Trust based Secure Routing protocol (CTSR) for observing direct and indirect trust values. Here we utilize two-way acknowledgement-based trust framework (2-ACKT) which requires lesser memory resources and minimizes the communication overhead. Our simulation setup for Mobile Adhoc Networks with 2-ACKT framework calculates trust value with both direct and indirect observations based on Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of uncertain reasoning approach respectively. Since the inception of DST for indirect observation in wireless networks trust values are effectively derived with data packets and control packets. The capability of DST to solve the problems with different reliability has flaws in certain areas where the nodes were subjected to disclose critical information like residual energy level and available bandwidth. And also common results derived from DST may lead to uncertain decisions.

To address this challenge, we leverage the intrinsic resilience of application domains such as multimedia, recognition, mining, search, and analytics where acceptable outputs are produced despite occasional approximate computations. We propose stochastic checkers (checkers designed using stochastic logic) as a new approach to performing error checking in an approximate manner at greatly reduced overheads. Stochastic checkers are inherently inaccurate and require long latencies for computation. To limit the loss in error coverage, as well as false positives (correct outputs flagged as erroneous), caused due to the approximate nature of stochastic checkers, we propose input permuted partial replicas of stochastic logic, which improves their accuracy with minimal increase in overheads. To address the challenge of long error detection latency, we propose progressive checking policies that provide an early decision based on a prefix of the checker's output bitstream. This technique is further enhanced by employing progressively accurate binary-to-stochastic converters. Across a suite of error-resilient applications, we observe that stochastic checkers lead to greatly reduced overheads (29.5% area and 21.5% power, on average) compared with traditional fault tolerance techniques while maintaining high coverage and very low false positives. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Approximate error detection; fault detection; low power; permuted partial replicas; progressive checking; stochastic computing (SC)","CMOS integrated circuits; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cost reduction; Error detection; Errors; Fault tolerance; Approximate computation; Critical challenges; Deeply scaled CMOS; Error detection latency; Error-resilient; Fault tolerance techniques; Reliable systems; Stochastic logic; Stochastic systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10638210,,IEVSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Very Large Scale Integr VLSI Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017092172

Increasing the number of VMs placed by a CSP not only increases the power consumption but also decreases the profit margin of the CSP. In this paper, we propose a technique called maximum VM placement with minimum power consumption (MVMP) to maximize the profit earned by a CSP. The proposed technique attempts to maximize the revenue and minimize the power budget. It is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem, and is solved using simulated annealing (SA) technique. To reach a sub-optimal solution more randomness is applied to SA. Our MVMP algorithm is compared to five state of the art algorithms in the realm of strategic VM placement, namely Marotta and Avallone (MA) approach, Hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), Modified Best-Fit decreasing (MBFD), First-Fit decreasing (FFD) and Random deployment. We observe that MVMP performs better than Marotta and Avallone (MA) approach, HGA, MBFD, FFD and Random placement in terms of number of servers used, energy consumption, profit and execution time. Scalability of MVMP is verified using two different scenarios: (i) fixed number of VMs and, (ii) fixed number of servers.

A collection of all such social interactions among a group of individuals (or agents) observed over an interval of time is referred to as a temporally-detailed (TD) social network. A TD social network opens up the opportunity to explore TD questions on the underlying social system, e.g., “How is the betweenness centrality of an individual changing with time?” To this end, related work has proposed temporal extensions of centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness and closeness). However, scalable computation of these metrics for long time-intervals is challenging. This is due to the non-stationary ranking of shortest paths (the underlying structure of betweenness and closeness) between a pair of nodes which violates the assumptions of classical dynamic programming based techniques. To this end, we propose a novel computational paradigm called epoch-point based techniques for addressing the non-stationarity challenge of TD social networks. Using the concept of epoch-points, we develop a novel algorithm for computing shortest path based centrality metric such as betweenness on a TD social network. We prove the correctness and completeness of our algorithm.

Following this development, the multi-server authentication (MSA), lets subscribers the provision of services from various service providers out of a single registration performed initially. The user seeks to register from registration centre first, and could avail a range of services onwards. The research efforts on MSA based framework, for making it lightweight and security resilient, has been going on a reasonable pace. However, yet we have not come up with a framework that can be relied upon for deployment in an access network bearing nodes that demand low computational cost. Recently, in this regard, Tsai and Lo presented a chaotic map-based multi-server authentication protocol. However, the Tsai and Lo scheme is found vulnerable to key-compromise impersonation attack, Bergamo et al. and password guessing attack by Lu et al. In return, Lu et al. presented a model countering the flaws of Tsai and Lo scheme. We review both schemes and found that Tsai et al. is still vulnerable to more threats, and at the same time, we demonstrate that Lu et al. is also vulnerable to RC-spoofing attack, replay attack, anonymity failure and bears some technical flaws. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient scheme improved upon Tsai et al. protocol.

We suggested a new method related to co-ordinator head (CNH) selection by using a mixed hierarchical cluster based algorithm that includes selecting the CNH happens to be the greatest value of the co-ordinator node (CN) and fitness value. This analysis put forward two different algorithms; mixed hierarchical cluster oriented routing program and hybrid hierarchical secure algorithm. A mixed hierarchal cluster based algorithm has been suggested for generating CNH and CN, for identifying the harmful node and packet is securely delivered. The source node transmits details about packet to the CN and then it chooses the pathway which is the shortest, depending upon the trust value among intermediate node and sensor node. The behavior activities of all the nodes are analyzed by the CNH, if anyone of the node’s behavior found to be incorrect, the organizer who finds the harmful node and CNH will drop those particular node behaviors. The CNH then changes to other path way immediately and transmits the delivery packet securely to the target destination under short time. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Co-ordinator node; Energy-efficient routing; HHSRP; Hybrid hierarical routing; Normalized routing load","Energy efficiency; Hierarchical systems; Network security; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient routing; Fitness values; HHSRP; Hierarchical clusters; Hybrid hierarical routing; Intermediate node; Normalized routing loads; Secure routing protocols; Clustering algorithms","Deepa, C.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Faculty of Computing, Sathyabama UniversityIndia; email: depmca@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026439694

In this context, speaker recognition techniques are of paramount importance due to their high user acceptance and low required cooperation. Typical applications of biometric recognition in AmI environments are identification techniques designed to recognize individuals in small datasets. Biometric recognition methods are frequently deployed on embedded hardware and therefore need to be optimized in terms of computational time as well as used memory. This paper presents a text-independent speaker recognition method particularly suitable for identification in AmI environments. The proposed method first computes the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and then creates Information Set Features (ISF) by applying a fuzzy logic approach. Finally, it estimates the user's identity by using a hierarchical classification technique based on computational intelligence.

However, from today's perspective his model has several severe shortcomings that limit the applicability to real-world networks. In order to give a more convincing explanation of the algorithmic small-world phenomenon, we study decentralized greedy routing in a more flexible random graph model (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs) which overcomes all previous shortcomings. Apart from exhibiting good properties in theory, it has also been extensively experimentally validated that this model reasonably captures real-world networks. In this model, the greedy routing protocol is purely distributed as each vertex only needs to know information about its direct neighbors. We prove that it succeeds with constant probability, and in case of success almost surely finds an almost shortest path of length Θ(log log n), where our bound is tight including the leading constant. Moreover, we study natural local patching methods which augment greedy routing by backtracking and which do not require any global knowledge. We show that such methods can ensure success probability 1 in an asymptotically tight number of steps. These results also address the question of Krioukov et al. [52] whether there are efficient local routing protocols for the internet graph. There were promising experimental studies, but the question remained unsolved theoretically.

The advancement in VLSI technology have made chip testing more complicated which has lead to the popularity of Logic Built In Self Test(LBIST) compared to Automatic Test Equipment(ATE). Logic BIST allows in-built chip testing with the help of an additional hardware structure inside the circuit. The test patterns are not applied by ATE but are generated by inbuilt testing circuits. MISR is commonly used as an output response analyzer since it is alternative to n-parallel LFSRs. MISRs accelerates the testing methodology by compacting multi-bit streams into single signature. A Reconfigurable LFSR can be used as the test pattern generator as well as a response compactor inside Logic BIST to improve the fault coverage of IC testing. The proposed MISR architecture is simulated in Modelsim RTL simulator. The different sized (16, 32, 64) programmable MISR structures is synthesized in Xilinx Spartan 6 for implementing MISR on FPGA. Four structural representations such as Modular, Standard, Hybrid and Complete MISR are implemented.

The CoMP technique enables to share the channel superiority measurements and schedules the transmissions, allowing for more efficient radio resource utilization. Though CoMP technique achieves efficient resource allocation it is also required to minimize the power consumption of the MIMO-OFDM network. Thus the optimization issue is framed as a reduction of total transmit power subjected to individual user rate targets and every antenna's power constraints across multiple cooperating base stations. But these optimization parameters are coupled with non-linear terms and they turn out to be highly non-convex. To solve the non-convex issue Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) technique is adopted. In this paper the proposed technique involves the Energy Harvesting relay node being adopted through SCA technique which is named as EH-SCA (Energy Harvesting-Successive Convex Approximation) in the MIMO-OFDM network by which transmit power is tremendously reduced and high user rate targets are achieved than that of existing work. Hence the EH-SCA technique converges to evaluates the performance metrics of MIMO-OFDM network efficiently. © 2016 IEEE.","Power minimization; Successive Convex Approximation(SCA) energy harvesting relay node","Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Equipment testing; Gain control; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio transmission; Relay control systems; Coordinated multi point (CoMP); Efficient resource allocation; Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing; Optimization parameter; Power minimization; Relay node; Successive convex approximations; Total transmit power; MIMO systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

National Mission on Energy Efficiency (NMEE) has been instrumental in managing the Energy related efforts towards sustainability. Perform, Achieve and Trade(PAT) is the flagship scheme of NMEE where improvements in Specific Energy Consumption of identified Designated Consumers is contributing to reduction in the Energy in the demand side. Indian Railways is also one of the sectors identified to participate in PAT Scheme. Indian Railways consumed over 17.5 billion kWhr which accounts to 1.8% of total Indian Electricity consumption. Indian Railways paid about Rs 10,000 crore towards electricity charges. Traction constitutes 85% and non-traction constitutes 15% of the energy consumption. In 2014-15, Railways consumed about 2.5 billion units for non-traction electric power with average cost of power of about Rs 6.50 per unit. The initial assessments have brought out that on non-traction side lighting consumes about 25-40%, water pumping 30-35%, fans about 15% and air-conditioning about 10-15% energy.

Since RF exists at the highest level in cache hierarchy, designing it with memories with high write latency/energy (e.g., spin transfer torque RAM) can lead to large energy loss. In this paper, we present an spin orbit torque RAM (SOT-RAM) based RF design which provides higher energy efficiency than SRAM and STT-RAM RFs while maintaining performance same as that of SRAM RF. To further improve energy efficiency of SOT-RAM based RF, we propose avoiding redundant bit-writes to RF.

The main challenge of WSN is the distance, energy and time delay. The power resource of the sensor node is a non-rechargeable battery. Here the greater the distance between the nodes, higher the energy consumption. For having the effective transmission of data with less energy, the cluster-head approach is used. It is well known that the time delay is directly proportional to the distance between the nodes and the base station. The cluster head is selected in such a way that it is spatially closer enough to the base station as well as the sensor nodes. So, the time delay can be substantially reduced. This, in turn, the transmission speed of the data packets can be increased. Firefly algorithm is developed for maximizing the energy efficiency of network and lifetime of nodes by selecting the cluster head optimally. In this paper firefly with cyclic randomization is proposed for selecting the best cluster head. The network performance is increased in this method when compared to the other conventional algorithms. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cluster head; Firefly with cyclic randomization (FCR); Wireless sensor network","Base stations; Bioluminescence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimization; Random processes; Sensor nodes; Time delay; Cluster head; Cluster-head selections; Conventional algorithms; Effective transmission; Energy efficient; Firefly algorithms; Firefly with cyclic randomization (FCR); Transmission speed; Wireless sensor networks","Sarkar, A.; Vel Tech Dr RR & Dr SR Technical UniversityIndia; email: sarkar.amit2k@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023781814

It can be seen in the literature that considerably less attention has been given to provide security in SDN-enabled smart grid networks. Most of the efforts focus on protecting smart grid networks against various forms of outsider attacks only by providing consistent access control, applying efficient and effective security policies, and managing and controlling the network through the use of a centralized SDN controller. Furthermore, centralized SDN controllers are plagued by reliability and security issues. This paper presents a framework with multiple SDN controllers and security controllers that provides a secure and robust smart grid architecture. The proposed framework deploys a local IDS in a substation to collect the measurement data periodically and to monitor the control-commands that are executed on SCADA slaves. A global IDS in control center collects the measurement data from the substations and estimates the state of the smart grid system by utilizing the theory of differential evolution. The global IDS further verifies the consequences of control-commands issued by SDN controller and SCADA master. An alarm is generated upon detection of an attacker or unsteady state of the smart grid system. The framework also deploys light-weight identity based cryptography to protect the smart grid network from outside attacks. Performance comparison and initial simulation result have been presented to show that the proposed framework is effective as compared to existing security frameworks for SDN-enabled smart grids. © 2017 IEEE.","Attacks; IDS; SDN; Security; Smart Grids","Access control; Computation theory; Computer networks; Controllers; Distributed computer systems; Electric power transmission networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Network function virtualization; Optimization; Smart power grids; Attacks; Differential Evolution; Identity based cryptography; Performance comparison; Security; Smart grid; Smart grid architectures; Software defined networking (SDN); Network security",,"Ferreira J.E.Higashino T.Musaev A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538632925,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In many cases it seems that the product hardly attains its principal objectives due to improper prioritization. Increased emphasis on requirement prioritization and highly dynamic requirements makes management of composite services time consuming and difficult task. When software project has rigid timelines, limited resources, but high client expectations, an instantaneous deployment of most vital and critical features becomes mandatory. The problem can be solved by prioritizing the requirements. Over the past years, various techniques for requirement prioritization are presented by a variety of researchers in software engineering domain.

The adaptive mechanism includes Addition of new requirement set, Analysis and Reallocation of requirements, Assignment and Alteration of priorities and Re-prioritization.

Mobile ad-hoc network is an ensemble of mobile nodes which is gently connected without any centralized base station of network. For transmitting data from one node to another node routing protocols are used. This paper focus on AODV routing protocol that is one of extensively used routing protocol in MANET. Energy consumption is a main issue in Ad hoc network which speciously builds attention today. AODV routing protocol is not consider energy of nodes in route discovery phase. If less energy of node occurs in between the path, it causes packet dropping. It leads to link-failure problem. After that system reinitiate RREQ message from source node again. Therefore, it causes more energy consumption. To overcome this issue, we proposed a new technique based on existing AODV routing protocol without disconnection of route after link failure problem. This scheme does not cause link failure problem and avoid rebroadcast message again from source node. This gives a significant improvement in node energy. The simulation result shows that proposed technique will enhance the energy of network. The comparison results between proposed AODV and existing AODV routing protocols are shown in terms of various QoS parameters such as throughput, energy spent, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio.

Routing protocols plays an important role to improve the overall performance of network in terms of delay, throughput, network lifetime etc. and to improve the quality of services (QoS) in WBAN. Network lifetime and successfully transmission of data to the sink node are two main factors to design a routing protocol. Routing in WBAN is classified as QoS based, temperature aware, clusters based routing, postural based, cross layer network based routing etc. These categories are further divided into various protocols. This paper provides a review of some of the existing routing protocols of WBAN by describing their techniques, advantages and disadvantages.

Many innovations are discovered in the field of OCR, but still many challengers are waiting for the solutions such as the recognition of document-backside-layered characters along with front side layer characters. The recognition of paper-backside-layered handwritten cum printed text is very difficult than the recognition of paper-frontside-layered characters. The fuzzy logic system process the data with help of bunch set of primary-based knowledge and delivers it into high successive recognition rate by using fuzzy classification functions, inference rules with decision-making procedures. Neural networks are compatible and best area to solve the pattern cum text recognition tasks, the learning based process start to implement from the basic imprecise data and algorithmic steps are formed with help of neuron-based learning process cum observations, but it is not effective to accomplish the user expected requirements for making the decisions.

Here the front sub layer text is completely bypassed with backside layer. The document-backside-layer input characters converted into neural-inputs, transformed it into fuzzy-sets, then fuzzy-rules applied based on the knowledge in fuzzification, related output responses are generated and the pre-cum-post-processing technique has applied to backside layer characters.

Enormous storage of data and high-speed computing to customers over the internet can be accomplished using cloud. Security of data in cloud is one of the chief concerns which acts as an obstacle in the realization of cloud computing. Along with quick expansion and application of cloud computing, users concern more and more regarding security and privacy issues involved in these techniques. An efficient method to perform privacy preserving image filtering operations in encrypted domain over cloud is proposed in this paper. The proposed method provides facility for distributed secure processing and storage of the secret image using Shamir's secret sharing method and Chinese remainder theorem. The plain secret image is divided into number of shares in a manner that each share by itself does not reveal any meaningful information about the original image, while collectively, they retain all the information. Two secret keys are used to avail security of image shares and without knowledge of such keys, one cannot restore the secret image back. Hence, the proposed scheme is highly secured and the image can be processed without revealing any information at the cloud data center.

In a liberalized electricity market, transmission lines are normally operated near its rated capacity and sometimes, this may cause congestion in the lines. This is because every market participants have the intention to maximize their profits. Failure of managing congestion properly may ultimately lead to the system collapse. Several methods including both classical and modern heuristic techniques have been used to address the problems of congestion management with different level of success. A novel hybrid algorithm based on differential evolution and chaos theory is presented in the present paper to alleviate congestion in power systems by rescheduling of participating generators. The algorithm tested on a standard system to demonstrate its capability in alleviating congestion of power systems. A comparative result is also presented in the present work.

Our design of proposed model for the addition of many integer pairs using parallel Cellular Automata Machines (CAMs) can perform the addition in a much better way with setting a preprocessing testing logic in it. CVT and XOR operations together can do the efficient addition of two non-negative integers for any bulk inputs using CAM. Multiplication is the repetitive addition process, which could be designed using recursive use of CAM.

Virtualization is the basic technique of creating various resources from the available physical infrastructure. It is the backbone of cloud computing technology. This paper try to deal with studying various techniques, models, algorithms, for efficient green cloud computing by using virtualization techniques. It mainly involves virtual machines(VMs) consolidation. Power utilization can be reduced by simply deactivating and reactivating physical machines to meet the current workload. Power awareness in distributed system can be defined as identifying the parameters which minimize the energy consumption along with better QOS, SLA. The various strategies discussed here are mainly focusing on saving power and making data centers more efficient by considering server and network as its scope, however in future due to requirement of high bandwidth and network connectivity of data centers, power requirement of data center will go beyond our imagination. To handle the above mentioned concern require actual study of how power consumption happens in data centers, most of the part of power are consumed by servers, CPU and switches i.e. network devices. There still lots of research need to be done to design such modern algorithm and techniques which achieve better energy efficiency along with consideration of QOS, SLA, and VM consolidation by defining VM topologies which are fault tolerant and also helps nature, mankind by minimizing Co2 emission. © 2017 IEEE.","datacenters; energy efficient cloud; green computing; virtualization; vm","Cloud computing; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fault tolerant computer systems; Network security; Power management; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Cloud computing technologies; Data centers; Distributed systems; Energy efficient; Energy-saving techniques; Network connectivity; Power requirement; Virtualization Techniques; Green computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034048,,,"English","Int.

They comprise only mobile nodes that use wireless transmission and can be set anywhere and anytime because they eliminate complexity of infrastructure and central admission. The Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are extensively used in different fields such as emergency situations, military applications and mobile communications. The routing is the major issue in the field of MANET due to the mobility nature and lack of infrastructure of the network. The different routing protocols have been proposed to address the routing issue. The development of multipath routing for mobile ad hoc network by considering the performance metrics with standard simulator is an important research area.

The main objective of the PNDMSR is selecting energy aware node-disjoint multipath from source to destination by optimizing the overhead using node's cost and it increases the network of lifetime. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy; MANET; MDSR; Overhead; PNDMSR; Routing","Ad hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Military applications; Military communications; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Packet networks; Power management; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Energy; MANET; MDSR; Overhead; PNDMSR; Routing; Power management (telecommunication)",,"PadmaSai Y.Garg D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015603,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The main objective of cognitive radios is to sense the surrounding and use primary user's vacant spaces and allot them to the secondary users without interference each other. This paper presents the optimal solution and optimizes the Quality of services (QoS) parameters to minimum i.e. smaller as compare other solutions which are induced by different optimization techniques Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed algorithm called spider monkey optimization algorithm (SMO). SMO is a swarm intelligence technique which works on foraging behaviour of spider monkeys. SMO is tentative and lapse based synergetic iterative process. Spider monkeys have been categorized as fusion-fission social structure (FHSS) based animals and they divides into smaller subgroups and search food. The proposed algorithm has been used to optimize the performance of QoS parameters in terms of minimum power consumption, minimum bit error rate (BER), maximum throughput, minimum interference and maximum spectral efficiency. The simulation results shows that the fitness scores obtained by the proposed algorithm i.e. SMO are better (smaller) than SA and GA algorithm in the optimization of QoS parameters of cognitive radio system.

These nodes are intelligent of sensing and monitoring the environmental or physical condition like temperature, sound, pressure, motion, etc. and communicating with other nodes. Sensor nodes in WSN have limited power and energy constraint hence it becomes necessary to efficiently use these resources. Energy consumption is the major problem of WSN to overcome this problem there are many solutions introduced, it consists flat, hierarchical and location based routing. The basic hierarchical routing protocol for WSN is Low Energy Adaptive clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). LEACH works in two different phases viz. set-up and steady-state phase. LEACH periodically do the rotations among cluster-head nodes in such a way that every node gets a chance to become cluster head and distributes energy consumption between the nodes in the network which reduces the power utilization, increasing the lifetime of the network. In this paper detail working of LEACH is discussed using Omnet++ simulator. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy consumption; LEACH; Wireless sensor network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Leaching; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head nodes; Energy constraint; Energy efficient routing protocol; Hierarchical routing protocol; Location based routing; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Physical conditions; Steady state; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052974,,,"English","Proc.

Time delay systems exist in several real world applications, and the delay is generally caused by the time taken by the sensor to sense the parameter, communication delay etc. Hence such characteristics lead to instabilities and make it difficult to control the system. Classical control theory methods fail for designing stable controller time delay systems. So, in order to address this problem, in this paper, the design of PID controller has been posed as an optimization problem and solved using genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

But due to the presence of categorical data values, these algorithms face a challenge in their implementation. Also some algorithms which are able to take care of categorical data are not able to process uncertainty in the values and so have stability issues. Thus handling categorical data along with uncertainty has been made necessary owing to such difficulties. So, in 2007 MMR [1] algorithm was developed which was based on basic rough set theory. MMeR [2] was proposed in 2009 which surpassed the results of MMR in taking care of categorical data. It has the capability of handling heterogeneous data but only to a limited extent because it is based on classical rough set model. In this paper, we generalize the MMeR algorithm with neighbourhood relations and make it a neighbourhood rough set model which we call MMeNR (Min Mean Neighborhood Roughness). It takes care of the heterogeneous data and also the uncertainty associated with it. Standard data sets have been used to gauge its effectiveness over the other methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Clustering; MMeNR; MMeR; MMR; Neighborhood; Uncertainty","Computation theory; Data handling; Rough set theory; Set theory; Clustering; MMeNR; MMeR; Neighborhood; Uncertainty; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052974,,,"English","Proc.

The principle objective of the artificial voice synthesizer is to make dumb people to communicate easily with other people even who cannot understand the sign language. Communication can be made easier by giving artificial voice to the dumb people so that they do not face any kind of difficulty in communicating with the world. This device makes use of neural sensors which is fixed over the head and behind the user's ear lobe. The users can make their usual signs for conveying their ideas. The sensors senses the brain impulses as each hand movement have a specific set of brain impulses and then some specific calculations are made using Discrete Fourier Transform. The fuzzy logics in Artificial intelligence is used to match the obtained solutions of the converted signals with the stored solutions so that it converts the impulses into voice and gives that voice(the translated, artificially synthesized voice of the dumb people) as output which makes others to understand their comments easily. Thus the 'Artificial voice synthesizer' comfort the dumb person in overcoming their disability by communicating like a normal person. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Conversion of signals into voice messages; Fuzzy logics; Neural impulses; Processing of signals","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Discrete Fourier transforms; Speech communication; Artificial voice; Hand movement; Neural impulses; Neural sensors; Sign language; Voice messages; Fuzzy logic",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062201,,,"English","Proc.

For load balancing and efficient data collection in the network, clustering is used. Sensors in each cluster send the data to their corresponding cluster heads. The cluster head performs data aggregation and transmission of the aggregated data to the base station. Farther sensor nodes data are aggregated by cluster heads and send to the base station. This leads to a heavy traffic and faster depletion of energy to the nodes that are nearer to the sink. To enhance the energy conservation, for suppressing hot spot problem and for load balance achievement, we propose an algorithm namely as ECUCF (Energy Conserved Unequal Clusters with Fuzzy logic). Based on the distances of the nodes from the base station, the network is divided into three different sectors. For designing unequal clusters in each sector, a fuzzy logic approach is followed. The cluster heads that are nearer to the base station are designed to be of smaller sizes whereas the cluster heads that are situated farther away from the sink to have higher cluster sizes. The proposed algorithm ECUCF is simulated using MATLAB environment. The performances obtained are compared with the performances of other clustering schemes like LEACH (equal clustering algorithm) and FBUC (unequal clustering algorithm). From the simulated results, it is found that the performances of ECUCF are much improved as compared to LEACH and FBUC in maximizing the number of clusters, increasing the number of live nodes in the network and extending the lifetime of nodes on each round of operation. © 2017 IEEE.","Cluster; Competition radius; Fuzzy logic; Prime-CH; Residual energy; Unequal clustering","Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Leaching; MATLAB; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Fuzzy logic approach; MATLAB environment; Number of clusters; Prime-CH; Research challenges; Residual energy; Unequal clustering; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062201,,,"English","Proc.

The scope of this paper is limited to interior lighting installations like commercial buildings and industrial buildings. The methodology described in this paper helps to understand energy efficiency as referred to light sources, interior lighting design and performance assessment indicators. Luminous efficacy indicates energy efficiency of light sources, but it is not the parameter based on which quality of a lighting application is decided, for deciding quality, color rendering capability of a light source important and can be determined from its spectral properties. Hence its important to understand to assess a light source for its quality implications; this paper helps the user to do quality assessment of light sources. Lighting on the work plane in an interior depends on optical efficiency of luminaires, room dimensions and their surface reflectance. The idea of energy efficient lighting design is to provide highest luminous efficacy on the work plane by making use of efficient luminaire, room reflectance, mounting height and least lighting power consumption. Illuminating non-task areas is as critical as task areas so that there is enough luminance distribution in the background to aid in eye adaptation, safety and circulation.

UWSNs need energy efficient designing approach, because underwater sensor nodes are battery driven. Also the deployed batteries cannot be easily recharged by non-conventional energy resources, like solar energies. Clustering is an effective technique to design an energy efficient UWSNs. Due to the sparse deployment of nodes and dynamic nature of the channel, the clustering characteristics of UWSNs are different from those of terrestrial wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we focused on optimal clustering for UWSNs which are compliant with any one of the acoustic, free space optical (FSO) and electromagnetic (EM) wave-based communication techniques. Besides, we proposed an energy dissipation model of sensor node for FSO and EM wave-based communication and compared with the contemporary energy dissipation model for acoustic-based communication.

Here, we examine at the global interaction of cells in a computational model of planarian regeneration. A key feature of our model is the integration of multiple organizational levels of an organism–from cells, to network, to global shape. The computational model is able to replicate most of the experimental observations thereby facilitating study of the putative mechanisms. We observe that a hierarchical interplay between local and long range signaling acts as a positional map that guides the cellular fate at any position.

Being complex in nature, traditional security countermeasures cannot be applied directly to IoT networks. Addressing this problem, this paper aims to combine the capabilities of 2 traditional methods namely, game theory (GT) and stochastic Petri nets (SPN), such that the resultant model is compatible for complex IoT networks. Game theory does not have enough modeling capability to cope up with complexity of IoT networks. However, it has an advantage of providing a priori idea of attacker's actions and strategies with the help of Nash equilibrium. This information is used by administrators to devise appropriate action plan to detect and prevent attacks on network. On the other hand, SPN is a dynamic, scalable and probabilistic model, which overcomes the limitations of GT. Nevertheless, it is not able to compute best strategies (Nash equilibrium) of attacker. Therefore, this paper proposes stochastic game net (SGN)–based model for security in IoT, which combines the advantages of SPN and GT. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that this is the first attempt to define SGN for handling security issues in IoT. Simulations performed using OPNET tool show that SGN shows 5.94% and 5.91% improvement in terms of confidentiality, 6.4% and 8% improvement in terms of integrity, and 6.7% and 8.9% improvement in terms of availability over SPN and GT, respectively.

The cluster based routing in WSNs is a prominent approach for energy conservation of the network which provides a hierarchical data collection mechanism. In order to maximize the energy conservation of sensor nodes, this paper proposes an Energy-efficient Layered Clustering Algorithm (ELCA) for routing in wireless sensor networks. ELCA constructs two layers of clusters to reduce the transmission rate and to balance the energy consumption of sensors. As early energy depletion of clusterheads (CHs) is a major limitation in clustering, this algorithm provides local remedy for energy suffering CHs through efficient CH substitution scheme. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analysed through extensive simulation experiments and verified by compared results with existing clustering algorithms.","Distributed Clustering; Energy Dissemination; Energy-Efficient Routing; K-means Clustering; Layered Clusters; Local Remedy; Multi-Level Clustering; Wireless Sensor Networks","Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Distributed clustering; Energy Dissemination; Energy efficient routing; K-means clustering; Layered Clusters; Local Remedy; Multilevels; Clustering algorithms",,,"IGI Global",19473532,,,,"English","Int.

People uses wireless technology along with sensor for monitoring home held devices, security alerts, natural disasters alert, building supervision, industrial quality management, etc. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of thousands of economical and feasible disposable sensors, deployed in the environment to sense parameters related to the surroundings such as temperature, moisture level, pressure etc., Number of sensor nodes are connected in these networks for communication. Each nodes are self-organized, having the capacity of sense, process, and aggregate data. Energy utilization in WSN is major issue in networks for improving network lifetime. Conventional clustering schemes are created with static cluster heads that die past than the normal nodes that degrade the network performance in routing. It is very vital area to develop an energy aware clustering protocol in WSN to reduce energy consumption for increasing network life time. In this paper, a Energy Aware Clustering using Neuro-fuzzy approach (EACNF) is proposed to form finest and energy aware clusters. The proposed scheme consists of fuzzy subsystem and neural network system that achieved energy efficiency in forming clusters and cluster heads in WSN. EACNF used neural network that provide effective training set related to energy and density of all nodes to estimate the expected energy for Uncertain cluster heads. Sensor nodes with higher energy are trained with various location of base station to select energy aware cluster heads. Fuzzy if–then mapping rule is used in fuzzy logic part that inputs to form clusters and cluster heads. EACNF is designed for WSN that handling Trust factor for security to the network. EACNF used three metric such as transmission range, residual energy and Trust factor for improving network life time. The proposed scheme EACNF is compared with related clustering schemes namely Cluster-Head Election Mechanism using Fuzzy Logic and Energy-Aware Fuzzy Unequal Clustering. The experiment results show that EACNF performs better than the other related schemes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clustering; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Neural network; Wireless sensor network","Computer circuits; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Neural networks; Power management; Quality management; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster-head elections; Clustering; Conventional clustering; Industrial quality management; Neural network systems; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless technologies; Power management (telecommunication)","Golden Julie, E.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: goldenjuliephd@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994449416

However, in some occasions, a sensor node required to move in the sensor networks. The node has to change its own position with the requirement of applications. Considering this phenomena, in this paper, we propose to design an angular function and private key management system authenticated by group leader for the transmission of a node. In the proposed scheme, the group is divided into sectors. The motion of the node is related with the angles to the group leader, which is the basis of our proposal. The nodes movement and activity should be tracked. The proposed scheme attains high connectivity and security with the help of the directional transreceiver.

The ever increasing power dissipation is the major problem in CMOS circuits and systems. The reversible computing has potential to overcome this problem and reversible logic circuits serve as the backbone in quantum computing. The reversible computing also offers fault diagnostic features. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanotechnology owing to its unique features like very high operating frequency, extremely low power dissipation, and nanoscale feature size is emerging as a promising candidate to replace CMOS technology. This paper presents design and performance analysis of area efficient QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin universal reversible logic gates. The proposed designs of QCA reversible Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin reversible gates utilize 39.62, 21.05, and 24.74% less number of QCA cells as compared to previous best designs. The rectangular layout area of proposed QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin gates are 52, 28.10, and 40.23%, respectively less than previous best designs. The optimized designs are realized employing 5-input majority gates to make proposed designs more compact and area efficient. The major advantage is that the optimized layouts of reversible gates did not utilize any rotated, translated QCA cells, and offer single layer accessibility to their inputs and outputs. The proposed efficient layouts did not employ any coplanar or multi-layer wire crossovers. The energy dissipation results have been computed for proposed area efficient reversible gates and thermal layouts are generated using accurate QCAPro power estimator tool.

In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words.

A sensor is battery-operated, unattended low-cost device with limited computing, communication and storage capabilities. Thus the network lifetime has become the key characteristic for evaluating sensor networks in an application-specific way. There are certain approaches in literature which consider the lifetime maximization problem. However, they suffer from impulsive energy hole, coverage hole and communication hole. In this paper we propose a novel Energy Efficient Connected Coverage (EECC) scheduling to maximize the lifetime of the WSN. The EECC adheres to Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as remaining energy, coverage and connectivity. In EECC the sensor which doesn't contribute to coverage will act as a relay node to reduce the burden of the sensing node. The sensing node senses the target whereas the relaying node communicates the sensory information to the sink. The EECC forms non-disjoint cover sets using remaining energy, coverage and connectivity of every sensor. The proposed EECC outperforms similar scheduling algorithms found in the literature in an energy efficient way with the short execution time. Through simulations the constancy of EECC in extending the lifetime of WSN is confirmed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient connected coverage (EECC); Lifetime maximization; Remaining energy; Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)","Energy efficiency; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Lifetime maximization; Remaining energies; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Roselin, J.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Regional Office, Anna University Tirunelveli RegionIndia; email: roselin.js@auttvl.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019650892

Mobile devices are equipped with a processing element that is responsible for performing all the controlling and computational tasks. Most of the computational tasks inside the processing element are performed by ALU circuit. ALU is considered as the computational engine and responsible for high power consumption. Previously, microprocessors and microcontrollers were the choice of designers but nowadays the horizon has been shifted to FPGAs and SOCs as a processing element in mobile devices. Obviously, FPGAs have numerous advantages over processors and the growing need of applications compels the designers to use FPGAs for fast processing. Although FPGAs fulfils the requirement of designers but they suffer from the disadvantage of high power consumption due to their complex circuitry. The demand of high performance and low power devices creates a bottleneck in front of designers specifically for battery operated portable wireless devices. So, this paper presents some power minimization techniques that can be applied on communication centric designs targeted to FPGAs. There are different techniques given in the literature but most of them are applied at device level only. This paper gives an insight to minimize the power at architectural level of design hierarchy using XPower Analyzer as a CAD tool. The proposed techniques are applied on arithmetic and logical unit circuit for analysis purpose, as ALU is the heart of processing elements used in portable wireless devices.

The five Kriging model variants studied here are: Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging based on pseudo-likelihood estimator, Blind Kriging, Co-Kriging and Universal Kriging based on marginal likelihood estimator. First three stochastic natural frequencies of the composite shell are analysed by using a finite element model that includes the effects of transverse shear deformation based on Mindlin’s theory in conjunction with a layer-wise random variable approach. The comparative assessment is carried out to address the accuracy and computational efficiency of five Kriging model variants. Comparative performance of different covariance functions is also studied. Subsequently the effect of noise in uncertainty propagation is addressed by using the Stochastic Kriging. Representative results are presented for both individual and combined stochasticity in layer-wise input parameters to address performance of various Kriging variants for low dimensional and relatively higher dimensional input parameter spaces. The error estimation and convergence studies are conducted with respect to original Monte Carlo Simulation to justify merit of the present investigation. The study reveals that Universal Kriging coupled with marginal likelihood estimate yields the most accurate results, followed by Co-Kriging and Blind Kriging. As far as computational efficiency of the Kriging models is concerned, it is observed that for high-dimensional problems, CPU time required for building the Co-Kriging model is significantly less as compared to other Kriging variants. © 2016, CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; Finite element method; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Natural frequencies; Shear flow; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Comparative assessment; Comparative performance; Covariance function; Critical assessment; Doubly curved shells; High-dimensional problems; Transverse shear deformation; Uncertainty propagation; Interpolation","Mukhopadhyay, T.; College of Engineering, Swansea UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: mukhopadhyay.mail@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",11343060,,,,"English","Arch.

Despite file distribution is responsible for a major portion of the current Internet traffic, little effort has been dedicated to address the issue of its energy efficiency so far. Most of the previous literature focuses on optimizing the download time of file distribution schemes (e.g. centralized server-based or distributed peer-to-peer solutions) while it is yet unclear how to optimize file distribution schemes from the point of view of energy consumed. In this paper, we present a general modelling framework to analyze the energy consumption of file distribution systems. First, we show that the general problem of minimizing energy consumption in file distribution is NP-hard. Then, for restricted versions of the problem, we establish theoretical bounds to minimal energy consumption. Furthermore, we define a set of optimal algorithms for a variety of system settings, which exploit the service capabilities of hosts in a P2P fashion. We show that our schemes are capable of reducing at least 50 % of the energy consumed by traditional (yet largely used) centralized distribution schemes even when considering effects such as network congestion and heterogeneous access speed across nodes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithms; Energy efficiency; File distribution; P2P; Performance","Algorithms; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Optimization; Peer to peer networks; Servers; Centralized distribution; Energy efficient networking; File distribution; Heterogeneous access; Modelling framework; Peer to peer solution; Performance; Research communities; Energy efficiency","Verma, K.; Universidad Carlos III de MadridSpain; email: vermasharp@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",19366442,,,,"English","Peer-to-Peer Netw.

For learning, spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) may be implemented using an energy efficient waveform superposition on memristor based synapse. However, system level implementation has three challenges. First, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short voltage-spikes which is disturbed by large voltage-waveforms that are simultaneously applied on the same memristor for real-time learning i.e. the simultaneous read-write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly replicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware. Third, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this paper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the learning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in real-time, asynchronously - avoiding non-biomimetic clocking based complex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit-simulator) with MATLAB® (mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an example, the hardware shows 97.5% accuracy in classification which is equivalent to software for a Fisher's Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is implemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO2 memristor. We show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the hardware performance (85%), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM characteristics specifically for SNN. © 2017 IEEE.","Fischer Iris dataset; Iris classification; Memristors; RRAM; RRAM cross-point array; SPICE; Spiking neural network; Synaptic-time-dependent-plasticity","Biomimetics; Circuit simulation; Classification (of information); Computer software; Energy efficiency; Hafnium oxides; MATLAB; Memristors; Neural networks; RRAM; SPICE; Cross-point array; Fischer Iris dataset; Iris classifications; Spiking neural networks; Time dependent; Hardware",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061815,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031012273

Physiologically, stress is observed to act through hypothalamus which modulates the autonomic nervous system mainly via sympathetically mediated effects. Utilizing this theory, a model based inference engine was developed for the estimation of stress. A computational model was used to generate a series of synthetic photo-plethysmogram (PPG) signals by varying the model parameters. Now using these artificial generated PPG signals, the inverse problem of estimating the stress parameter 'FSN' was solved by a neural network, using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The inference engine was then tested by using real PPG data collected twice (morning and evening) from a set of 13 subjects. As observed in experimental studies, our inference engine was able to replicate the pattern of stress levels i.e., exhibiting high levels of stress in mornings compared to evenings. These results validate the efficiency of the developed inference engine in estimating the stress. © 2017 IEEE.","Arterial dynamics; Mathematical Modelling; Neural networks; Stress; Sympathetic Nervous system","Computation theory; Estimation; Inverse problems; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Stresses; Arterial dynamics; Autonomic nervous system; Computational model; Estimation of stress; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Photo-plethysmogram; Stress estimation; Sympathetic nervous systems; Engines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509067480,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

A small subset of machine learning algorithms, called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are considered as state-ofthe-A rt for many applications (e.g. video/audio classification). The main challenge in implementing the CNNs, in embedded systems, is their large computation, memory, and bandwidth requirements. To meet these demands, dedicated hardware accelerators have been proposed. Since memory is the major cost in CNNs, recent accelerators focus on reducing the memory accesses. In particular, they exploit data locality using either tiling, layer merging or intra/inter feature map parallelism to reduce the memory footprint. However, they lack the flexibility to interleave or cascade these optimizations. Moreover, most of the existing accelerators do not exploit compression that can simultaneously reduce memory requirements, increase the throughput, and enhance the energy efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we present a flexible accelerator called MOCHA. MOCHA has three features that differentiate it from the state-of-the-art: (i) the ability to compress input/kernels, (ii) the flexibility to interleave various optimizations, and (iii) intelligence to automatically interleave and cascade the optimizations, depending on the dimension of a specific CNN layer and available resources. Post layout Synthesis results reveal that MOCHA provides up to 63% higher energy efficiency, up to 42% higher throughput, and up to 30% less storage, compared to the next best accelerator, at the cost of 26-35% additional area. © 2017 IEEE.","Accelerators; Computer architecture; Convolutional Neural Networks; Reconfigurable computing","Acceleration; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Convolution; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Neural networks; Particle accelerators; Reconfigurable architectures; Bandwidth requirement; Convolutional neural network; Dedicated hardware; Layout synthesis; Memory footprint; Memory requirements; Reconfigurable computing; State of the art; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538639146,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Multi-robot cooperation employing equilibrium-based reinforcement learning is optimal in the sense of system resource (time and/or energy) utilization, because of the prior adaption of the environment by the robots. Unfortunately, robots cannot enjoy such benefit of reinforcement learning in presence of multiple types of equilibria (here Nash equilibrium or correlated equilibrium). In the above perspective, robots need to adapt with a strategy, so that robots can select the optimal equilibrium in each step of the learning. The paper proposes consensus-based multi-agent Q-learning to address the bottleneck of the optimal equilibrium selection among multiple types. An analysis reveals that a consensus (joint action) is coordination type pure strategy Nash equilibrium as well as pure strategy correlated equilibrium. The superiority of the proposed consensus-based multi-agent Q-learning algorithm over the traditional reference algorithms in terms of the average reward collection is shown in the experimental section.

The work in this direction mainly aims at reducing dynamic energy consumption that includes clock gating, cache subbanking, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling of underlying processors. However, the emergence of fast and compact transistor sizes has exponentially added onto the processor static power consumption, which has not been paid much attention. This article proposes a duplication-controlled static energy-efficient scheduling (C-SEED) algorithm for scheduling precedence constrained applications on parallel computing systems. The C-SEED algorithm couples adaptive threshold-based duplication with system level dynamic power management technique to achieve its objectives. Dynamic power management works by selectively putting the energy-consuming resources to efficient low-power states for idle times to reduce energy consumption. Efficacy of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and compared against other relevant works on the basis of makespan and total energy (dynamic + static + communication) consumption. The extensive simulation results carried over large set of random and regular task graphs show that the proposed C-SEED algorithm has potential to reduce energy consumption as well as makespan.

There is a wide range of applications which get benefited from such network. Unprocessed multimedia transmission is always expensive in terms of processing power, storage, and bandwidth. So, data processing is a challenge in WMSN. Exploring low-overhead data compression technique is a solution towards this problem. In this work we propose an energy saving image compression technique for WMSN using curve fitting technique considering the application of post-disaster situation analysis through image capturing of the affected area. Upon employing the method on the macroblocks of sensory image, curve fitting coefficients are generated and transmitted towards the sink thereby saves energy by transmitting reduced volume of data. Finally the design feasibility along with simulation results including statistical analysis is presented to evaluate efficacy of the scheme in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and peak signal to noise ratio.

It encompasses arms, ammunition weapons, tools and confidential data. A large number of soldiers are active at the national borders and hostile regions to safeguard the civilian people and enhance the security to them; though, in the case of any emergency, some mechanism based on the modern electronics and technology is essential to alert the military officers active in surveillance areas so that they can make a prompt arrangement to lock the security and tighten the forces. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication which can play an effective role in the monitoring of the remote areas for applications like military surveillance, seismic activity monitoring, earthquake detection and disaster relief operations etc. The nodes are randomly deployed in the sensor field for such applications because of which the density of nodes in some part of the area to be monitored will be more and other areas might be very less. Another problem is the physical access to sensor nodes in these areas is extremely challenging, so the human intervention is not easy. Thus, the replacement of nodes or recharging their batteries is practically impossible. The paper presents a prototype model of the surveillance system for the military application using wireless sensor networks and the work progress accomplished till now has been reported.

Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the apphcation and network architecture. There is a design trade-off between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. This paper provides method for clustering and cluster head selection to WSN to improve energy efficiency. It presents a comparison between LEACH and R-LEACH on the basis of the network lifetime. In this paper, we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system hfetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. Further, we modify one of the most prominent wireless sensor networks routing protocol LEACH as R-LEACH by introducing efficient cluster head replacement and inter cluster communication.

Efficient energy utilization has been a primary concern in choosing routes from primary and secondary caches. Because of frequent movement of nodes energy consumption in MANET becomes a need. Generally failures of a route happen during the data transmission. Break age of routes leads to greater delay and increased delay. So there is an essential for a cost effective procedure for data communication. This paper proposes an Efficient Source Initiated Multipath Protocol based on Dynamic Routing Protocol (DSR) Protocol (ESIM-DSR). NS-2 is used for simulating the results.

New cellular devices are equipped with powerful computing, communicating and storage facilities which will improve scalability, energy efficiency and decrease packet delay, etc. The performance metrics like coverage, enhanced target tracking and superior channel capacity can be increased by using mobile sink over a static sink in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). On the other hand Mobile Cellular Network (MCN) has technology of wide coverage area, powerful nodes and network robustness but it's deployment is expensive. Therefore, integration of MCN and WSN is the need of the hour. This integrated type of communication network minimizes the data loss which is an important challenge that occurs at medium access control (MAC) layer. Therefore Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for data flow is emerging issues which need to be solved. In this paper, we study the issues in convergence of MCN and WSN with respect to MAC layer.

In this model, the set of ""active"" elements to be covered changes over time. The goal is to maintain a near-optimal solution for the currently active elements, while making few changes in each timestep. This model is popular in both dynamic and online algorithms: in the former, the goal is to minimize the update time of the solution, while in the latter, the recourse (number of changes) is bounded. We present generic techniques for the dynamic set cover problem inspired by the classic greedy and primal-dual offline algorithms for set cover. The former leads to a competitive ratio of O(log nt), where nt is the number of currently active elements at timestep t, while the latter yields competitive ratios dependent on ft, the maximum number of sets that a currently active element belongs to.

Since, the sensor is a battery operated device the lifetime of each sensor is reduced. Therefore effective cluster formation and routing is needed to prevent the sensor node to die earlier. The existing approach consumes excess energy during routing. This was due to increased overhead on the cluster head that has to perform all the work. The proposed work introduces a technique named as Honey Bee Optimization that aims to reduce the energy consumption by finding an optimal route with low cost. The proposed approach is to extend the lifetime of a network and throughput and it delivers better performance than existing method in terms of the energy efficiency, link quality, and scalability.

The collection of enormous amount of homogenous sensor nodes forms the Wireless Sensor Network. These sensor nodes have restricted battery power and memory and so the limited amount of energy is considered as the major issue. To overcome this issue several mechanisms were proposed, among them clustering is a popular way which minimizes the consumption of energy in the sensor nodes and thus the life span of the Wireless Sensor Network can be increased. Grouping the sensor nodes in an energy efficient and distributed approach is considered as the important issue in clustering. Hotspots problem and energy hole problem are the problems faced by the non-distributed clustering. So in order to triumph over these issues, a Fuzzy Based Dynamic Clustering (FDC) in Wireless Sensor Network is proposed. Also a new fitness function for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed which discovers the possible cluster heads The hotspots problem and energy hole problem is overcome by the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which chooses unique radius for each cluster head thus unequal clustering is formed. A fair comparison is done between this proposed algorithm and some existing algorithms.

Therefore, data dissemination is hampered and the volunteers and different disaster management agencies find it difficult to communicate among them. Fortunately, a sizeable population (around 35%-45%) these days owns various wireless devices like smart phones, tablets etc. with multiple communication interfaces (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct). These devices with their alternative communication capabilities can be harnessed in a disaster aftermath in order to disseminate situational information. However, the procedure to disseminate such information through these devices should be simple enough so that minimal technical expertise is required from the user end. Several Android based applications are available which offers data forwarding service based on Wi-Fi direct. All such applications provide only unicast mode of communication while lacking to provide multicast and broadcast services. In this paper we provide a complete solution Disaster Messenger, an Android based application which allows the volunteers to disseminate information in absence of network infrastructure (through Wi-Fi direct) in unicast, multicast and broadcast mode. We perform rigorous field experiments to evaluate the performance of Disaster Messenger by varying movement speeds of the nodes and distance between the nodes. We also evaluate its performance in terms of energy efficiency. The comparison of the Disaster Messenger with a couple of well-known file sharing applications namely SHAREit and BitTorrent Sync reveals that Disaster Messenger outperforms SHAREit and BitTorrent Sync in terms of energy efficiency and data transfer rate in unicast mode. Due to unavailability of any competing application which supports multicast and broadcast services, we have not been able to compare the performance of our application for the said services. © 2016 IEEE.","Android application; Energy efficiency; Information forwarding; Post-disaster communication; Situational information","Android (operating system); Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Multicasting; Wi-Fi; Alternative communication; Android applications; Communication infrastructure; Communication interface; File sharing application; Information forwarding; Post-disaster communications; Situational information; Information dissemination",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

However, cooperation in spectrum sensing (SS) is often vulnerable to several security threats; one such operation is primary user emulation attack (PUEA). To address the issues, an optimization framework is developed in this work to minimize the energy consumption in cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in presence of PUEA using log-likelihood ratio test (LLRT) at the fusion center (FC) while maintaining a target sensing reliability. Sensing reliability is characterized by a high detection probability and a low false alarm probability. FC is assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas, where each one receives signal from a particular secondary user along-with PUEA signal. FC computes a global test statistics by combining all log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). Simulation results highlight performance gain in energy consumption at low sensing duration over the existing energy detection based approach. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; Cooperative spectrum sensing; LRT; Optimization; Relay","Data communication systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimization; Statistical tests; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks; False alarm probability; High detection probability; Log-likelihood ratio test; Optimization framework; Primary user emulation attack (PUEA); Relay; Cognitive radio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

During emergency, it is very difficult to collect necessary information from the mobile devices if there is unavailability of networks. In this work, an Energy Efficient Emergency Management System named as E3M has been proposed. E3M supports peer-to-peer communication between mobile devices if a mobile device does not find any suitable networks for communication with the cloud. To make E3M energy efficient, it selects best available mobile device by forming coalition among devices. One device among them is selected for data communication based on the residual energy of devices if there is no target device found in the range of the source device. The simulation results indicate that E3M is suitable for emergency conditions where, mobile devices do not find any suitable networks. That means E3M also works in the absence of any network by considering wireless mesh network technology. © 2016 IEEE.","Coalition; Emergency; Mobile cloud computing; Residual energy","Civil defense; Cloud computing; Disasters; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Mobile devices; Peer to peer networks; Risk management; Coalition; Emergency; Emergency conditions; Emergency management systems; Emergency situation; Peer-to-peer communications; Residual energy; Wireless mesh network technology; Mobile cloud computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The sensor nodes are connected to a coordinator or a data collector to form a WBAN. WBAN consists of variety of medical and non-medical applications with aggregate data rate requirement ranging from few bytes per second to 10Mbps. These applications are having relatively different energy saving, reliability and quality of service (QoS) requirements. The existing MAC protocols present in various short and medium range wireless technologies such as 802.11 and 802.15.4 have been designed for specific purposes, and therefore, do not fulfill the diverse performance requirements across all WBAN applications. In this paper, we propose a poll-based MAC protocol (PMAC) for WBAN, which can meet such a diversified functional requirements of various WBAN applications. In particular, we introduce few concepts in polling based channel access mechanism to make an energy efficient and QoS aware MAC protocol.

There exist a number of factors that affect the consumption of battery, in these devices, such as the running apps, hardware resources such as CPU, GPU, display, mobile network, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth radios used by the applications. The non-optimized use of the various system resources will lead to inefficient battery usage in the device. This work studied the average power consumption by the mobile devices as a function of space and time in various scenarios. The variation in power consumption may be contributed by one or more components in different space-time scenarios. One of the main components that causes variation in power consumption is mobile radio. The mobile radio power consumption varies with changes in signal strength and, therefore, energy consumption varies with space and time. The unwanted energy drain in some scenarios can be controlled by carefully identifying spots where high energy consumption can occur and managing the device properly. Based on our study, we propose a classification of the spatio-temporal energy consumption characteristics of the network interface of mobile computing devices into three categories: (i) positively correlated, (ii) negatively correlated, and (iii) neutral, based on the energy consumption and RSSI observations. We identified the scenarios where battery drain becomes high and developed a system to provide alert mechanism that alerts a user to take appropriate actions in such situations so that power can be saved. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy consumption; Energy consumption rate; Energy efficiency; Mobile Computing; Spatio-temporal optimization","Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile computing; Wi-Fi; Energy consumption rates; Hardware resources; High energy consumption; Mobile computing devices; Number of factors; Reducing energy consumption; Spatio-temporal optimizations; System resources; Display devices",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Most of the routing protocols available in the literature are prone to high control overhead and are less efficient. An elastic routing technique utilizing overhearing feature, is an efficient protocol with less control overhead for routing the data, from a single static source to a mobile sink. But, when there are multiple static sources, the delivery of data to the mobile sink pose huge delay and high traffic. Here we propose an efficient routing algorithm utilizing the feature of overhearing to route the packets from all the source nodes to the mobile sink. We use a modified version of iterative-1 Steiner tree algorithm with elastic routing, for finding the shortest path to the mobile destination, with minimum control packet overhead. Calculation of Steiner points is dynamic in nature, so as to adapt to the topological changes. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is better in-terms of data rate, energy efficiency and control overhead. Test-bed results indicate that the proposed approach can be used effectively in WSN, where topological changes are frequent. © 2016 IEEE.","Dynamic Topology; Elastic Routing; Mobile WSN; Steiner Tree","Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Topology; Trees (mathematics); Control-packet overhead; Dynamic topologies; Efficient protocols; Elastic Routing; Mobile destinations; Mobile WSN; Steiner trees; Topological changes; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In the design of any algorithm for WSN, the major constraint is limited battery life time of the sensor nodes. Most of the existing work on combined problem of coverage and connectivity either require the clocks of the nodes to be synchronized or require exact location information of the nodes to be known. In this paper, we present an Asynchronous Algorithm which is Energy Efficient and provides integrated Coverage and Connectivity, called (AAEECC). Our algorithm does not require clock synchronization of nodes at any stage neither does it require exact location information of the nodes. It is low cost, fully distributed and scalable. In the following, we discuss the approach used. First, we build a minimum hopcount graph for connectivity. Second, we propose a scheduling algorithm for providing desired coverage. Third, we define a fault tolerant connectivity maintenance algorithm (FTCM) to re-ensure connectivity as network may become disconnected due to scheduling. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Clocks; Energy efficiency; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Asynchronous algorithms; Battery life time; Clock Synchronization; Connectivity maintenance; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient coverages; Location information; Surveillance applications; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

For this purpose, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerging, connecting vehicles with static road side units (RSUs) serving as a backbone. For energy efficiency, vehicles may upload data to the nearest RSU by multi-hop routing via shortest paths. But it drains the energy of the nodes nearer to the RSU faster leading to frequent recharging of batteries. For cost-efficient design and longer battery life, both optimal placement of RSUs and uniform power dissipation of nodes are necessary in VANETs. In this paper, a novel approach of load balanced routing is proposed to improve the network stability and battery lifetime in individual nodes. Assuming variable energy levels of transmission in each vehicle, our analysis establishes some upper bounds on the separation of two consecutive RSUs for nearly load balanced routing. The problem has been defined for linear network with uniform distribution of vehicles over 1-D road.

This trend would sustain in future communication networks as well, especially in the Wi-Fi networks. This could be attributed to rapid growth of business and institutional entities and the need for cellular data off-loading for which localized Wi-Fi networks are preferred due to higher offered data rate. In such networks, a major portion of energy consumption occurs at the access network entities making energy efficient operation of Wi-Fi access points (APs) extremely crucial. In this paper, an actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning (RL) framework is designed to enable traffic based ON/OFF switching of APs in Wi-Fi network. Furthermore, previously estimated traffic statistics is exploited in future scenarios which speeds up the learning process and provide additional improvement in energy saving. The important feature of the present study is the validation of the proposed framework on real data collected from an institute's Wi-Fi network. The simulation results for 20 APs of a Wi-Fi network shows that the proposed framework can lead to around 75% saving in energy consumption as compared to the case when AP switching is not considered. © 2016 IEEE.","Actor-critic algorithm; Energy saving in Wi-Fi networks; Reinforcement learning; Transfer learning","Education; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Reinforcement learning; Traffic surveys; Actor-critic algorithm; Data-intensive services; Energy efficient operations; Exponential increase; Performance analysis; Transfer learning; Wi Fi networks; Wi-fi access points; Wi-Fi",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A number of issues including energy efficiency, reliability, optimal use of network bandwidth need to be considered for designing any multi-hop communication protocol for WBANs. Energy consumption depends on many factors like amount and frequency of forwarding traffic, node activity, distance from sink etc. Energy consumption gives rise to other issues like heated nodes. Existing routing protocols are mostly single hop or multi-hop, and generally focus on one issue ignoring the others. In this paper, we first identify the sources of energy drain, and then propose a 2-hop cost based energy efficient routing protocol for WBAN that formulates the energy drain of a node due to various reasons and incorporates it in the routing decision. Relative node mobility due to posture change is also considered here. The protocol is simulated in Castalia simulator and compared with state of the art protocols. It is found to outperform state of the art protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio for a given transmission power level. Moreover, only a small number of relays are found to be sufficient to stabilize packet delivery ratio. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; Relay nodes; Routing; Sensor; WBAN","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Routing protocols; Sensors; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Energy efficient routing protocol; Multi hop communication; Relay node; Routing; State-of-the art protocols; Transmission power levels; WBAN; Wireless body area network; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

Thus energy efficient execution of real time tasks in such large systems has found to be promising research area in recent time. Scheduling tasks in such large systems using only low level power construct like DVFS is not efficient.

We have analyzed the instantaneous power consumption and the overall energy consumption of the proposed policy along with other five baseline policies for a wide variety of synthetic data sets and real trace data.

Among the various wireless domains, Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Networks (WDSN) pose a good support to the dynamics that arise when the nodes are induced with mobility. In the Zigbee based Wireless Dynamic Sensor Network (WDSN), major consideration is on utilizing the energy efficiently among the mobile nodes. Various techniques are used to attain energy efficiency in Zigbee WDSN. Among them, clustering the nodes is one of the best methods, since they aim at reducing the energy dissipation and increasing the life span of the network. Hence, in this paper, the performance of Zigbee WDSN using clustering scheme is done by considering the nodes with mobility and compared with performance of Zigbee WDSN using non clustering technique. The proposed work is summarized as follows: the network is deployed as clusters and the remaining energy of the node is determined by utilizing clustering protocol. In each cluster, the clustering protocol opts for the node with the maximum remaining energy as the head of that cluster. Then STR algorithm is utilized to route the sensed data from the member nodes to the cluster head. Hence, the clustering technique and STR, route the information through the shortest path paving the way for enhanced average residual energy and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The simulations are done by using ns2 and performance metrics such as average residual energy and PDR are computed and analyzed for non clustered and clustered method. © 2017 IEEE.","clustering; residual energy; STR; WDSN; Zigbee","Cluster analysis; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Average residual energy; clustering; Clustering techniques; Dynamic sensor networks; Packet delivery ratio; Performance analysis; Residual energy; WDSN; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037155,,,"English","Int.

The aim of this paper is to realize different types of combinational circuits like full-adder, full-subtractor, multiplexer and comparator using reversible decoder circuit with minimum quantum cost. Reversible decoder is designed using Fredkin gates with minimum Quantum cost. There are many reversible logic gates like Fredkin Gate, Feynman Gate, Double Feynman Gate, Peres Gate, Seynman Gate and many more. Reversible logic is defined as the logic in which the number output lines are equal to the number of input lines i.e., the n-input and k-output Boolean function F(X1, X2, X3,..., Xn) (referred to as (n, k) function) is said to be reversible if and only if (i) n is equal to k and (ii) each input pattern is mapped uniquely to output pattern. The gate must run forward and backward that is the inputs can also be retrieved from outputs. When the device obeys these two conditions then the second law of thermo-dynamics guarantees that it dissipates no heat. Fan-out and Feed-back are not allowed in Logical Reversibility. Reversible Logic owns its applications in various fields which include Quantum Computing, Optical Computing, Nano-technology, Computer Graphics, low power VLSI Etc., Reversible logic is gaining its own importance in recent years largely due to its property of low power consumption. The comparative study in terms of garbage outputs, Quantum Cost, numbers of gates are also presented. The Circuit has been implemented and simulated using Xilinx software. © 2017 IEEE.","Garbage Outputs; Number of Gates; Quantum Cost; Reversible Gates","Boolean functions; Computation theory; Computer graphics; Costs; Decoding; Logic gates; Optical data processing; Quantum computers; Signal processing; Timing circuits; Comparative studies; Forward-and-backward; Garbage output; Low-power consumption; Number of gates; Quantum costs; Reversible gates; Reversible logic gates; Computer circuits",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037155,,,"English","Int.

Instead of preparing all clusters at once, a peeling - off strategy is adopted. Data model of graph representation and weighted edges of similarity is used. The similarity among objects is made free from effects of any control parameter using histogram equalization. Proposed method is an iterative method of detecting a dominant set, growing a cluster around it and peeling it off to have a reduced data set for next iteration. The proposal is for pattern recognition where irregular shaped clusters are common. Hence, experiments are performed over such popular datasets which have clusters of odd shapes and different sizes. © 2017 IEEE.","arbitrary shaped clusters.

Ensuring energy efficiency through inexpensive feature extraction technique is another motivation. Consequently, in this paper, a machine learning based activity monitoring framework is proposed that provides device independence using inexpensive time domain features.

The key parameters that play a major role in designing a protocol for WSNs are its energy efficiency and computational feasibility, as sensor nodes are resource constrained. Variation in sensor nodes distance from base station and inter node distances primarily cause unequal energy consumption among the sensor nodes. The energy consumption varies with time and causes degradation of system performance. LEACH is the first ever clustered based routing protocol which provides elegant solutions, suffers from the drawback due to the randomized cluster head (CH) election. Assuming serious energy rebalancing with traditional clustering algorithm, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based clustering algorithm which evaluates the fitness function by considering the two major parameters distance and energy has been proposed in this paper.

Photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most focused RES due to plenty than other sources. Before serving to the load, the generated power by solar array is treated electronically and this process is called 'power conditioning'. In power conditioning, two major functions are frequently discussed i.e. DC-AC conversion and maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In order to supply the maximum power to the load, it is desired to operate the solar array at its maximum power point (MPP). Maximum Power Point Tracker automatically and electronically matches the load with the array. There are various techniques to determine the maximum power point. In this paper, one soft computing technique is discussed for this purpose i.e. Fuzzy Logic. With the fuzzy logic based control technique, the duty cycle of the boost converter is controlled in order to obtain the maximum power from PV array.

Energy losses are occurring mostly on the edges of wireless sensor network, where most of the packet drops are occurred. In order to avoid this energy loss problem this paper has introduced concept of advance/ super node which can be deployed at edges of the network or inside to the network. For the cluster head selection both the methods e.g. clustering technique and direct communication are employed to minimize energy consumption loss.

It is considered as one of the most promising 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced technologies for improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of Proximity-based Services (ProSe). However, due to interference posed by the D2D transmitters to the primary cellular users, intelligent resource allocation techniques need to be incorporated for the betterment of the overall system. Overlay D2D communication avoids the interference between cellular and D2D users by dedicating resources for D2D users. With this approach, efficient use of the dedicated Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) among D2D users is still a concern. To handle the issue of optimum spectral efficiency, efficient allocation of spectrum resources is essential among D2D users. For the first time, we address this problem and propose a PRB allocation scheme that maximizes the PRB utilization among D2D users. The proposed scheme spreads the PRB requirement of a D2D pair over multiple PRBs while reducing the transmit power over each PRB, thereby reducing the overall interference and improving the spectral efficiency of the network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our scheme does better than the conventional PRB allocation scheme (of assigning PRBs based on their data rate demand), by increasing the overall throughput and energy efficiency of the network. To analytically evaluate the proposed PRB allocation scheme, we present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the coverage and average rate of the network, and conclude that the link SINR of the D2D pairs is actually improved on employing our proposed scheme which results in high coverage and overall rate of the system. Finally, we propose a Q-Learning algorithm that learns the optimum number of PRBs to dedicate for overlay D2D communication based on the PRB demand of the cellular and D2D users. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm efficiently allocates PRBs to the D2D pairs when compared to the conventional static scheme of dedicating fixed number of PRBs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular network; Channel assignment; Energy efficiency; Overlay D2D communication; Power control; Q-Learning; Stochastic geometry","Geometry; Learning algorithms; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Power control; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; Channel Assignment; D2D communications; Q-learning; Stochastic geometry; Energy efficiency","Swain, S.N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: siba@cse.iitm.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

This is the simplest method of broadcasting of RREQ packets but it often results in broadcast storm problem, originating collisions and congestion of packets in the network. A probabilistic broadcasting is one of the widely used broadcasting scheme for route discovery in MANETs and provides solution for broadcasting storm problem. But it does not consider limited energy of the battery of the nodes. In this paper, a new energy efficient probabilistic broadcasting (EEPB) is proposed in which probability of broadcasting RREQs is calculated with respect to remaining energy of nodes. The analysis of simulation results clearly indicate that an EEPB route discovery scheme in ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) can increase the network lifetime with a decrease in the average power consumption and RREQ packet overhead. It also decreases the number of dropped packets in the network, in comparison to other EEPB schemes like energy constraint gossip (ECG), energy aware gossip (EAG), energy based gossip (EBG) and network lifetime through energy efficient broadcast gossip (NEBG). © 2016, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Broadcast storm; EAG; EBG; ECG; Energy; MANET; NEBG; Overhead; Probability; Route discovery","Broadcasting; Electrocardiography; Energy efficiency; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Probability; Routers; Storms; Broadcast storm; Energy; MANET; NEBG; Overhead; Route discovery; Mobile ad hoc networks","Kumar, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Jamia Millia IslamiaIndia; email: er.sumitkumar21@gmail.com",,"Springer India",22502106,,,,"English","J.

Cluster-based approaches are popularly used for its energy efficiency where some nodes designated as Cluster Heads (CHs) organize WSNs for data aggregation and energy saving. The CH is responsible for gathering data from the cluster nodes and conveying it to the base station due to which higher energy drain occurs at CH leading to uneven network degradation.

So, there is a need for cognitive radio that will meet the multi-scenario requirements or context aware cognitive radio communication system for the heterogeneous network.

The proven clustering approach is used to organize nodes in the network into logical groups to attain energy efficiency, network scalability, and stability for improving the sensing accuracy in CR through cooperative spectrum sensing. In this paper, a distributed dynamic load-balanced clustering algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, each member in the cluster is to calculate the cooperative gain, residual energy, distance, and sensing cost from the neighboring clusters to perform the optimal decision. Each member in a cluster participates in selecting a cluster head through cooperative gain, and residual energy that minimise network energy consumption and enhances the channel sensing. First, we form the number of clusters using the Markov decision process model to reduce the energy consumption in a network.

Additionally, operational expenditure due to energy consumption in femtocell and backhaul links is another disquiet. Hence, it is of utmost interest to minimize the capital and operational expenditure to accelerate the rural and remote femtocell deployments.

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a promising technology for delivering quality healthcare to its users. Low power devices attached to the body have limited battery life. It is desirable to have energy efficient routing protocols that maintain the required reliability value for sending the data from a given node to the sink. The current work proposes two protocols: Optimized Cost Effective and Energy Efficient Routing protocol (OCER) and Extended-OCER (E-OCER). In OCER, optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the multi-objective cost function with residual energy, link reliability and path loss as its parameters for selecting the most optimal route from a given body coordinator to the sink. Distance between any two sensor nodes is reduced by applying multi-hop approach. E-OCER extends the work of OCER by considering inter-BAN communication. Performance of OCER is compared with other existing energy aware routing protocols by considering different parameters. A comparison of the performance of E-OCER with OCER is made to study the effect of on-body sensors communication on the energy consumption and throughput of the network. This paper also provides a comprehensive energy model to calculate the total energy consumption of the network. In addition to the radio transmission and receiving energy, other basic energy consumption sources viz. processing energy, sensor sensing, transient energy and transmission/reception on/off energy have also been taken into account. The results show an improved performance of the proposed protocols in terms of energy efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy aware; Routing protocol; WBAN","Chip scale packages; Cost effectiveness; Cost functions; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Power management; Radio transmission; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Comprehensive energy model; Cost-effective solutions; Energy aware; Energy consumption sources; Energy efficient routing protocol; Total energy consumption; WBAN; Wireless body area network; Power management (telecommunication)","Singh, S.; University Institute of Engineering and Technology(UIET), Panjab University, Sector-25, India; email: sukhdalip@pu.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017644864

The gestures are captured by Microsoft's Kinect sensor. The work is segmented into four main parts. The first stage describes a “relax” posture through four centroids depicting four portions of the skeletal structure. In the second stage, when the subject is showing symptoms of any one of the 16 physical disorders, then the skeletal structure distorts; the bilateral structure is lost, and concept of “centroid” computation does not seem relevant. Hence, in the second stage, “motion points” depicting shifted centroids for the distorted posture are computed by distance maximization with respect to the four corresponding centroids obtained for the relax posture. This process is carried out by adapting the weights assigned to each joint by differential evolution. In the third stage, eight features are figured out on the basis of Euclidean distances and angles among the motion points of the distorted gesture. In the final stage, gestures are recognized using an interval type-2 fuzzy set-based classifier with 91.37% accuracy. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","differential evolution; gesture recognition; health care applications; hybrid system; interval type-2 fuzzy set; Kinect sensor","Computation theory; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Differential Evolution; Distance maximizations; Euclidean distance; Health care application; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Kinect sensors; Microsoft's kinect; Skeletal structures; Gesture recognition","Saha, S.; Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineering Department, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: sahasriparna@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02664720,,EXSYE,,"English","Expert Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019587348

The main challenge in acoustic sensor networks is to maintain the energy level balance among the nodes, throughout the entire lifetime of the network. Hence, a Balanced Multi-objective Optimized Opportunistic Routing (BMOOR) is proposed to forward the packet through multi-hop from downstream node to upstream node, so as to reach the sink at the surface. The proposed method refashions the nodes based on the dynamic estimations with respect to energy and the selection of optimal forwarders along the depth in a three dimensional network. In contrast to the existing techniques, the proposed protocol does not require spatial location, which is very expensive in UWSN. This in turn overcomes the fear of the single node getting trapped during greedy forwarding. The proposed method is further optimized using meta-heuristic, generation based bio-inspired algorithm (Bat) for delay minimization and delivery ratio maximization. Bat algorithm optimizes the opportunistic path by random fly with respect to fitness till it converges to an optimal pareto front, thereby the network lifetime is enhanced. Extensive simulation study using NS2 with an underwater simulation package proved that BMOOR contributes significant performance improvements over other representative UASN routing protocols. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bat algorithm; Energy efficiency; Opportunistic routing; Optimization; Underwater acoustic sensor networks","Acoustic devices; Acoustic equipment; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Multiobjective optimization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Underwater acoustics; Acoustic sensor networks; Bat algorithms; Bio-inspired algorithms; Extensive simulations; Opportunistic routing; Three-dimensional networks; Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Underwater sensor networks; Optimization","Kanthimathi, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University Regional CampusIndia; email: kanthimathi.research@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978880768

This has led to the Dark Silicon problem, wherein only a fraction of transistors can operate at maximum frequency and nominal voltage, in order to ensure that the chip functions within the power and thermal budgets. Heterogeneous computing systems which consist of General Purpose Processors (GPPs), Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and application specific accelerators can provide improved performance while keeping power dissipation at a realistic level. For the accelerators to be effective, they have to be specialized for related classes of application kernels and have to be synthesized from high level specifications. Coarse Grained Reconfigurable has been proposed as accelerators for a variety of application kernels. For CGRAs to be used as accelerators in the Dark Silicon era, a synthesis framework which focuses on optimizing energy efficiency, while achieving the target performance is essential. However, existing compilation techniques for CGRAs focuses on optimizing only for performance, and any reduction in energy is just a side-effect. In this paper we explore synthesizing application kernels expressed as functions, on a coarse grained composable reconfigurable array (CGCRA). The proposed reconfigurable array comprises HyperCells, which are reconfigurable macro-cells that facilitate modeling power and performance in terms of easily measurable parameters. The proposed synthesis approach takes kernels expressed in a functional language, applies a sequence of well known program transformations, explores trade-offs between throughput and energy using the power and performance models, and realizes the kernels on the CGCRA.

Fast data delivery from source node to sink node is also required for many applications. Sometimes data transmission towards the sink may be interrupted because of failure of nodes in a particular area. The various such requirements of routing data in a WSN are sometimes contradictory and routing algorithms must be designed keeping in mind all these requirements. In this paper three routing algorithms are proposed for multi-sink partitioned network. In these three algorithms, the source nodes or intermediate nodes select a next node to forward the data to the destination or sink. This process repeats until the data reaches the sink. In the first technique, the next node is chosen considering its distance from sink node as a criterion. In the second technique, remaining energy of the neighboring nodes is used as a criterion for selection of the next node. The combination of these two criteria is considered in the third technique and a multiple criteria decision analysis technique is used. A recovery technique from area failure is also proposed and incorporated in the above mentioned algorithms.

A huge competition prevails among the cloud Service Providers (SPs) to offer eco-friendly and economically viable cloud services. Heterogeneous Cluster System (HCS) forms the backbone of such computing resources and for eco-friendly services, minimal energy consumption in HCS is a challenging issue. It not only brings down the operational cost but enhance the system reliability and other environmental veneration as well. Commonly, a green Service Level Agreement (SLA) is made between cloud users and SP. Green SLA ensures that a certain percentage of makespan of the schedule is sacrificed for an energy efficient schedule. This work proposes a scheduling framework to execute heterogeneous independent jobs on a HCS. It also introduces a SLA based negotiation scheme for makespan, energy and cost referred as “Makespan, Energy and Cost Negotiator (MECN)”. The proposed model utilizes all possible empty slacks of the schedule running on Processing Elements (PEs) and extended makespan (due to SLA). Using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technique, it provides an energy efficient schedule. A resource replacement strategy is also incorporated, in the proposed framework, to generate a cost effective schedule without sacrificing its performance. The performance of the model is analyzed by its simulation which reflects its usefulness and effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); Green SLA; Heterogeneous Cluster System (HCS); Job scheduling; Makespan","Cluster analysis; Cluster computing; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Distributed database systems; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Power management; Scheduling; Voltage scaling; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Green SLA; Heterogeneous clusters; Job scheduling; Makespan; Energy efficiency","Kumar, N.; ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology & ManagementIndia; email: dgoldneetesh15@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012266395

Neighbor discovery (ND) is an essential phase in the initialization of a wireless adhoc network, where a quick, accurate, and energy efficient ND protocol has major importance to consequent operations in wireless networks. However, the speeds of recent ND techniques are still not sufficient fast and fundamentally restricted by the limitations of half-duplex, and not much energy efficient to discover continuously for neighbors. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed full-duplex and energy-efficient group based ND technique.

At the same time, SBUs and MBUs in the CM can permanently or temporarily affect the hardware circuit implemented on FPGA. Hence, error mitigation and recovery techniques are necessary to protect the FPGA hardware from permanent faults arising due to such SBUs and MBUs. Different existing techniques used to mitigate the effect of soft errors in FPGA have high overhead and their implementations are also quite complex. In this paper, we have proposed efficient single bit as well as multi-bit error correcting methods to correct errors in the CM of FPGAs using simple parity equations and Erasure code. These codes are easy to implement, and the needed decoding circuits are also simple. Use of Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) along with a simple hardware scheduling algorithm based download manager helps to perform the error correction in the CM without suspending the operations of the other hardware blocks. We propose a first of its kind methodology for novel transient fault correction using efficient error correcting codes with hardware scheduling for FPGAs. To validate the design we have tested the proposed methodology with Kintex FPGA. We have also measured different parameters like fault recovery time, power consumption, resource overhead and error correction efficiency to estimate the performance of our proposed methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","DPR; Erasure code; FPGA; Hardware scheduling; MBU","Codes (symbols); Energy efficiency; Error correction; Errors; Fault tolerant computer systems; Forward error correction; Hardware; Radiation hardening; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Configuration memory; Decoding circuits; Dynamic partial reconfiguration; Erasure codes; Error correcting code; Fault recovery time; Recovery techniques; Soft error mitigations; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Mandal, S.; Variable Energy Cyclotron Center, HBNI,1/AF Bidhannagar, India; email: swaga89@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01419331,,MIMID,,"English","Microprocessors Microsyst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009204976

At the same time, without proper scheduling it may lead to high collision, delay and drop rate. This can be overcome by a proposed Enhanced Delay Sensitive Data Packet scheduling (EDSP) algorithm. This algorithm mainly focus on reduction of the delay and increase in the network lifetime and energy efficiency. This proposed EDSP algorithm follows three rules for proper scheduling such as medium selection, weight calculation and priority scheduling. After assigning the source and destination node, by using the AODV routing protocol shortest path with lesser number of relay nodes will be found. Then the source node data flows will be stored in the queue, when the queue size starts to increase, a particular threshold rate scheduling is required. Scheduling checks the channel medium, based on the busy or idle state, node may be sleep or awake state respectively. If the state is busy, all the data flows will be stored in the buffer. If the state is idle, buffered data will move to queue and then forward based high weighted data as first priority. Simulation results have analyzed the performance of the proposed algorithm in two different stages by varying the queue size of 50 and 100 cm. The proposed algorithm has increased the network lifetime and energy efficiency and decreased the delay and drop rate. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Delay sensitive packet; Drop rate; Less delay; Network lifetime; Packet scheduling","Algorithms; Data transfer; Drops; Energy efficiency; Packet networks; Power management (telecommunication); Queueing theory; Routing protocols; Scheduling; Delay sensitive packets; Drop rates; Less delay; Network lifetime; Packet scheduling; Scheduling algorithms","Padmavathy, C.; Department of IT, Sri Ramakrishna Engineering CollegeIndia; email: cpadmavathycc@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973129562

In trust based security model, decision is taken based on some specific behavior, and so it has uncertainty. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty and has tolerance of imprecise data with high power of precision. In this study, fuzzy logic based multi-attribute trust model is suggested. The proposed trust model has message success rate, elapsed time at node, correctness and fairness as trust metrics. Once the four trust values are calculated, fuzzy computational theory is applied to compute the final trust value of every node that can be anyone of low (l), medium (m) and high (h).

For a particular network topology, it is hard to discover optimum quantity of cluster-heads as well as their positions.

These applications require quality-of-service (QoS) aware multicast routing protocol to deliver the same data stream to a predefined group of receivers. Since nodes in wireless networks are severely energy constrained due to finite battery source, hence it is of paramount importance that QoS aware multicast routing protocol be energy efficient. Transmission power control is one of the methods used to save energy. In this method, the nodes dynamically adjust the transmission power so that energy consumption in the tree is minimized. However, reduction in the transmission power increases the number of forwarding nodes in the multicast tree. This negatively impacts the QoS in terms of propagation delay, delay jitter, and packet loss etc. In wireless networks, there is a trade-off between the energy consumption and the QoS guarantees provided by the network. We unify these requirements into a multiobjective framework referred to as Energy Efficient QoS Multicast Routing (E2QoSMR). The goal is to simultaneously optimize the total power consumption and the QoS parameters in the multicast tree. We extend two algorithms based on metaphor of swarm intelligence for finding an energy efficient multicast tree satisfying the QoS guarantees. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the correctness and efficiency of the algorithms. The simulation result of the algorithms is compared with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III.

This paper proposes a hybrid clustering energy aware routing protocol (H-CERP) for heterogeneous WSNs. H-CERP is designed to form efficient clusters with less cluster head count than the optimal estimation and uses multihop communication with gateway nodes to communicate with the base station.

Binary Welded Tree (BWT), or glued tree, is one of the most well-known quantum walk algorithms in the continuous-time domain. Prior work implements quantum walk on the BWT with static welding. In this context, static welding is randomized but case-specific. We propose a solution to automatically generate the circuit for the Oracle for welding.

Data loss as a result of massive transmission over such degraded link significantly affects the network lifetime. Therefore, this work proposes link quality based adaptive data streaming as a solution for effective deployment of low power Zigbee. Initially to determine the quality using RSSI and LQI indicator, an enhanced link quality estimation technique (ELQET) is designed with an intuitive combination of the Kalman filter and fuzzy logic. The quality score returned by fuzzy utilizing four efficient link metrics PRR, ASNR, ALQI, and SA is further smoothened with exponential weighted moving average filter for stability. Consequently the estimated quality is categorized into good/poor quality to stream data at high/low transmission rate respectively between the LPC2148s via CC2550 transceiver. Here, two contrasting RSSI and LQI data sets are furnished as input to ELQET and categorized into good link with quality of about 61 % and poor link with a quality of about 50 %. The straight forward low computation technique is WSN propitious and exhibits high performance with RMSE of 0.0133.

The main challenges of CRAHNs now a day address the main issues of spectrum scarcity and underutilization. Due to the lack of channel sensing, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is the main challenge in CRAHNs. Efficient CSS is more essential to enhance the detection of performance by utilizing the theoretical studies of spatially distributed secondary users (SUs). This paper uses the priority-based two-stage detection model (PBTSDM) to analyze the cooperation strategy among secondary users (SUs) and primary users (PUs).

Swarm intelligence (SI) based metaheuristic like Ant colony optimization, Particle swarm optimization and more recently Artificial bee colony (ABC) has shown desirable properties of being adaptive to solve optimization problem of energy efficient clustering in WSNs. ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs due to ease of implementation however, its search equation contributes to its insufficiency due to poor exploitation phase and storage of certain control parameters. Thus, we propose an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved search equation to enhance its exploitation capabilities and in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student’s-t distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Student’s-t distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient bee clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherit the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads and improve energy efficiency in WSNs.

Therefore, there is a scope for improvement in monitoring approaches. For the purpose, the paper has presented multi-parametric sensors network topology (MPST). The topology has polyhedron infrastructure to observe the temporal and spatial variations like electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, chloride and dissolved oxygen; in shallow river water. Its main features are energy efficient, in-expensive infrastructure that requires less manpower, sustainable and can cope with varying currents of water. The MPST is tested at Sutlej river, Bassi, Ludhiana in India and the generated results are analyzed on various physical parameters.

(i) Unique detection with SDD ATPG patterns over transition delay fault (TDF) ATPG patterns is often not easy to establish due to the large volume of the former and the insistence on coverage due to the latter. (ii) Lack of a seamless method to target SDD patterns for nodes which are embedded in paths with small slack and TDF patterns for the other nodes further inhibits SDD ATPG. In this paper, we present methods to address both these limitations. We describe a method for targeted SDD pattern generation for SDQL (statistical delay quality level) improvement across logic modules in multiple clock domains (at different frequencies) based on slack intervals. We also describe a method to incorporate patterns corresponding to other fault models suitably (namely TDF and PDF - path delay fault) to improve the SDQL metric without significant pattern volume inflation. Results on a large SOC indicate a reduction in the test pattern volume ranging from 45% to 92%, and an SDQL improvement ranging from 48% to 85%, as compared to standard methods in use today. © 2017 IEEE.","Pattern optimizations; Sdql improvement; Small delay defect atpg","Defects; Logic devices; VLSI circuits; Computation methods; Different frequency; Multiple clock domains; Pattern optimization; Sdql improvement; Significant patterns; Small Delay Defects; Transition delay faults; Computation theory",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781509044825,85OWA,,"English","Proc IEEE VLSI Test Symp",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020179494

Analytical solutions to duopolistic competition draw on principles of game theory and require simplifying assumptions such as symmetrical payoff functions, linear demand and linear cost. Such assumptions can reduce the practical use of duopolistic models. In contrast, we use an evolutionary algorithmic approach (EAA) to determine the Nash equilibrium values. This approach has the advantage that it can deal with and find optimum values for duopolistic competition modelled using non-linear functions. In the paper we gradually build up the competitive situation by considering non-linear demand functions, non-linear cost functions, production and environmental constraints, and production in discrete bands. We employ particle swarm optimization with composite particles (PSOCP), a variant of particle swarm optimization, as the evolutionary algorithm. Through the paper we explicitly demonstrate how EAA can solve games with constrained payoff functions that cannot be dealt with by traditional analytical methods. We solve several benchmark problems from the literature and compare the results obtained from EAA with those obtained analytically, demonstrating the resilience and rigor of our EAA solution approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Constrained games; Evolutionary algorithm; Nash equilibrium; Non-linear payoff functions; Swarm intelligence","Competition; Computation theory; Cost functions; Functions; Game theory; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Algorithmic approach; Constrained games; Environmental constraints; Nash equilibria; Non-linear payoffs; Nonlinear cost functions; Simplifying assumptions; Swarm Intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms","Brady, M.; DCU Business School, Dublin City UniversityIreland; email: malcolm.brady@dcu.ie",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008890546

OppNets consist of a network of mobile devices that cooperate with each other to forward messages from the source to the destination. However, in a practical real-world setting, nodes behave selfishly and do not choose to be cooperative all throughout. This selfish behavior could be exhibited due to a variety of reasons, ranging from lower energy levels of the node to memory or buffer shortages. Thus, it is imperative to develop incentivizing mechanisms that reward nodes that are cooperative and penalize nodes that are selfish. In this paper, we present a novel routing protocol called SEIR that is able to reduce energy consumption of nodes as well as incentivize them to participate in message routing. SEIR is based on the Stackelberg game theoretic model and decides the optimal reward to give relay nodes to eliminate their selfishness and improve chances of successful message delivery. Subsequent simulations performed show that SEIR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of energy efficiency and message delivery in an OppNet with selfish nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy-Aware Routing; Game Theory; Incentive Mechanism; Opportunistic Networks; Stackelberg Game","Delay tolerant networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Game theory; Network routing; Power management; Routing protocols; Wireless ad hoc networks; Delaytolerant networks (DTNs); Energy-aware routing; Incentive mechanism; Network connectivity; Opportunistic network (Oppnets); Opportunistic networks; Reduce energy consumption; Stackelberg Games; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047802,,,"English","Annu.

Routing and forwarding in Oppnets remains a challenging task because of the limited energy and bandwidth constraints. Various routing protocols for Oppnets have been proposed in the literature, but only few of them have explicitly investigated the energy issue. In this paper, some improvements in the already existing history-based prediction for routing protocol for infrastructure-less Oppnets (so-called HBPR) is suggested so as to make it energy efficient. The proposed energy-efficient HBPR protocol (EHBPR) addresses the energy constraints in HBPR and reduces the number of packets transferred in the network, which in turn results to a reduction in the nodes' energy consumption. Through simulations, the performance of EHBPR in terms of energy consumption is compared against the HBPR and the energy-efficient n-epidemic routing protocol. The results show that (1) EHBPR consumes 14.66% less energy than HBPR (respectively 13.14% less energy than n-epidemic); (2) EHBPR generates 67.4% less dead nodes compared with HBPR (resp. 66.33% less dead nodes compared to n-epidemic); and (3) EHBPR yields 77.86% less overhead ratio compared with HBPR (resp. 84.49% less overhead ratio compared with n-epidemic).

We introduce and study two important special cases of the classical $BRIBERY problem, namely, FRUGAL-BRIBERY and FRUGAL-$BRIBERY where the briber is frugal in nature. By this, we mean that the briber is only able to influence voters who benefit from the suggestion of the briber. More formally, a voter is vulnerable if the outcome of the election improves according to her own preference when she accepts the suggestion of the briber. In the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem, the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes. In the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problem, the vulnerable votes have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint. We further formulate two natural variants of the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problem namely UNIFORM-FRUGAL-$BRIBERY and NONUNIFORM-FRUGAL-$BRIBERY where the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or different. The FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem turns out to be a special case of sophisticated $BRIBERY as well as SWAP-BRIBERY problems. Whereas the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problem turns out to be a special case of the $BRIBERY problem. We show that the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem is polynomial time solvable for the k-approval, k-veto, and plurality with run off voting rules for unweighted elections. These results establish success in finding practically appealing as well as polynomial time solvable special cases of the sophisticated $BRIBERY and SWAP-BRIBERY problems. On the other hand, we show that the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem is NP-complete for the Borda voting rule and the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problem is NP-complete for most of the voting rules studied here barring the plurality and the veto voting rules for unweighted elections. Our hardness results of the FRUGAL-BRIBERY and the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problems thus subsumes and strengthens the hardness results of the $BRIBERY problem from the literature. For the weighted elections, we show that the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem is NP-complete for all the voting rules studied here except the plurality voting rule even when the number of candidates is as low as 3 (for the STV and the plurality with run off voting rules) or 4 (for the maximin, the Copelandα with α∈[0,1), and the simplified Bucklin voting rules). In our view, the fact that the simplest FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem becomes computationally intractable for many important voting rules (except the plurality voting rule) even with very few candidates is surprising as well as interesting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Algorithm; Bribery; Computational social choice; Frugal; Manipulation; Theory; Voting","Algorithms; Budget control; Hardness; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Bribery; Computational social choices; Frugal; Manipulation; Theory; Voting; Computation theory","Dey, P.; Tata Institute of Fundamental ResearchIndia; email: palash@csa.iisc.ernet.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",03043975,,TCSCD,,"English","Theor Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015781387

In this work, we leverage the collective knowledge embedded in the social relationships of users on the network to predict user preferences and future behavior. We extract social dimensions in the form of overlapping communities that capture the behavioral heterogeneity in directed and signed social networks. We present an extension of signed modularity, namely Structural Balance Modularity (SBM). We first propose a metric Structural Balance Index (SBI) that determines users’ degrees of affiliation towards various communities by harnessing the concept of the generalized theory of structural balance. We then incorporate SBI into the signed modularity to define SBM. It takes into account the density as well as the sign (positive or negative) of the links between users on the network. A genetic algorithm is developed that optimizes the SBM, thereby maximizing positive intra-community connections and negative inter-community connections. The discovered latent overlapping communities represent affiliations of users with similar preferences and mutual trust relationships captured by the signs of connections exerting differential effects on users’ behaviors. Thereafter, we ascertain which communities are relevant for a targeted behavior by using discriminative learning. The computational experiments are performed on Epinions real-world dataset, and the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of our proposed approach. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Collective behavior prediction; Collective intelligence; Community detection; Genetic algorithm; Signed social networks; Structural balance","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge management; Business applications; Collective behavior; Collective intelligences; Community detection; Computational experiment; Discriminative learning; Overlapping communities; Structural balance; Social networking (online)","Awal, G.K.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: awal.gaganmeet@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13873326,,,,"English","Inf.

The first challenge that computer architects encounter is identifying 'what to specialize in the program'. We demonstrate that this requires precise enumeration of program paths based on dynamic program behavior. We hypothesize that path-based [4] accelerator offloading leads to good coverage of dynamic instructions and improve energy efficiency. Unfortunately, hot paths across programs demonstrate diverse control flow behavior. Accelerators (typically based on dataflow execution), often lack an energy-efficient, complexity effective, and high performance (eg. branch prediction) support for control flow. We have developed NEEDLE, an LLVM based compiler framework that leverages dynamic profile information to identify, merge, and offload acceleratable paths from whole applications. NEEDLE derives insight into what code coverage (and consequently energy reduction) an accelerator can achieve. We also develop a novel program abstraction for offload calledBraid, that merges common code regions across different paths to improve coverage of the accelerator while trading off the increase in dataflow size. This enables coarse grained offloading, reducing interaction with the host CPU core. To prepare the Braids and paths for acceleration, NEEDLE generates software frames. Software frames enable energy efficient speculative execution on accelerators. They are accelerator microarchitecture independent support speculative execution including memory operations. NEEDLE is automated and has been used to analyze 225K paths across 29 workloads. It filtered and ranked 154K paths for acceleration across unmodified SPEC, PARSEC and PERFECT workload suites. We target NEEDLE's offload regions toward a CGRA and demonstrate 34% performance and 20% energy improvement. © 2017 IEEE.","Braids; Energy Efficiency; Frames; Hardware Accelerators; Hyperblocks; LLVM; Program analysis; Speculation; Synthesis; Traces","Acceleration; Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Hardware; Memory architecture; Needles; Program processors; Supercomputers; Synthesis (chemical); Weaving; Braids; Frames; Hardware accelerators; Hyperblocks; LLVM; Program analysis; Speculation; Traces; Energy efficiency",,,"IEEE Computer Society",15300897,9781509049851,,,"English","Proc.

Geographic routing mechanism is very much suitable for the highly energy constrained wireless sensor networks due to its less memory and computational overhead. The presence of holes can defeat the advantages of geographic routing mechanism and may even harm the objective of network deployment. This paper conducts a survey on the various types of holes, cause for their occurrence and various techniques to deal with them. The various mechanisms that are used to recover from holes tend to increase energy consumption of sensor nodes and thus affect network lifetime. Thus the survey concentrates on energy efficient mechanisms to handle holes with an aim to improve network connectivity and network lifespan that will extend the applicability of wireless sensor networks. © 2016 IEEE.","Connectivity; Holes; Network Lifetime; Wireless Sensor Networks","Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; MEMS; Network routing; Sensor nodes; Surveys; Computational overheads; Connectivity; Environmental parameter; Holes; Micro electro mechanical system; Mission critical applications; Network connectivity; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A simulation (using MATLAB/Simulink) study has been made on input single line to ground fault and inverter base drive open fault. The speed and accuracy of the fault diagnosis requires signal analysis using Digital Signal Processors. The signal analysis algorithms such as Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transforms are studied and compared. Current research is exploring on Expert Systems for fault diagnosis due to the dominant usage of power electronics drives in traction, ships, aerospace, elevators, conveyers and military applications. In the above systems, the advanced diagnosing techniques are essential to avoid inadvertent shutdown and to sustain fault tolerant mode of operation. Also, the VFDs are used as energy efficient devices in many industrial applications such as industrial grade air compressors, etc., and techniques for neutralizing the pulsating torque under faulty single phase mode of three phase induction motor are discussed. The simulation study using FFT and Wavelets for detecting faults has been done along with analysis, for knowledge on fault detection is most important to protect with upgraded system and to improve the reliability of solid state drives.

Hence the broadcast of electronic medical images over internet has become frequent. Due to lack of security levels in internet broadcast of electronic medical image is always susceptible to hackers and other breaches of security. Ensuring the security, integrity and robustness of digital medical image has become an important issue. In this paper a novel approach is proposed using Chao's theories and DNA encoding to provide the security for digital medical images. In the proposed method, firstly the input medical image is revamped into two DNA encoded matrices based on intensity levels. Later, for odd pixel value based DNA encoded matrix Chen's hyper chaotic map and for even pixel value based DNA encoded matrix Lorenz chaotic map are used to produce the chaotic sequences separately. The pixels positions of both DNA encoded matrices are snarled using these chaotic sequences. Finally, ADD operation is used for the addition of snarled both DNA encoded matrices to attain an encrypted image. The decrypted image is acquired by inverse process of encryption. From the experimental results it is proved that proposed algorithm enhances the security level. It sustains the integrity, robustness and efficiency of digital medical image encryption. © 2016 IEEE.","Chen's hyper chaotic map; Cryptography; decryption; DNA; medical mage encryption","Artificial intelligence; Broadcasting; Chaotic systems; Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital communication systems; DNA; DNA sequences; Image coding; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Medical imaging; Personal computing; Pixels; Chaotic map; Chaotic sequence; decryption; Digital communication networks; Digital medical images; Dna cryptographies; Internet broadcast; Medical image encryptions; Medical image processing",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

As there are a number of favorable properties associated with GFRP composites; but machining of GFRP is significantly different as compared to other engineering materials, because, GFRPs are non-homogeneous in nature (which consist of distinctly different phases), so that their machining operation is characterized by uncontrolled intermittent fiber fracture causing oscillating cutting forces and critical bending stresses, poor surface properties due to crushed fiber or resin pull out. For effective use of any machining process, it becomes important to find optimum parametric setting to achieve improved quality as well as increased productivity. In this present context, a case study on optimal machining parameters selection has been reported to ensure high productivity as well as satisfactory surface quality of machined glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites. Utility function based on Taguchi optimization approach has been proposed in this research. During GFRP drilling, fiber breakage, entry and exit delamination are encountered as the major issues leading to decrease in product quality and overall productivity of manufacturing processes and products.

Although, wireless sensor network is one of the upcoming technologies in the field of wireless communication, we find very less development of real time applications using the sensor networks. The main reason for this is the design of the motes to be deployed in the sensor field according to the requirement of application is difficult job and expensive in terms of investment of money. Moreover, the replacement of the batteries or repairing of the devices becomes a very challenging task as the human intervention in the deployment areas is next to impossible. Hence assurance of long lived sensor nodes and prolonged network life time can be impacted by inducing adequate amount of sleep scheduling to the nodes. This paper presents a communication protocol based on optimal back-off sleep time to give a right amount of sleeping to the sensing devices in the monitoring area due to which energy efficient coverage can be achieved. The advantage of the design is that based on the unused battery, randomly the sleep duration is calculated and given to the probing node by the active node. Hence, full utilization of the active node till it dies is ensured. The life of an individual node thus increases since the time of activity of it is smartly scheduled. The blacklisting of nodes like to be faulty or fail helps to overcome problem of node failure. The simulation of the protocol, analysis of the results and further scope of the development of the proposed design is discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient performance etc; Optimal backoff sleep time","Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuits; Investments; Power management (telecommunication); Sleep research; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Connectivity; Coverage; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient coverages; Human intervention; Real-time application; Sleep time; Wireless communications; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

It achieves enhanced performance over On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP). The proposed protocol finds energy efficient multicast routes from source node to a group of receivers. Multicast mesh creation involves two phases: a Join Query (J-Q) phase and a Join Reply (J-R) phase. The J-Q phase initiates a route discovery process to find routes of the multicast group. In J-R phase, different routes of the multicast groups are set up. In the proposed protocol, we modify ODMRP and introduce fuzzy inference system to deal with imprecise and partial information during the route discovery phase. The decision maker uses two fuzzy variables such as energy and distance for evaluating reward as an output parameter of each multicast route. This output parameter helps to distinguish different multicast route and it also helps to reduce the effect of mutual interference between routes. The proposed protocol is simulated using the NS-2 simulator.

In the two tier architecture of IoT, namely IoT layer and sensing layer, to have minimum hop communication and connectivity among the devices, we utilize two well known graph theory concepts namely dominating set and bipartite graph.

The videos of six different types of flow patterns namely, annular flow, bubble flow, churn flow, plug flow, slug flow and stratified flow are recorded for a period and converted to 2D images for processing. The textural and shape features extracted using image processing are applied as inputs to various classification schemes namely fuzzy logic, SVM and SVM with PCA in order to identify the type of flow pattern. The results obtained are compared and it is observed that SVM with features reduced using PCA gives the better classification accuracy and computationally less intensive than other two existing schemes.

Independent decimal floating point unit is becoming important in these areas. A floating point unit is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers. Floating point unit have been implemented as a coprocessor rather than as an integrated unit in various systems. Today's floating point arithmetic operations are very important in the design of Digital Signal Processing and application-specific systems. As Fixed-Point arithmetic logics are faster and more area efficient, but sometimes it is desirable to implement calculation using Floating-Point numbers.

Typically these other assumptions are made in an ad hoc fashion and may result in unnecessary rework, or worse, complete exclusion of some of the alternative solutions.

The distributed nature and dynamic topology of WSN introduces very special requirements in conserving energy and providing security. To address these challenges, technique like secure and energy efficient clustering scheme with data aggregation has been developed. The comparison between LEACH, M-LEACH and the proposed scheme with result analysis is presented in this paper. In this paper, we implement energy efficient clustering scheme [1][2][4][12][15][17][19] with aggregation of information to save the bandwidth requirement, which prolongs the lifetime of a network [8]. The proposed algorithm operates in two-phases. In the first phase clustering is done, in which sensor nodes compute potential score which is based on mobility pattern, density [5] and remaining energy [5] [8] in disseminated manner, then each node decides to become a cluster head(CH), by employing potential score. In second phase, every node chooses its CH [5] which has higher potential score. All cluster members will transmits the data to cluster heads for aggregation and encryption, which is then forwarded to the base station. The results proved that the proposed algorithm has better throughput, packet delivery ratio with reduced packet drop, lesser energy consumption and ensures data security compared with LEACH. © 2016 IEEE.","Clustering; Data aggregation; LEACH; MDC; Security; WSN","Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Leaching; Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; Data aggregation; Energy Efficient clustering; Mobile wireless sensor network; Packet delivery ratio; Secure data aggregations; Security; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045563,,,"English","Proc.

To overcome this challenge, we propose energy-efficient secured routing protocol. The objective of our work is to provide a secured routing protocol, which is energy efficient. To provide security for both link and message without relying on the third party, we provide security to the protocol by choosing a secure link for routing using Secure Optimized Link State Routing Protocol. Each node chooses multipoint relay nodes amongst the set of one-hop neighbors, so as to reach all two-hop neighbors. The access control entity authorizes nodes announcing the node identification to the network. In addition, the access control entity signs a public key Ki, a private key ki, and the certificate Ci required by an authorized node to obtain the group key. Each node maintains a route table with power status as one of its entry. After selecting the link, on requirement of a new route, we check nodes’ power status in its routing table and then accordingly arise a route. Then, we perform group key distribution using the generated keys using a small number of messages which helps reducing energy consumption. The group key can be altered periodically to avoid nonauthorized nodes and to avoid the use of the same group key in more than some amount of data. Then, we provide communication privacy for both message sender and message recipient using Secure Source Anonymous Message Authentication Scheme. Thereby, the message sender or the sending node generates a source anonymous message authentication for message for releasing each message based on the MES scheme. Hence, our approach will provide message content authenticity without relying on any trusted third parties. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","MANET; Multipoint relays (MPR); Routing protocol; Secure Optimized Link State Routing","Access control; Authentication; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Communication privacy; Group key distribution; MANET; Message authentication; Multipoint relays; Optimized Link State Routing; Optimized link state routing protocols; Reducing energy consumption; Power management (telecommunication)","Singh, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, KCET, Amritsar (IKG-PTU, Kapurthala)India; email: tejpreetsingh1520@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027912884

To overcome this challenge, we propose energy-efficient secured routing protocol. The objective of our work is to provide a secured routing protocol, which is energy efficient. To provide security for both link and message without relying on the third party, we provide security to the protocol by choosing a secure link for routing using Secure Optimized Link State Routing Protocol. Each node chooses multipoint relay nodes amongst the set of one-hop neighbors, so as to reach all two-hop neighbors. The access control entity authorizes nodes announcing the node identification to the network. In addition, the access control entity signs a public key Ki, a private key ki, and the certificate Ci required by an authorized node to obtain the group key. Each node maintains a route table with power status as one of its entry. After selecting the link, on requirement of a new route, we check nodes’ power status in its routing table and then accordingly arise a route. Then, we perform group key distribution using the generated keys using a small number of messages which helps reducing energy consumption. The group key can be altered periodically to avoid nonauthorized nodes and to avoid the use of the same group key in more than some amount of data. Then, we provide communication privacy for both message sender and message recipient using Secure Source Anonymous Message Authentication Scheme. Thereby, the message sender or the sending node generates a source anonymous message authentication for message for releasing each message based on the MES scheme. Hence, our approach will provide message content authenticity without relying on any trusted third parties. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","MANET; Multipoint relays (MPR); Routing protocol; Secure Optimized Link State Routing","Access control; Authentication; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Routing protocols; Communication privacy; Group key distribution; MANET; Message authentication; Multipoint relays; Optimized Link State Routing; Optimized link state routing protocols; Reducing energy consumption; Power management (telecommunication)","Singh, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, KCET, Amritsar (IKG-PTU, Kapurthala)India; email: tejpreetsingh1520@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028263833

We formulate an EE-balancing optimization problem that maximizes the ratio of the spectral efficiency (SE) over the total power dissipation subject to QoS and a limited transmit power constraints. The problem which maximizes the EE by jointly optimizing the subcarrier pairing, power allocation, and subcarrier allocation, turns out to be a non-convex fractional mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which has an intractable complexity in general. We apply a concave lower bound on the achievable sum rate and a series of convex transformations to make the problem convex one and propose an iterative algorithm for iteratively tightening the lower bound and finding the optimal solution through dual decomposition approach. In addition, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is investigated. We then characterize the impact of various network parameters on the attainable EE and SE of the network employing both EE maximization and SE maximization algorithms when the network is designed from the EE perspective.

Fuzzy system is capable of handling the various levels of uncertainties found in the input data taken from the traffic signals.

It learns patterns in terms of n-dimensional hyper line segment (HLS). Modified fuzzy hyperline segment neural network (MFHLSNN) is a modified version of FHLSNN that improves the quality of reasoning and recall time per pattern using modified fuzzy membership function. However, for the large training patterns MFHLSNN creates a large number of HLS, which increases training and recall time and thus, is limited only to smaller dataset on sequential machines/implementations. In this paper, we proposed a new fuzzy membership function for MFHLSNN. Using new membership function architecture is called Updated FHLSNN (UFHLSNN). We also proposed GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel implementation of UFHLSNN, for larger pattern datasets, using NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The updated membership function is found superior than the original one, in terms of number of arithmetic operations. The maximum speed-up achieved in training and recognition phases are 12× and 29×, respectively for the used datasets.

Sensor nodes transmit their data towards the static sink in a multi-hop manner. Sensor near the static sink contains all data of other sensors and its own data and thus it drains their energy very fast. So balancing energy throughout the network is important. Efficient utilization of energy is the main objective in WSN for maximization of a network's lifetime. For reducing the energy-hole problem in WSN a mobile sink approach is used. Mobility in WSN contains movement of the node around the network which consumes energy efficiently. However frequently changing the sink topology, determines the energy consumption. Moving the sink node is an effective solution for improving the lifetime of WSN. There are different methods in the literature schedule sink movements and determine sink stay points. Here the mobility of sink node can be considered based on distance of the Cluster Head (CH). Here mobile sink node checks the distance from the all CHs and moves the mobile sink to less distance CH. It also finds out the intersection points of two CHs. Depending on the intersection points mobile sink will move in between and collect data from the both CHs. Hence using this approach mobility will reduce and efficiently consumes more energy in network. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes and Mobility; Wireless sensor network","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Balancing energy; Critical problems; Effective solution; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy-hole problems; Intersection points; Network lifetime; Sink mobility; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509013388,,,"English","Int.

In this context, a dynamic hash key based integrated RC4 stream cipher with the hash function using nonlinear feedback shift register (NFSR) is proposed in this paper. Unlike the existing stream ciphers, the novelty of this proposed hash-based stream cipher algorithm is to generate a dynamic key using NFSR. The proposed algorithm is coded using Verilog HDL to produce dynamic binary key stream and implemented on commercially available FPGA device Virtex 5 xc5vlx110t-2ff1136. The implementation result in the FPGA device achieves the data throughput of 482 Mbps, operates at a maximum clock frequency of 60.31 MHz and it is improved in terms of efficiency (throughput/area) compared to existing techniques.

Naturally occurring signals such as audio signals are having sparse nature in Fourier Domain. One such implementation of CS theory is also explained and demonstrated. Greedy Algorithm known as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is used in recovery process. © 2016 IEEE.","Compressive Sensing (CS); OMP; RIP; Sparsity","Computation theory; Recovery; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Compressive sensing; Continuous monitoring; Incomplete measurements; Meteorological parameters; One dimensional signal; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Sparse representation; Sparsity; Compressed sensing",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

These nodes are formed by the wireless hosts, without using pre-installed infrastructure and do not use centralized administration. Routing protocol define a set of rules which regulates the flow of data packets from source to destination. Distinctive features of MANET makes the routing process complex, therefore the routing protocol is very significant for determining the network performance and its networking capacity. Important issue is Energy consumption as mobile nodes in Ad hoc use battery power for operation. In this paper comparison between performance of Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is done. We have also analyzed the routing protocol AODV as well as DSR using NS-2 simulator, the obtained results show that DSR consume 40% less energy as compared to AODV. © 2016 IEEE.","AODV; DSR; Energy consumption; MANET","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Routers; Routing protocols; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc on demand distance vector; AODV; Centralized administration; Dynamic source routing; Energy efficient routing protocol; MANET; NS-2 simulators; Wireless communications; Mobile ad hoc networks",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

In envisaged applications of WSN such as detection of forest fire, military surveillance est. battery replacement of sensor nodes are not feasible due to their deployment in hazardous areas and consequently all data routing protocols should be energy efficient. Hierarchical Routing Protocol (HRP) in WSN rotates different responsibilities among nodes with an aim to preserve energy. In this paper we propose a new HRP coined as FCM-ACO for WSN. The deployed nodes are partitioned into fixed clusters by the base station (BS) using Fuzzy C Means (FCM). The cluster heads (CH's) are locally selected from clusters based on residual energy and proximity to BS. Data flows from non cluster head nodes (non-CH) to their respective CH and is aggregated by the latter. An upper chain consisting of the CH's is constructed by BS using ant colony optimization (ACO) along with the selection of a super leader (SL). Data flows along the upper chain being fused at every node except the terminal ones to the SL which transmits directly to BS. We have done extensive Matlab simulations and results indicate FCM-ACO extends WSN lifetime in comparison to LEACH, LEACH-C, PEGASIS and DFCP.

Homogeneous broad transmission distance protocol (HM-BTDP) is put forward for event-specific and field-specific applications where sub-periods of lifetime are also important along with stability period and entire span of the network. Performance parameters for evaluation are alive nodes metrics depicting that this protocol outperforms the previous existing homogeneous protocols and thus enhancing network energy efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.","Cluster Head; Energy Efficiency; Network Lifetime; Stability Period; Wireless Sensor Network","Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Sensor nodes; Application specific; Cluster head; Energy efficient communications; Event-based applications; Network lifetime; Performance parameters; Sensor network systems; Transmission distances; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053841,,,"English","IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

Recent breakthroughs in analog and digital signal processing yield the feasibility of over 100 dB SIC capability, and make it possible for FD communications to demonstrate nearly doubled spectrum efficiency for pointto- point links. Now it is time to shift at least partially our focus to FD networking, such as in cellular networks. FD networking has more complicated interference environments. Therefore, its performance improvement is not that straightforward compared with half-duplex networking. Before putting FD networking into practice, we need to understand to which scenarios FD communications should be applied under the current technology maturity, how bad the performance will be if we do nothing to deal with the newly introduced interference, and most importantly, how much improvement could be achieved after applying advanced interference management solutions. We will discuss all these questions in this article. In particular, we will investigate advanced interference management solutions, including power control and user scheduling, and show that up to 91 percent spectrum efficiency gain and 110 percent energy efficiency gain of FD cellular networks over its HD counterpart can be achieved by applying these solutions. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"Digital signal processing; Digital television; Energy efficiency; Interference suppression; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power control; Scheduling; Signal processing; Wireless networks; Cellular network; Current technology; Interference environments; Interference management; Point-to-point link; Self-interferences; Simultaneous transmission; Spectrum efficiency; Finite difference method",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",01636804,,ICOMD,,"English","IEEE Commun Mag",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017095497

Recent research has looked at how to recognize human activities using smartphones, to indicate health status. But little attention has been paid to automatically identify the activity habits of individuals in real-time. Of course, the energy constraint in smartphones must be considered during the design of such cyber-physical recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based smart sensing strategy that is energy efficient and works in real-time. By making use of the temporal correlation property of real-world phenomena, an adaptive k-order Markov chain based prediction algorithm is proposed to avoid continuous sensing so that significant energy savings can be achieved. The prediction results are analyzed online in real-time, to ensure that the system can track an individual's behavior pattern and provide timely response to changes in behavior. Real-world experiments using our prototype show that such recognition oriented CPS systems can not only achieve energy savings, but also converge to steady state with high individual recognition accuracy, in a real-time manner. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The effectiveness of this proposed PeMOTLBO is tested on IEEE 33-bus and Indian 85-bus distribution system.

However, ERP system selection is a tedious and a time-consuming activity. The critical success factors (CSFs) serve as vital input ingredients to the ERP selection Models. It is however notable that, that none of the CSFs listing propagated by the researchers find a straightforward application in the selection procedure. The paper bridges the gap between the two thrust areas by proposing a framework for applying the prioritized CSFs listed for direct utilization in the selection process. An exhaustive review on the ERP selection techniques reveals the focus on AHP and/or the Fuzzy Logic approaches to ERP selection problem.

Auditor-Trust has been calculated using the data generated by Nasuni, a cloud storage company which evaluates CSPs on the basis of their Performance, Availability, Scalability, and Accuracy. Final Trustworthiness is then calculated by combining Direct-Trust, Public-Review, and Auditor-Trust. All the simulations have been done using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox of MATLAB.

With the optimal power allocation solution derived according to each policy, we show that the optimal partner selection can be obtained using the bottleneck matching (BM) algorithm and the maximum weighted matching (MWM) algorithm for GLM and MWTP policies, respectively. Since partner selection with the BM algorithm is not power efficient, we propose a novel minimum BM (MBM) algorithm to solve the optimal partner selection problem for the GLM policy. We further propose a suboptimal partner selection (SPS) algorithm for these policies with lower time complexity, compared with the optimal partner selection schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed partner selection and power allocation strategies based on the GLM policy have better network lifetime performance over the strategies based on the MWTP policy and achieve significant network lifetime improvement over conventional strategies of minimizing the total power per transmission, with and without an equal power constraint. Compared to the MBM and SPS algorithms, partner selection based on the BM algorithm for the GLM policy has inferior network lifetime performance at a low update interval. We show that partner selection based on the MBM algorithm achieves maximum network lifetime performance and that partner selection with the SPS algorithm performs very close to it. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Cooperative communication; end-to-end symbol error rate (SER); energy efficiency; lifetime maximization; matching algorithm; partner selection; power allocation","Energy efficiency; Fading channels; Lifetime maximization; Matching algorithm; Partner selection; Power allocations; Symbol error rate (SER); Cooperative communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189545,,ITVTA,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Diverse paradigm of Computational intelligence (CI) including Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), Reinforcement learning (RL), Artificial immune systems (AIS), and more recently, Artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic have been used for energy efficient clustering in WSNs. Due to ease of use and adaptive nature, ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs. However, its search equation, which is comparably poor at exploitation and require storage of certain control parameters, contributes to its insufficiency. Thus, we present an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve its exploitation capabilities. Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student′s−t distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Student′s−t distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherit the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads (CHs) and improve energy efficiency in WSNs. Simulation results shows that the proposed clustering protocol outperforms other well known protocols on the basis of packet delivery, throughput, energy consumption, network lifetime and latency as performance metric. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficient clustering; Improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic; Wireless sensor networks","Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet protocols; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Artificial Immune System; Energy Efficient clustering; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Exploration and exploitation; Metaheuristic; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Energy efficiency","Singh Mann, P.; Research Scholar, I K Gujral Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: psmaan@hotmail.com",,"Academic Press",10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012247176

The continuous pressure asserted by these applications is so large that even versatile WiMAX networks are facing stiff challenges in fair distribution of resources to these real- and non-real-time applications. Maintenance of fairness and flagrant quality of service levels among various applications is only possible with adaptive and intelligent scheduling mechanism. Design of such system is only possible if artificial intelligence is embedded in base station scheduler. This paper proposes mechanism for allocation of resources in WiMAX networks utilizing fuzzy logic principles. The proposed mechanism guarantees that latency and throughput requirements of real- and non-real-time traffic classes are met. Variations in incoming traffic have been exploited and used in decision making for offering bandwidth to maintain effective performance levels for all traffic classes. The proposed scheduler considers requests from subscribers and exploits powers of fuzzy logic to extract new weights for queues serving various traffic classes in a WiMAX network on the basis of most recent values of latency, throughput and share of traffic. The scheduling framework has been rigorously tested by performing versatile experiments for ensuring quality of service levels under hard hitting conditions. Fairness of scheduler has also been explored and results obtained are quite promising. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fuzzy logic; IEEE 802.16; QoS; Quality of service; Soft computing; WiMAX","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Decision making; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Soft computing; Telecommunication services; Wimax; Allocation mechanism; Effective performance; Fair distribution; IEEE 802.16; Incoming traffic; Intelligent scheduling; Non-real time traffics; Scheduling frameworks; Fuzzy logic","Sharma, A.; UIET, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: akashdeep@pu.ac.in",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",15622479,,,,"English","Int.

The parallelization is implemented through the use of message passing interface, which is suitable for distributed memory computers. The coupled-cluster equations are defined in terms of the reduced matrix elements, and solved iteratively using Jacobi method. The ground and excited states of coupled-cluster wave functions obtained from the code could be used to compute different properties of closed-shell and one-valence atom or ion. As an example we compute the ground state correlation energy, attachment energies, E1 reduced matrix elements and hyperfine structure constants. Program summary Program Title: RCCPAC Program Files doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/34rwtn27nb.1 Licensing provisions: MIT licence Programming language: FORTRAN 90 Nature of problem: Compute the ground and excited state wave functions, correlation energy, attachment energies, and E1 transition amplitude and hyperfine structure constant of closed-shell and one-valence atoms or ions using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. Solution method: The basic input data required is an orbital basis set generated using the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian. For the present case, closed-shell and one-valence systems, the orbitals are grouped into occupied, valence and virtual. The relativistic coupled-cluster equations of the single and double excitation cluster amplitudes, which form a set of coupled nonlinear equations, are defined in terms of reduced matrix elements of the residual Coulomb interaction. The equations are solved iteratively in parallel using Message Passing Interface (MPI) with the Jacobi method. However, to overcome the slow convergence of the method, we use Direct Inversion in the Iterated Sub-space (DIIS) to accelerate the convergence. For enhanced performance, the two-electron integrals and 6j- symbols are precalculated and stored. Furthermore, to optimize memory requirements, selected groups of integrals are computed and stored only by the thread which needs the integrals during computation. Restrictions: For efficient computations, the two-electron reduced Coulomb matrix elements consisting of three and four virtual states are stored in RAM. This limits the size of the basis set, as there should be sufficient space in RAM to store all the integrals. Unusual features: To avoid replication of data across the cores, and optimize the RAM use, the three particle and four particle two-electron Coulomb integrals are distributed. That is, following the loop structure in the driver, each core stores only the integrals it requires. With this feature there is enormous reduction in the RAM required to store the integrals. Additional comments: The code can be modified, with minimal changes, to compute properties other than electromagnetic transitions and hyperfine constants with appropriate modifications. The required modifications are addition of subroutine to compute the single-electron matrix element, and inclusion of calling sequence in the main driver subroutine. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Closed-shell and one-valence systems; Correlation energy; Coupled-cluster singles and Doubles approximation; Coupled-cluster theory; Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian; Relativistic coupled-cluster theory","Atoms; Cluster analysis; Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Electrons; Excited states; FORTRAN (programming language); Ground state; Hamiltonians; Ions; Iterative methods; Jacobian matrices; Message passing; Nonlinear equations; Random access storage; Shells (structures); Wave functions; Correlation energy; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles; Coupled-cluster theory; One valence; Relativistic coupled-cluster theory; Numerical methods","Angom, D.; Theoretical Physics Division, Physical Research Laboratory, Navarangpura, India; email: angom@prl.res.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",00104655,,CPHCB,,"English","Comput Phys Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009289169

The reliable delivery is only possible when the routing protocols are efficient and secure. Because of lack of resources it is not possible to use existing cryptosystems to provide security in WSN. But, trust aware routing can provide the security with lesser resources, which become popular in last three to four years. In this paper, a new energy efficient and trust aware reliable opportunistic routing (TAEROR) protocol is proposed. The protocol consists of a trust metric and also a relay selection algorithm. The trust aware metric detects the malicious nodes on the basis of forwarding sincerity, energy consumption and acknowledgement sincerity. Relay selection algorithms avoid these malicious nodes to get selected in the routing process. The protocol is simulated and compared to existing trust aware routing protocols. Proposed protocol TEAROR presents better results than the other compared protocols. © Copyright 2017, IGI Global.","Energy efficiency; Opportunistic routing; Sensor; Trust; WSN","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Malicious nodes; Opportunistic routing; Relay selection; Reliable delivery; Routing process; Trust; Trust metrics; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"IGI Global",19478186,,,,"English","Int.

Using quantum-inspired representation the complete binary search space can be generated by collapsing a single Q-bit string repeatedly. Thus, even a population size of 1 can be taken in a QIEA implementation resulting in enormous saving in computation. Although this is correct in theory, QIEA implementations run into trouble in exploring large search spaces with this approach. The Q-bit string has to be initialized to produce each possible binary string with equal probability and then altered slowly to probabilistically favor generation of strings with better fitness values. This process is unacceptably slow when the search spaces are very large. Many ideas have been reported with EAs/QIEAs for speeding up convergence while ensuring that the algorithm does not get stuck in local optima. In this paper, the possible features are identified and systematically introduced and tested in the QIEA framework in various combinations. Some of these features increase the randomness in the search process for better exploration and the others compensate by local search for better exploitation together enabling a judicious combination tailored for particular problem being solved. This is referred to as “right-sizing the randomness” in the QIEA search. Benchmark instances of the well-known and well-studied Quadratic Knapsack Problem are used to demonstrate how effective these features are—individually and collectively. The new framework, dubbed QIEA-QKP, is shown to be much more effective than canonical QIEA. The framework can be utilized with profit on other problems and is being attempted. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithm; Quadratic Knapsack Problem; Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Bins; Combinatorial optimization; Computation theory; Optimization; Population statistics; Random processes; Binary search; Binary string; Equal probability; Fitness values; Population sizes; Quadratic knapsack problems; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Search process; Evolutionary algorithms","Bansal, S.; Faculty of Engineering, Dayalbagh Educational InstituteIndia; email: sulabh.bansal.78@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14327643,,,,"English","Soft Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944559205

There is a passive eavesdropper (Eve) at the receiving end. We are interested in allocating rates and powers to the users fairly and reliably without the eavesdropper being able to decode the message. Initially we assume that each user knows only its own channel gain to the receiver and to the eavesdropper. When any user transmits a message, the receiver send an ACK if the message is decoded correctly and confidentially, else it sends a NACK. We use Multiplicative Weight no-regret algorithm to obtain a coarse correlated equilibrium. Next we maximize the weighted sum of utility of all the users and obtain Pareto optimal points. Since not all Pareto points are fair, we also obtain Nash Bargaining (NB) solutions which ensure certain fairness to all the users. In the next part of the paper we make more realistic assumption that each user knows only its own channel gain, and is ignorant of the channel gain to Eve (only its distribution is known). We use secrecy outage as the metric at the receiver to decide weather the message is correctly decoded or not.

Sensor nodes sense the environment periodically and forward the collected data to a sink. In a single sink WSNs, nodes closer to the sink become overburdened for relaying excessive data. This may incur faster energy consumption by nodes and lead an energy hole around the sink. As a result, the network lifetime is shortened. Multiple sinks mitigate this problem, reduce energy consumption at nodes and prolong the network lifetime by distributing the traffic over multiple sinks. This paper focuses on multiple sink placement problem and proposes two local search technique based energy aware multiple sink placement strategies for WSNs. The lifetime oriented approach based sink placement takes into account the lifetime of nodes and places the sinks at suitable locations such that the average network lifetime is increased. While the energy oriented approach focuses on minimizing the average energy consumption of the network. We evaluate the performance of both the strategies via simulations and compare them with random sink placement strategy. Simulation results highlight that the lifetime oriented approach improves the lifetime significantly. © 2017 IEEE.","average energy consumption; average network lifetime; communication tree; grouping; multiple sinks; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Average energy; grouping; Local search techniques; Multiple sinks; Network lifetime; Placement problems; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032600,,,"English","Proc.

SMD are constrained by their processing speed, storage capacity and many other resources, therefore, to make them to perform well with different types of applications, the concept of mobile cloud is used. Internet of Things (IoT) provides dynamic control and monitoring of energy resources enabling stakeholders to save energy usage at granular levels. With the advancement of IoT technologies and mobile cloud, a new concept is developed called as mobile cloud IoT (MCIoT) which is the convergence of both.

When an application is partitioned complex part is on the cloud and rest is on the SMD, the battery life of the SMD highly improves.

The paper introduces an algorithm for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks. It aims to conserve the battery power of sensors to be utilized for synchronization among the nodes in the network. The proposed synchronization approach is topology driven. In the existing literature, a wide range of protocols use flooding as the basic mechanism to create a topology. However, our method is based on the clustering of nodes with minimum hop distance from the cluster head and the chaining of cluster heads in order to create an energy-efficient topology. Also, it results in substantial reduction in the total transmission overhead. Further, it restricts the energy consumption in synchronizing the nodes of the network. Moreover, the approach avoids the loss of network coverage by electing a new cluster head in the event of cluster head failure. Finally, the simulation results exhibits that the proposed approach has significant energy savings as compared to many popular algorithms. © 2017 ACM.","Chaining; Clustering; Energy-efficiency; Synchronization","Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Synchronization; Topology; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Chaining; Clustering; Energy efficient algorithms; Energy efficient topologies; Network coverage; Substantial reduction; Time synchronization; Total transmission; Energy efficiency",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348683,,,"English","ACM Int.

Detailed investigations of Wireless NoC (WNoC) highlight their many benefits. But, idle-state power consumption associated with WI interfaces and routers is significantly high. To reduce the idle-state power consumption, a power gating technique can be incorporated with WNoC architectures. However, power gating can lead to adverse effects like IR drop, short-term sleep/wake up that increase the transient energy consumption specially for burst traffic, and also increases the cumulative settling time to get exact output response from the power gated components. To address these problems, we propose an energy-efficient transceiver for WNoC architecture using power gating. In this paper, we also present the details of techniques that minimizes the impact of power gating on performance. Proposed architecture saves up to 62.50% of idle-state power of WI as compared with traditional WNoC with minimum impacts of power gating method. This saves the overall packet energy on average by 49% compared to regular WNoC. Design considerations for augmenting power gating in WNoC and corresponding overheads are also presented. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy-efficient transceiver; impacts of power gating; seamless on-chip communication; wireless network-on-chip","Distributed computer systems; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Interface states; Network architecture; Radio transceivers; Routers; Servers; Transceivers; VLSI circuits; Wireless interconnects; Wireless networks; Design considerations; Energy efficient; Multi-core systems; Network-on-chip(NoC); NoC architectures; On chip communication; Power gatings; Proposed architectures; Network-on-chip",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

Because differential SA is vulnerable to the bias current offset in the differential legs. Thus, SRAM suffer from slow read speed or low read yield. This paper for the first time presents a novel differential-current-compensation based SA (DCC-SA) to suppress the effect of offset due to device mismatch on SA differential current. The proposed scheme is rigorously analyzed and compared to the conventional schemes. The proposed technique, enable DCC-SA to achieve 0.66× and 0.86× tighter offset distribution than conventional current latch SA (CLSA) and SA with offset compensation (SAOC) respectively, under similar cell current and bitline capacitance. We design a CMOS-logic-compatible, 65 nm, 4 Kb SRAM macro, using the DCC-SA. This technique possesses up to 31%, 55%, 35% and 69% lower energy/access and 0.58×,-1.27×, 0.53× and 0.41× lower resolution time (RT), compared to CLSA, SAOC, Schmitt Trigger (ST) based SA (STn-SA), and stacked SA (STk-SA) respectively at worst case process corners. Further, the standard deviation (σ) of delay for DCC-SA is reduced to 0.3× and 0.56×, 0.3× and 0.54× as that of CLSA, SAOC, STn-SA and STk-SA respectively. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Latch Sense Amplifier; inter die variations; intra die variations; Offset; SRAM","Capacitance; Dynamic random access storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit design; Static random access storage; VLSI circuits; Conventional currents; Conventional schemes; Differential current; inter die variations; intra die variations; Latch sense amplifiers; Offset; Offset compensation; Amplifiers (electronic)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

The single transistor latch effect, which can limit the operation of the device, can be effectively controlled by sidewall spacer engineering through the optimization of permittivity and thickness, and extend the usable range of device operation for dynamic memory applications. It is shown that through appropriate choice of sidewall spacer parameters, the extent of Impact Ionization (II) occurring in the device can be reduced through the influence of the vertical fringing field while still preserving the sharp increase in drain current which governs the hysteresis window at scaled gate lengths (50 nm) and lower supply voltages (0.9 V). A low permittivity wider sidewall spacer or high permittivity narrow spacer material is optimal for preserving device operation and avoiding STL. The work provides valuable insights into device design and demonstrates the significance of selecting appropriate sidewall spacer parameters as a way forward to overcome STL. © 2016 IEEE.","Dynamic Memory; Impact ionization; Junctionless; Latch; MOSFET","Drain current; Energy efficiency; Germanium; Impact ionization; Ionization; MOSFET devices; Permittivity; Semiconducting silicon; Static random access storage; Transistors; VLSI circuits; Device operations; Dynamic memory; Innovative approaches; Junctionless; Junctionless transistor; Latch; MOS-FET; Single transistors; Embedded systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

Hence there is a need for developing the right solution of complex requirements. To solve various design problems, a number of tools and techniques are available, one of them is known as design pattern, which helps to find a better solution for the problems, which are recurring in nature. Generally, the notation of design pattern is often described using UML (Unified Modeling Language), which is semi-formal in nature. The UML notation may lead to ambiguities and inconsistencies. In this study, attempts have been made to model the logics behind of structural design patterns using Web Ontology Language (OWL). For consistency checking of the OWL notation, an ontology reasoner i.e., Pellet has been considered. In order to analyze the composition of design patterns, description logic has been applied.

Each sensor node has very low battery life. Sensor nodes have finite storage capabilities, transmission and processing range and energy resources are also limited. There are many design issues in WSNs such as mobility, energy consumption, network topology, data aggregation, localization, production cost, security, network size and density etc. Routing protocols provide efficient working of the network, increase network lifetime, responsible for maintaining the routes in the network and perform reliable multi-hop communication under various conditions. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Protocol) is one of the hierarchical protocol in WSNs. LEACH uses TDMA MAC Protocol. During random data distribution, a number of TDMA slots are wasted. Because sensor nodes don't know either they have data to send or not, they continuously listen to the medium and this result in idle listening problem.

In RFID systems, reader-to-reader, tag-to-tag, reader-to-tag collisions are major challenges during object identification. The performance analysis of state-of-art protocols shows that the majority of probabilistic and deterministic algorithms are inefficient. In this work, the proposed protocol uses simulated annealing mechanism which concentrates on parameters of physical state of the RFID readers while selecting the reader for interrogation. If readers with best physical state are selected for interrogation then chances of better network performance also increases. The physical state parameters include energy efficiency, mobility, distance to tag etc. The simulation analysis of proposed scheme shows better performance with parameters like tag identification ratio, total successful interrogation cycles, total time cycles, total IDLE cycles, total number of collisions, delay, and total number of packets sent and received.

Sensor nodes in WSNare connected to each other by networks, mainly powered by a battery source. These sensor nodes have lesser amount of power and computational capabilities. Typically, sensor nodes are deployed in remote areas where replacement of their batteries once exhausted becomes extremely difficult and cumbersome. Battery power is crucial aspect of the network (while designing a protocol). To maximize the lifespan of sensor nodes we recommend a genetic algorithm-based model. In this model, energy is distributed among all the sensor nodes and network performance is enriched by choosing the cluster head and clustering on the basis of 3 important factors: a. residual energy, b. distance from the sink and c. trust of the node. The trust of the node helps to detect malicious (abnormal) nodes in the neighborhood. To further maximize the network lifetime, the proposed model implements a multihop routing mechanism for data dissemination from source to the sink. To prove the real-time effectiveness of the proposed model, we simulated it using Matlab and compared with 'Design and Implementation of a New Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm using Genetic Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks (DINEECAGA)'[11]. The algorithm was evaluated in the range of 20 to 60 sensor nodes.

It is desirable to design a protocol in WSN which reduces the energy consumption so to enhance the network lifetime. In this work, an energy efficient protocol is designed using Discrete Binary Particle Swarm Optimization which enhances the network lifetime without degrading network performance. In this work weighted sum approach is use to convert multiobjective optimization problem into a single objective optimization problem.

The traffic across junctions is controlled by signaling patterns, where the signal duration is invariably static in nature. The traffic density across either sides of the road does not affect the duration of signal. For reducing the time taken in waiting across traffic junction, the proposed work aims at simulating a dynamic traffic signal using fuzzy logic which would change the timing of the green signal with respect to the intensity of traffic and feed this to an arduino microcontroller based fuzzy inference system which decides the duration of the green signal. The intensity of traffic is computed using two methods, feature detection and image subtraction methods. The feature detection method takes lot of processing time and image subtraction method along with fuzzy logic was found more suitable in dynamically controlling the duration of traffic signals. © 2016 IEEE.","Arduino Microcontroller; Fuzzy Inference System(FIS); Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER); Speeded-Up Robust Features(SURF)","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Controllers; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Microcontrollers; Traffic signals; Feature detection; Fuzzy inference systems; Image subtraction; Maximally Stable Extremal Regions; Microcontroller-based; Speeded up robust features; Traffic densities; Traffic junctions; Traffic congestion",,"Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032570,,,"English","Proc.

Every hub itself goes about as a switch for transferring and getting packets to/from different terminals. The nodes in the network are mobile in nature and are driven by battery. If a node moves out of the radio range of the other node there are probable chances of link breakage. In the work done, a modified form of EPAR (Efficient Power Aware Routing protocol), i.e. distance efficient power aware routing protocol (D-EPAR) is used. The broadcasting process has been modified to decrease the energy consumption in the network. As energy and distance efficient path is another challenging issue to be considered, D-EPAR proposes to select energy efficient path whose distance is least from the destination. Results obtained show that the performance of D-EPAR is better and energy consumption has showed lesser values. This is primarily attributed to the modified route discovery phase where lesser number of nodes is involved in forwarding the RREQ messages. So in this manner, energy consumed by the nodes also decreases thus increasing lifetime of the network. Another network performance parameter, throughput, also increases in D-EPAR as compared to existing EPAR scheme. Thus on comparing the results of simulation it is deduced that by using D-EPAR there is an overall improvement in performance parameters of the network. © 2016 IEEE.","D-EPAR; Efficient energy; MANET; Residue battery power; RREQ","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile ad hoc networks; Power management; Routing protocols; Battery power; Efficient energy; Efficient power; Energy efficient; MANET; Performance parameters; Route discovery; RREQ; Power management (telecommunication)",,"Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032570,,,"English","Proc.

The major approaches for target localization & tracking in a defined WSN are Range Based, Range Free, Prediction Filter based Approaches aimed at achieving either Localization & Tracking accuracy or Energy Efficiency or Security or combination of these depending upon application at hand. Besides other range based techniques (TOA, TDOA, AOA) aimed at localization/tracking, RSSI-based approach is most widely used in spite of various challenges associated with it. The most important reason is that it does not need the extra hardware as most of electronic gadgets have built-in RSSI Circuitry to read RSS. By exploiting this RSSI measurement, one can find distance between transmitter & receiver using a suitable mathematical model of signal attenuation. However due to high dynamicity of wireless environment, the RSSI measurements are notoriously unpredictable. This paper discusses the RSSI based localization & tracking problem in detail & also surveys various other solutions proposed by the research community in the domain.

The primary task of WSN is to gather field data and route it to the BS for analysis. They are generally deployed in harsh localities where battery replacement is not possible advocating the need for energy efficient data gathering to elongate network lifetime. In cluster based hierarchical routing protocols (HRP's) the energy intensive task of being a cluster head are performed by a subset of deployed nodes while others are engaged in local communication. The roles of the nodes are interchanged in different rounds for load balancing. In this paper we propose an energy efficient load balanced data gathering protocol coined as RF-LEACH where partitioning is done using rough fuzzy c means (RFCM) and cluster head selection is based on fuzzy logic. Matlab simulation results indicate RF-LEACH performs better than LEACH, Fuzzy LEACH and FCM LEACH in terms of extending network lifetime and throughput in a load balanced way. The results are shown to be statistically significant. © 2016 IEEE.","FCM; Fuzzy logic; HRP; Network lifetime; Rough set; Unequal clustering","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Electric batteries; Fuzzy logic; Leaching; MATLAB; Power management (telecommunication); Rough set theory; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Battery replacements; Cluster-head selections; Data gathering protocols; Hierarchical routing protocol; Local communications; Matlab simulations; Network lifetime; Unequal clustering; Energy efficiency",,"Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032570,,,"English","Proc.

Coverage and clustering techniques enable the sensor network to operate in group-based and region-based communication and thus save the node energy. Energy-efficient protocols save the node energy and increase the network life cycle in a resource-constrained sensor network. Cluster head (CH) node manages and controls the operations such as network topology, coverage area, and routing paths (multi-paths and fault-tolerant paths) of the network. In this paper, we present deterministic K-means secure coverage clustering (K-SCC) with periodic authentication. The proposed protocol uses coverage clustering technique with periodic authentication between the CH node and sensor nodes to establish the secure channel in the network. Maximum cover of K nodes is maintained in the secure coverage cluster to achieve authenticated communication between the sensor nodes in the network. The proposed K-SCC protocol is compared with the existing protocols such as deterministic-SCC and random-SCC protocols. Simulation results indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol achieves an average of 84% coverage ratio (cluster/sensor node ratio) as compared with 62% coverage ratio in the existing SCC protocols. Simulations also indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol consumes 20% less energy as compared with the existing SCC protocol. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this design, we have taken two main parameters for analysis that is frequency (1600 MHz) and Voltage (1.05V). DDR4L operates at the lowest Voltage compared to available RAM's. Environment (LFM, Heat Sink, and Capacitance) is kept constant. For the simulation of the logic, Xilinx is used with Verilog as hardware description language.

While in coexistence, network of multiple users, competing for the same idle spectrum, ends up causing intolerable interferences to the primary receiver. Since PU is of prior importance, any kind of interruption to its transmission is not desirable. Most of the works, tries to employ the same interference management technique in both primary and secondary network. An improved interference alignment technique is proposed which can be implemented in the secondary network itself to reduce the effect of interference created at primary receiver. This will eliminate the burden of having variable filter coefficients at the primary according to the changing number of users in the secondary network. Also, by making use of the orthogonality property of interference alignment filters of SUs, SINR at each secondary receiver is maximized. Since the idle spectrum of PU is a valuable commodity and many users are competing for the same time, there arises conflict among them in taking decisions. The spectrum allocation problem is formulated under Stackelberg game framework. The equilibrium point is found through proposed game theoretic search algorithm using backward induction process and optimal strategies are obtained. The system model is implemented through the proposed block architecture in Matlab. Simulations are carried out to study the proposed system and the performances are verified under various network conditions. An improvement in performance of utility is observed for the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Game Theory; Interference Alignment; Spectrum leasing; Stackelberg game","Cognitive radio; Computation theory; MATLAB; Dynamic spectrum leasings; Interference alignment; Interference management; Interference reduction; Orthogonality properties; Spectrum allocation; Spectrum leasings; Stackelberg Games; Game theory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

However, such systems are impractical in many cases, particularly due to the complex rerouting process involved once the system turns faulty. The efficiency is reduced as the scale in circuit size increases in Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) techniques. One of the reasons is the extra hardware. The Embryonic concept has within itself a theory called Endocrine cellular communication system which is the idea behind the proposed fault tolerance system. Here, the endocrine theory is being imbibed with in the digital circuit to achieve the best possible fault tolerance. The proposed method is, in the digital circuit each working unit is surrounded by two spare units and if any one of the working unit becomes faulty, the spare unit should automatically turn active. The priority set by the system helps in choosing the spare unit to be used. The ultimate goal of this work is to overcome challenges and implement a platform model for fault tolerance techniques in digital Systems. This platform model would be used in very large-scale integrated circuits capable of self-healing and Self-replication. © 2016 IEEE.","Dual modular redundancy; embryonic; endocrine; fault tolerance; rerouting; self-healing; self-replication; spare unit; triple modular redundancy","Computation theory; Digital circuits; Fault tolerant computer systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Mobile telecommunication systems; Redundancy; Dual modular redundancy; embryonic; endocrine; rerouting; Self-healing; Self-replications; spare unit; Triple modular redundancy; Fault tolerance",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

In real time applications, the model of the systems obtained by empirical technique gives higher order model. In the proposed method, there is no need to use model order reduction technique as the higher order model can be directly used to design the sliding law. The sliding surface is (n-1)th n - order differential equation of error obtained from output and desired reference trajectory, where n is order of the system whose performance has to improve. As per the theory of sliding mode, the total control law is obtained using the proposed method by selecting sliding surface and smooth hyperbolic tangent function. The hyperbolic tangent function is used to reduce chattering phenomenon that occurs in many cases when there are use of sliding mode strategy. The single variable processes with delay time, lower or higher order, monotonic or oscillatory behavior are effectively controlled by the proposed sliding mode algorithm.

In this paper we propose energy efficient and load balanced ant colony optimization based hierarchical data gathering method (ACOHC). The deployment area is divided into optimal KOPT number of clusters using K-means. The nodes in a cluster form a chain using ant colony optimization (ACO) with the election of a chain leader (CL). The CL's forms an upper level chain using ACO with the election of a super leader (SL) to transfer the final aggregated data to the BS. Simulation results indicate that ACOHC performs better in comparison to LEACH, LEACH-C, PEGASIS and KLEACH in terms of network lifetime, energy X delay product and throughput. The statistical significance of our results is established. © 2016 IEEE.","Ant Colony Optimization; Energy X Delay Product; K-Means Clustering; Network Lifetime; Throughput; Wireless Sensor Network","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Chains; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Leaching; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Throughput; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Delay product; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical routing protocol; K-means clustering; Local communications; Network lifetime; Statistical significance; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

The proposed approach employs a new methodology for segmenting the blood vessels from the retinal images more effectively. The overall process is carried out in five steps. The first step is to pre-process the image in order to remove the presence of noise in it and to convert the color image to grey scale image. Second step is the border detection process where the of the blood vessels is are moved by a border detection algorithm. Third step is the texture features are extracted from the detected border and then these features are given as input towards the Improved Fuzzy C Means clustering (IFCM) method in order to produce the membership function. Fourth step is the defuzzification process in which the outputs of the inference obtained for each pixel is combined to a final segmented output which provides a segmented foreground against the background. Final step is the Post-processing process where the unwanted pixels are filled or removed. Our proposed algorithm is tested over 180 images in order to analyse its efficiency. From the experimental results, it has been observed that the proposed segmentation approach provides better segmentation accuracy of 97.8 % in segmenting Retinal blood vessels. © 2016 IEEE.","Improved Fuzzy-C-Means Clustering; Retinal blood vessels; Segmentation; Texture features","Computation theory; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Image processing; Image segmentation; Membership functions; Ophthalmology; Pixels; Automatic segmentations; Fuzzy C means clustering; Grey scale images; Improved fuzzy c-means clustering; Its efficiencies; Retinal blood vessels; Segmentation accuracy; Texture features; Blood vessels",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

This information is sent to base station (BS), where, it is processed and analyzed by the underlying application. Functioning of WSN highly depend on the deployment strategy and the coordination among the sensor nodes. Preserving the energy is an important goal that must be considered when developing a routing protocol for WSNs. Radio communication in sensor nodes is highly expensive operation in terms of energy usage. Energy can be conserved in an efficient way with specifically customized routing techniques. Data aggregation methods when applied to sensor nodes, clusters are created where data generated from cluster members is aggregated. This kind of data collection strategy results into energy efficient communication. Integration of data aggregation and clustering approach is enabled through customized hierarchical routing strategies. Clustering technique is key to apply and exploit, the advantages in-network data processing offers. This paper compares various clustering protocols like LEACHC, K-means and its variants. The protocols are compared with respect to network lifetime, data delivery and energy consumption. These protocols only consider intra cluster distance of members while doing clustering, due to this non-uniform clusters are created. These kind of clusters do not deliver data periodically and uniformly from every corner of the field. A density control based approach is proposed which does balancing of cluster members assignment in a loose way. A loose density control (LDC) based approach is integrated with K-means clustering method. LDC based approach exhibits improved average data delivery per node, ensuring regular data availability from every corner of the deployment area as long as the nodes are alive. Not only it improves the amount of data delivered, it also improves the network lifetime considerably. This performance improvement is achieved with almost similar energy expenditure compared to other protocols. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Clustering protocol; Clustering techniques; Controlled clustering; Data collection strategies; Energy efficient communications; Hierarchical routings; In-network data processing; K-means clustering method; Wireless sensor networks","Raval, G.; CSE Department, Institute of Technology, Nirma UniversityIndia; email: gaurang.raval@nirmauni.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",09467076,,,,"English","Microsyst Technol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973167531

Equalizing the power consumption in industry may lead to the utilization of power in other service areas in an efficient way. Although industries have comparably lesser number of power consuming device types than other service areas the power consumption is quite high. To meet the demands rising in the industry, shiftable loads (devices) can be redistributed equally to all the working time slots based on the average power utilization. It can be done in a flexible manner by shaping the loads using Demand Side Management (DSM) technique in Smart Grid. The main objective is to minimize the power utilization during the electricity rush hour by effectively distributing the power available during off-peak hour. Evolutionary algorithm can be well adapted to problems where optimization is the core criteria. Any maximization or minimization problem can be solved efficiently using evolutionary algorithm. Hence, to obtain the optimized fitness function of load redistribution in industry Genetic Algorithm in Demand Side Management (GA-DSM) is chosen and it has benefited with an overall reduction of 21.91% which is very remarkable.

The design of a suitable service selection framework helps the users in the selection of a suitable CSP, while motivating the CSPs to satisfy the assured Service Level Agreement (SLA) and enhance the Quality of Service (QoS). Existing service selection models employ random assignment of weights to the QoS attributes, replacement of missing data by random values, etc. which results in an inaccurate ranking of the CSPs. Moreover, these models have high computational overhead. In this study, a novel cloud service selection architecture, Hypergraph based Computational Model (HGCM) and Minimum Distance-Helly Property (MDHP) algorithm have been proposed for ranking the cloud service providers. Helly property of the hypergraph had been used to assign weights to the attributes and reduce the complexity of the ranking model, while arithmetic residue and Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithms were used to impute missing values.

To support anytime-anywhere seamless broadband services to all mobile subscribers, more number of macro base stations (BSs) have to be deployed. The macro BSs are power inefficient and also responsible for large carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The increase in the number of macro BSs will also increase the system cost and interference. The concept of multi-hop relay network has been widely discussed in long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) standard, where the low power relay stations (RSs) are also deployed along with the macro BS to address the coverage and capacity issues. However, improper BS and RS deployment introduces power inefficiency, transmission delay, huge deployment cost and reduced throughput. Many of the conventional deployment schemes require iterative and complex computation. These deployment schemes are not eco-friendly and do not sustain for all channel conditions. In this work, we have proposed an eco-friendly, power-aware, fuzzy based BS and RS deployment algorithm to maximize the coverage and capacity of the system. Unlike the conventional methods, a new parameter called power consumption effectiveness ratio, which accounts for the greenness of the network is proposed and included in the fuzzy based decision making process along with the coverage ratio and traffic ratio. The simulation results prove that the proposed scheme is superior over the conventional uniform clustering and fuzzy based schemes. Further the proposed scheme is more suitable candidate for power-aware green radio communication. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","BS deployment; Coverage ratio (CR); Fuzzy logic; Multi-hop relay (MHR) network; Power consumption effectiveness ratio (PCER); RS deployment; Traffic ratio (TR)","Base stations; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Computation theory; Decision making; Electric power utilization; Environmental protection; Fuzzy logic; Iterative methods; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Low power electronics; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Radio communication; Standards; Telecommunication repeaters; Complex computation; Conventional methods; Coverage ratio; Decision making process; Deployment algorithms; Multi-hop relay; Multi-hop relay networks; RS deployment; Wireless telecommunication systems","Arthi, M.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: arthimdas@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",22105379,,,,"English","Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007502869

The proposed multi-constraint, multi-objective routing optimization approach under strict resource constraints guarantees reliability and fast data delivery along with efficient power management in spite of unreliable wireless links and limited power supply. In query driven applications, the request from the sink to the individual sensor node will be a broadcast message, whereas the individual sensor nodes replies back to sink as unicast messages. In the proposed work, the fuzzy approach and “A Star” algorithm are utilized for satisfying energy and bandwidth constraints to route the broadcast messages of the sink while querying all the sensor nodes in the network. Every node will be provided with a guidance list, which is used to decide the next best neighbor node with good route quality for forwarding the received multi-hop broadcast messages. The route quality of the every node is estimated with fuzzy rules based on the network parameters such as maximum remaining energy, minimum traffic load and better link quality to increase the network lifetime. The provision of overhearing the broadcast messages and acknowledgements within the transmission range minimizes the effort to search for the active time of nodes while routing the broadcast messages with asynchronous scheduling. Further, in the proposed work only the time slot of its nearest neighbor relay node (to which packets are to be forwarded) is learnt to reduce the number of message transmissions in the network. For the unicast message replies, the fuzzy membership function is modified and devised based on the routing metrics such as higher residual energy, minimum traffic loads and minimum hop count under energy and bandwidth constraints. Also, the multi-hop heuristic routing algorithm called Nearest Neighbor Tree is effectively used to reduce the number of neighbors in the guidance list that are elected for forwarding. This helps to increase the individual sensor node's lifetime, thereby maximizes the network lifetime and guarantees increased network throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed technique reduces repeated transmissions, decreases the number of transmissions, shortens the active time of the sensor nodes and increases the network lifetime for query driven sensor network applications invariant to total the number of sensor nodes and sinks in the network. The proposed algorithm is tested in a small test bed of sensor network with ten nodes that monitors the room temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bandwidth efficient; Distributed algorithm; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetime; Multi-hop routing; Wireless sensor network","Bandwidth; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy inference; Information management; Membership functions; Network routing; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Power management; Sensor nodes; Trees (mathematics); Wireless sensor networks; Bandwidth efficient; Energy efficient; Fuzzy optimization; Maximum lifetimes; Multi-hop routing; Power management (telecommunication)","Kavi Priya, S.; Department of Information Technology, Mepco Schlenk Engineering College (Autonomous)India; email: urskavi@mepcoeng.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

Such failures can result in a disconnection in part of the network and the sensed data being unable to obtain a route to the sink(s), i.e. a network failure. Network failures potentially degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It is very difficult to monitor network failures using a manual operator in a harsh or hostile environment. In such environments, communication links can easy fail because of node unequal energy depletion and hardware failure or invasion. Thus it is desirable that deployed sensor nodes are capable of overcoming network failures. In this paper, we consider the problem of tolerating network failures seen by deployed sensor nodes in a WSN. We first propose a novel clustering algorithm for WSNs, termed Distributed Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Clustering (DEEHC) that selects cluster heads according to the residual energy of deployed sensor nodes with the aid of a secondary timer. During the clustering phase, each sensor node finds k-vertex disjoint paths to cluster heads depending on the energy level of its neighbor sensor nodes. We then present a k-Vertex Disjoint Path Routing (kVDPR) algorithm where each cluster head finds k-vertex disjoint paths to the base station and relays their aggregate data to the base station. Furthermore, we also propose a novel Route Maintenance Mechanism (RMM) that can repair k-vertex disjoint paths throughout the monitoring session. The resulting WSNs become tolerant to k-1 failures in the worst case. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested using various network scenarios and compared to the existing state of the art approaches to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2016","Fault and link failures; Network failure; Wireless sensor network","Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Electric fault currents; Energy efficiency; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Repair; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication links; Distributed routing algorithm; Environmental hazards; Hostile environments; Link failures; Network failure; State-of-the-art approach; Vertex disjoint paths; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Chanak, P.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: prasenjit.chanak@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008406292

Whenever any service is requested for updated sensor data, it must be handled through well-defined architecture, and this is governed by enterprise service bus (ESB).

Particularly 40% of total energy is consumed by indoor lights. For indoor lighting, traditionally fluorescent lamps and electronic ballasts were used. Manual approach often used for switching the lights and thereby leaving lights to remain ON even if not in use. Fluorescent light doesn't support dimming, so user needs to replace light source with different wattage to achieve different intensities. Also, they are energy inefficient. Electronic ballasts on the other hand supports dimming but are expensive. Thus, existing light system need to upgrade. Proposed system is an intelligent LED lighting control system based on fuzzy logic controller. In auto-mode, lights are switched with human presence and controls light intensity depending on available natural light. In manual mode, light intensity adjusted by using a Bluetooth enabled smartphone application. In addition, various lighting effects were added for users to create scene modes using smartphone.

The light sources considered here are mainly concerned with the LEDs having variation in their CCTs. The road lighting actually consumes a significant amount of total energy requirement of a country all through the year. But from the point of view of security of road users road lighting is extremely important. With the passage of time role of road lighting has also gradually evolved from providing safety to drivers to providing visual comfort to the road users. Now road lighting also plays a major role in increasing the pedestrian feeling of safety and creating a better ambience. Thus visually acceptable and energy efficient road lighting is desirable. The mesopic luminance region lies between photopic and scotopic. The mesopic region covers luminance between about 0.001cd/m2 to 3cd/m2. It is neither luminosity function nor luminosity function alone are representative of the eye's spectral sensitivity in the mesopic region. Still today all dimensioning is based on the photopic luminosity function, which was established in 1924. Luminosity function describes the sensitivity of the retinal cone receptors and it is applicable to daytime vision. In the mesopic range both the rods and cones on the retina are active and this is believed to cause changes in the spectral sensitivity of the eye. LEDs are said to be the future light source because of their low energy usage and efficiency. The advantages of LEDs are that they are very robust, have a very long lifetime or up to 50,000 hours, they are easily dimmable and fail by dimming over time, rather than burn off like incandescent light bulbs. LEDs cause less glare irritation because of the smaller beam angle of the luminaire. The colour of the light depends on the composition and condition of the semiconducting material used. It can be infrared, visible or ultraviolet. Blue, green and red LEDs can be used to produce most perceptible colours, including white. Today, after many years of development, the LEDs on the market are now emitting white light in different colour temperatures as well as an advanced RGB control to produce coloured light to capture different moods for various aspects. Because of the huge potential of LED technology and the constant improvements in the quality (e.g. colour rendering), it can be predicted that the use of LEDs will become more common in both indoor and outdoor lighting with the advantage of energy savings due to their efficiency and long lifetime. Another advantage of using LED is it does not contain mercury (Hg), which is not an eco-friendly chemical and has adverse effect on human body. © 2016 IEEE.","Correlated Colour Temperature; Mesopic vision; Scotopic/Photopic or S/P ratio; Spectral Luminous Efficiency Function Curve; Spectral Power Density","Color; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Incandescent lamps; Intelligent control; Light sources; Lighting; Luminance; Mercury (metal); Pedestrian safety; Power control; Roads and streets; Spectroscopy; Transportation; Incandescent light bulbs; Luminosity functions; Mesopic vision; Scotopic/Photopic or S/P ratio; Semiconducting materials; Spectral luminous efficiency; Spectral power density; Total energy requirement; Light emitting diodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

But due to the various advantages of torus network over fat tree, currently many HPC networks using fat tree are turning to the torus topology. In fat tree topology the switches have high end functionalities. Suppose a packet is traversing from the source to destination. If it has an address which is outside the range of addresses at a particular cluster head switch, then the switches at higher level with respect to the end nodes are used to route the packets to other clusters. Here checking for the destination address at all clusters is avoided, which is a great advantage of fat tree topology. On the other hand torus topology has no inheritance in the interconnection design while every node possess alike capability. This is the reason interval switching is not easy in torus network. A simple method of labeling is proposed which can be used to overcome this disadvantage of the torus topology and avail torus topology for using interval based switching. This paper shows need for labeling of nodes and four labeling schemes for the torus topology with their comparison performed with the graph theory.","Address mechanism; Fat tree; High performance computing; Labeling and graph theory; Torus","Computation theory; Graph theory; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Trees (mathematics); End-functionality; Fat trees; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); Interconnection design; Labeling scheme; Network interconnections; Torus; Topology",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032914,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The application is considered in an agro-based project and therefore, Routing protocols are mandatory to send and receive packets. In this paper, we have evaluated the most commonly used routing protocols in MANET and compared the performance of reactive routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and proactive routing protocols such as Geographic Routing Protocol (GRP), and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol by using OPNET simulator 17.5. The OPNET simulator is optimal for core level network design and parameters of sensor nodes are detailed enough to design a sensor network as the MANET in this paper. Analysis of the performance of protocols are certainly depending on End to End delay (average), Network Load and the throughput. These parameters are the common primary issues behind routing and sensor nodes in the MANET will coordinate themselves following these issues staying in an environment of proactive or reactive routing. The result shows that AODV performs better than the other two. © 2016 IEEE.","Adhoc network; AODV; Battery lifetime; DSDV; DSR; Energy-efficiency; GRP; OPNET; Wireless sensor network","Ad hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Intelligent control; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Power control; Power management (telecommunication); Routers; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Ad hoc on demand distance vector; AODV; Battery lifetime; Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector routing protocols; DSDV; Geographic routing protocols; OPNET; Pro-active routing protocols; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026388,,,"English","Int.

Due to their energy constraint issues, many routing algorithms have been developed for efficient forwarding of data for minimizing energy consumption. Considering the static sink, nodes near the sink will have more load for routing data, therefore sink has been made as mobile. Now the sink can itself moves to the sensor node or leader node for collecting data as sink can be charged with high energy. Moreover sensor nodes deployed in battlefields, hills and similar risky areas are difficult to monitor for their energy issues. So the concept of grid arises. Now the sensor network can be constructed as logical grids of uniform size and data aggregation can be done using energy efficient routing. The proposed algorithm is an enhanced form of VGDRA algorithm which is grid based routing algorithm but lacks the concept of estimating energy on the basis of distance. In the proposed algorithm, sensor network is divided into logical grids of k-cells and a Cell Header (CH) is elected among each cell that acts as leader to cluster. The algorithm proves to be efficient in terms of energy by minimizing route construction cost considering shortest distance to sink. © 2017 IEEE.","routing etc; virtual grid; Wireless sensor network","Clustering algorithms; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Low power electronics; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Construction costs; Data aggregation; Energy constraint; Energy efficient routing; Grid-based routing; Minimizing energy; routing etc; Virtual grids; Energy efficiency",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027170,,,"English","Proc.

Several techniques have been suggested for the solution of VVO problem. VVO/VVC methods are classified as analytical methods, numerical methods, heuristic approaches, and intelligent methods. Some practical VVO experiences are also reviewed. This paper presents an overview of various solution methods applied in VVO problem and future research trends in this area. © 2016 IEEE.","Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR); Distribution System; Smart Grid; Volt/VAr Control; Volt/VAr Optimization","Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Intelligent control; Numerical methods; Optimization; Power control; Power electronics; Voltage control; Conservation voltage reductions; Distribution systems; Smart grid; Volt/var control; Volt/var optimizations; Smart power grids",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These sensors are deployed to accomplish various tasks e.g. to measure the environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity, pollution level of sea water; to monitor some ongoing activities such as surveillance, tracking of suspects; and etc. Also their batteries don't last very long since it requires continues transmission of data towards the user/customer/sink. Our main goal here is how to provide simple and effective approach to provide hybrid data compression (spatial and temporal both) in the wireless sensor network in order to improve energy efficiency of the network. WSNs are deployed in great amount over the detected environment and it has been observed that the data from neighboring sensors usually have large correlation so sometimes it is waste of energy for the transmission of this duplicate information from neighboring sensors rather we can exploit this spatial correlation to reduce the heavy burden of data in transmission. Besides it has been seen that on a particular sensor, their readings are also correlated for a limited duration so we can exploit this temporal correlation to reduce the amount of data. Our scheme is not suitable to real time data monitoring rather it is quite better for delay tolerant services as it requires a little time for processing of data before transmitting it to the sink. Neighboring correlated sensors forms a cluster and their data are collectively stored in two dimensional Matrix and afterwards, Compression techniques are applied in both domain (Space and Time). That's why it is termed as Hybrid Compression. After applying these compression methods the data are transmitted towards the sink. Our result shows that our proposed scheme gives satisfactory approximation of received data at the sink. © 2016 IEEE.","Auto Regressive Moving Average; Principal Component Analysis; Wireless Sensor Network","Data compression; Data handling; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Principal component analysis; Seawater; Water pollution; Autoregressive moving average; Compression techniques; Effective approaches; Energy efficient wireless sensor networks; Environmental attributes; Real-time data monitoring; Temporal correlations; Transmission of data; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Solar and wind power system controlled by WSN technologies has been also installed to meet the excess load demands.

The main aim of anomaly detection is to identify all the data points with significant deviation from other normal data points. Mining the outliers become more challenging in environments where data is received at extreme pace. Such environments demand detection of outliers on-the-fly mode. The existing anomaly detection methods focus more towards the identification of point anomalies, very few of them explore the problem of collective anomaly detection over data streams. In this paper, we present a mutual density based anomaly detection algorithm, which can identify collective anomalies in data streams.

This reduces the length of the multi-hop flow setup in the data window. In a multi-hop scenario, this degrades both the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD).

In human as well as in biped humanoids the periodic walking pattern which is known as gait, consists of both discrete (known as stance phase) and continuous phases (known as swing phase). The system is highly nonlinear and modelling using conventional kinematics has not proved to be very effective. Several compelling assumptions to make model simple makes it unrealistic. In this research work we present a computational model for prediction, formal verification and analyses of joint trajectories of bipedal locomotion using powerful theoretical computer science framework which is known as automata theory-more precisely here hybrid automata technique has been used for modelling. We argued that hybrid automata is more suitable to model a biped locomotion which is inherently hybrid (consisting of discrete and continuous phases) in nature. One of the major contributions of the paper is developing the hybrid automata model for automatic generation of joint trajectories for different sub phases of a bipedal gait. Other contributions include the development of generic equations for seven sub interval phases of a gait cycle which has been divided into eight equal parts and verification of its correctness by comparing the model with one existing standard model of OpenSim named as GAIT-2354 [1]. Through rigorous simulations we have established that the hip and knee joint trajectories generated by our hybrid automata based model closely matches with OpenSim model and that of captured data driven model of normal walking. Hence it is effective, robust and generic. We conclude that since the hybrid automata based model has a strong theoretical basis, it can be used for generating hip and knee trajectories for any biped robot for subsequent execution level control. © 2016 IEEE.","Bipedal Gait; Double Support phase (DSP); Hybrid Automata; Non linear dynamics; Single Support phase (SSP); Vector Field","Automata theory; Computation theory; Formal verification; Gait analysis; Joints (anatomy); Trajectories; Bipedal gait; Double support phase; Hybrid automatons; Non-linear dynamics; Single-support phase; Vector fields; Biped locomotion",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509025961,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015357633

WSN deployment is constrained with sensor node's energy, communication range, limited on-board resources etc. Optimization of the energy consumption over the network to improve network lifetime is a challenging problem. Compressed Sensing (CS) involvement in WSN brought a solution to energy efficient data aggregation. This article presents a method, which exploits compressed sensing and dictionary learning to achieve energy efficiency in the scenario of data aggregation in WSN, where sensor node measures different sensors data. We demonstrate performance analysis of multiple sensors method with metrics, probability of successful recovery and network transmission cost. Extensive simulations on practical data set shows that our data aggregation method for practical scenario can deliver data to sink with minimum transmission cost which inherently saves significant energy to prolong the network lifetime. The probability of successful recovery shows that our method can recover compressed data with maximum probability. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Compressed sensing; Computer system recovery; Constrained optimization; Cost benefit analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Light transmission; Probability; Recovery; Sensor nodes; Signal reconstruction; Wireless sensor networks; Communication range; Compressive sensing; Dictionary learning; Extensive simulations; Internet of Things (IOT); Maximum probability; Network transmission; Performance analysis; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041305,,,"English","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015199296

In these applications, in order to offer quality services for MANETs, many routing protocols have been designed. In this paper, a novel method that detects and prevents the supportive black hole attack on MANETs is developed. The proposed method is based on adaptive fuzzy inference system for MANET in order to detect and prevent the cooperative black hole attack. The popular protocol utilized in MANET is on-demand distance vector (AODV) protocol, and is simulated using NS2. The simulated results of the proposed method are compared with that of an adaptive method [17], wherein source node checks all nodes activity by using DAT table that maintains from-node-to-next-node's information and declares black hole node by channel overhearing method.

Usually such areas are unreachable rendering battery change of sensor nodes infeasible. So data gathering protocols should be energy efficient to elongate WSN lifetime. We propose a data gathering method coined as FCM-DS-ACO which uses fuzzy c means (FCM) to cluster the sensor nodes. The dominating set (DS) for each cluster is found out and ant colony optimization (ACO) is used to form cluster chains out of the DS. Chain leader (CL) for each cluster chain is selected based on its residual energy and proximity to base station (BS). Data is aggregated as it moves along the cluster chain to CL which transmits it directly to BS.

However, we see that power and energy are both critical concerns in High performance computing applications. One of the biggest challenges in HPC is power efficiency. Power and energy consumption has to be minimized to reduce the cost without much change in the performance of the application. One basic requirement to achieve this power efficiency is to measure the power consumption of application runs. If we cannot identify the power profile of an application, improvising the power utilization becomes more challenging. Although, external electronic watt meters exist to perform the analysis, software techniques to detect the power usage have been found to be more convenient for dynamic runs of the application. Also, the use of external hardware implies extra costs. Additionally, power has to be supplied to the device for its operation. Previous efforts to develop such a system have involved the use of expensive and bulky hardware technology and software applications that are not very accurate. We propose a software tool named PHOENIX that measures the power consumption and identifies the power profiles of the applications. The results are validated using a hardware power meter. We use rodinia benchmark suite to verify our results. Our results show that we achieve an average of 88% accuracy when compared to hardware power meter. © 2016 IEEE.","High Performance Computing; Power efficiency; Power profiling","Computer software; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); High-performance computing applications; Power and energy consumption; Power efficiency; Power profiling; Software applications; Software techniques; Application programs","Ahmed, M.; HKBK College of Engineering, VTUIndia; email: mz.maaz@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509019861,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In this paper, we evaluate the importance of QoS in the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for WSNs using different metrics and parameters such as energy efficiency, throughput, delay, and the network lifespan. We propose a new QoS MAC protocol, “PRIority in Node” (PRIN), using static priority in the source and the intermediate node and priority among the node which is one hop from the sink node to achieve QoS in WSNs.

Since the communicating nodes in AOMDV are prone to link failures and route breaks due to the selection of multiple routes between any source and destination pair based on minimal hop count which does not ensure end-to-end reliable data transmission. To overcome such problems, we propose a novel node disjoint multipath routing protocol called End-to-End Link Reliable Energy Efficient Multipath Routing (E2E-LREEMR) protocol by extending AOMDV. The E2E-LREEMR finds multiple link reliable energy efficient paths between any source and destination pair for data transmission using two metrics such as Path-Link Quality Estimator and Path-Node Energy Estimator. We evaluate the performance of E2E-LREEMR protocol using NS 2.34 with varying network flows under random way-point mobility model and compare it with AOMDV routing protocol in terms of Quality of Service metrics. When there is a hike in network flows, the E2E-LREEMR reduces 30.43 % of average end-to-end delay, 29.44 % of routing overhead, 32.65 % of packet loss ratio, 18.79 % of normalized routing overhead and 12.87 % of energy consumption.

However, in a two-tiered cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving data from their member sensor nodes, aggregating them and transmitting that data to the base station (BS). Therefore, proper selection of CHs and optimal formation of clusters play a crucial role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient CH selection and energy balanced cluster formation algorithms, which are based on novel chemical reaction optimization technique (nCRO), we jointly called these algorithms as novel CRO based energy efficient clustering algorithms (nCRO-ECA). These algorithms are developed with efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and potential energy functions. For the energy efficiency, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes in the CH selection phase. In the cluster formation phase, we consider various distance and energy parameters. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs by varying number of sensor nodes and CHs.

However, security and privacy challenges arrive as client–server communication is done via public network. To lower down the security and privacy threats, authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols are being designed and analyzed. AKA protocols’ goal is to ensure authorized and secure access of recourses. Recently, Li et al. proposed a biometric based three-factor remote user authentication scheme for client–server environment. Their scheme uses biometric identifier to resist guessing attacks. In this article, we discussed the security of Li et al.'s scheme, and show its vulnerability to known session specific temporary information attack.

However, newly developed soft computing based techniques can provide solution. In order to have advantages of conventional and heuristic soft computing based control techniques, in this paper various commonly used intelligent techniques, neural network, fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been combined with sliding mode controller (SMC). For validation, proposed hybrid control schemes have been implemented for tracking a predefined trajectory by robotic manipulator, incorporating structured and unstructured uncertainties in the system. After reviewing numerous papers, all the commonly occurring uncertainties like continuous disturbance, uniform random white noise, static friction like coulomb friction and viscous friction, dynamic friction like Dhal friction and LuGre friction have been inserted in the system. Various performance indices like norm of tracking error, chattering in control input, norm of input torque, disturbance rejection, chattering rejection have been used.

In our previous work,”Priority based slot allocation for media access in wireless sensor networks” (PSAWSN), probability based priority scheme is used to allocate slots to competing nodes. Limitations of this work include 1) It does not handle dynamic and variable slot allocation based on varying requirements of nodes. 2) Error control is not taken into account. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Medium Access Control scheme using Priority Index (MACPI) that generates Priority Index (PI) to allocate varying slots based on parameters: message length (ML), node energy (NE), number of requests (NR) and message urgency (MU). Models have been de- signed for all these parameters and an expert system is proposed that makes decisions based on collective knowledge of these parameters. Analysis and simulation results for various message sizes and error conditions show that there is an improvement in terms of energy efficiency, optimal message length and throughput compared to the”Reliable data deliveries using packet optimization in multi-hop underwater sensor networks”(RDPSN). © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

MANETs do not use any centralized administration for communication. The performance of a MANET can be further enhanced by adapting a cluster mechanism with the help of CEAACK to provide security from penetrators. In this paper we propose a new improved ant colony optimization algorithm with two strategies to reduce the overhead in communication by predicting mobility of node and cluster formation. Firstly, a dynamic mechanism is designed for determining one or more heuristic parameters for improving the performance of the MANET. Secondly a dynamic list of nodes are maintained which helps in forming clusters and electing the cluster head faster. In addition a dynamic broadcast approach algorithm is incorporated to provide the information about the status of the nodes to the hybrid fuzzy-ant colony algorithm. This approach ensures low maintenance cost and is expected to be robust against node failures and network topology changes. The positive outcome of these two techniques consumes low energy and in the process provides better efficiency in data transmission in MANETs. It also achieves correct delivery of packets without unnecessary delay. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Base station; Cluster; Clustered enhanced adaptive acknowledgment (CEAACK); Dynamic broadcast; Fuzzy logic; Improved ant colony; Mobile ad hoc NETwork (MANET); Mobility prediction","Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Telecommunication networks; Ant colonies; Cluster; Clustered enhanced adaptive acknowledgment (CEAACK); Dynamic broadcasts; Mobility predictions; Mobile ad hoc networks","Ramakrishnan, B.; Department of Computer Science and Research Centre, S.T.

The considered IHPS model is comprised of a wind turbine generator, a diesel engine generator and an energy storage device (such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), in this case). Traditionally, SF, membership functions and control rules are obtained in fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) by trial and error method or are obtained based on the experiences of the designers or are optimized by some traditional optimization techniques with some extra computational cost. To overcome all these problems of FLCs, classical controllers have been integrated in this paper with the FLC. QOHS algorithm is applied to simultaneously tune the SFs (the only tunable parameter of FLC), the gains of the classical controllers and the tunable parameters of the SMES device to minimize frequency and power deviations of the studied IHPS system against various load demand and wind change. Different considered controller configurations of the IHPS are SF based FLC (termed as Fuzzy-only), SF based FLC with proportional-integral (PI) (named as Fuzzy-PI) controller, SF based FLC with proportional-derivative (PD) (abbreviated as Fuzzy-PD) controller and SF based FLC with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) (designated as Fuzzy-PID) controller. Simulation results, explicitly, show that the performance of the Fuzzy-PID controller based IHPS is superior to Fuzzy-only, Fuzzy-PI and Fuzzy-PD controller based IHPS configuration in terms of overshoot, settling time and the proposed Fuzzy-PID controller is robust against various wide range of load changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Classical controllers; Frequency; Fuzzy logic controller; Harmony search; Power; Quasi-opposition","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Diesel engines; Electric control equipment; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric power system control; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Identification (control systems); Magnetic storage; Membership functions; Optimization; Power control; Proportional control systems; Superconducting magnets; Three term control systems; Traffic signals; Turbogenerators; Two term control systems; Water craft; Wind turbines; Classical controllers; Frequency; Fuzzy logic controllers; Harmony search; Power; Quasi-opposition; Controllers","Ganguly, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Bankura Unnayani Instute of EngineeringIndia; email: somnath_aec82@yahoo.co.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",22106502,,,,"English","Swarm Evol.

In MLR WDM networks, channels are structured as sub-bands, each of which consists of wavelengths operating at a similar data rate. By reducing the (1) spacing within a sub-band, or (2) spacing between sub-bands operating at different data rates, spectral efficiency can be improved. However, owing to high physical layer impairment levels, decrease in sub-band spacing adversely affects transmission reach of the channels, which results in higher power consumption due to requirement of increased signal regeneration. In this work, we compare power efficiency of various MLR and single-line-rate (SLR) solutions, and also investigate the trade-off that exists between spectral and power efficiency in a WDM network. Simulation results indicate that (1) for high transmission capacities, a combination of 100 Gbps transponders and 40 Gbps regenerators will obtain the highest power efficiency; (2) for long connection distances, a point ofmerging occurs for various SLR and MLR designs, where power consumption is independent of the frequency band distribution; and (3) for MLR systems, both spectral and power efficiency can be improved by using either shorter links with higher bandwidth assignment to 100 Gbps wavelengths, or longer links with higher bandwidth assignment to 40 Gbps wavelengths. Finally, the results indicate that focusing on spectral efficiency alone results in extra power consumption, since high quality of transmission and spectral efficiency leads to increased regeneration. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Mixed-line rate; Power efficiency; Quality of transmission; Single-line rate; Spectral efficiency; Sub-band spacing","Bandwidth; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Electric power utilization; Frequency bands; Multiplexing; Network layers; Wavelength division multiplexing; Line rate; Mixed line rates; Power efficiency; Quality of Transmission; Spectral efficiencies; Subbands; Energy efficiency","Iyer, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Christ University Faculty of Engineering, Mysore Road, India; email: sridhariyer1983@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",1387974X,,,,"English","Photonic Netw.

This paper proposes a method called, Moving Average-based Fuzzy Resource Scheduling (MV-FRS) for virtualized cloud environment to optimize the scheduling of resources through virtual machines. Initially, the MV-FRS method starts by predicting the resource (i.e. bandwidth, memory and processing cycle) requirements. Then a measure of relationships between availability of resources and the requirements of resources are made. Finally, a fuzzy control theory is designed to accomplish system accessibility between user cloud requirements and cloud users resources availability. The simulations results demonstrate that the MV-FRS method is able to reduce the total waiting time of cloud user resource requirements and also ensure the feasibility and effectiveness of the overall system accessibility in terms of average success rate and resource usage when running in a cloud computing environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Data center; Max Min Fuzzy; Resource scheduling; Virtual machine","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Fuzzy control; Java programming language; Quality of service; Scheduling; Transportation; Cloud computing environments; Data centers; Max-min; Resource management; Resource requirements; Resource-scheduling; System maintenance; Virtual machines; Distributed computer systems","Priya, V.; Department of Information Technology, K.S Rangasamy College of Technology, Namakkal, India; email: priya.saravanaraja@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09205489,,CSTIE,,"English","Comput Stand Interfaces",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995467083

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used in MANETs to monitor activities to detect any intrusion in the otherwise vulnerable network. In this paper, we present efficient schemes for analyzing and optimizing the time duration for which the IDSs need to remain active in aMANET. A probabilistic model is proposed, which makes use of cooperation between IDSs among neighborhood nodes to reduce their individual active time. Typically, an IDS has to run all the time on every node to oversee network behavior. This can turn out to be a costly overhead for a battery-powered mobile device in terms of power and computational resources. Hence, in this work, our aim is to reduce the duration of active time of the IDSs without compromising their effectiveness. To validate our proposed approach, we model the interactions between IDSs as a multiplayer cooperative game in which the players have partially cooperative and partially conflicting goals.We theoretically analyze this game and support it with simulation results. © 2016 IEEE.","Ad hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Intrusion detection","Ad hoc networks; Computer crime; Energy efficiency; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Mobile devices; Network security; Wireless ad hoc networks; Computational resources; Dynamic wireless networks; Efficient schemes; Infrastructureless; Intrusion Detection Systems; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Network behaviors; Probabilistic modeling; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189545,,ITVTA,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The EE optimization problem is formulated as the ratio of the spectrum efficiency (SE) over the entire power consumption of the network subject to total transmit power, subcarrier pairing, and allocation constraints. The formulated problem is a nonconvex fractional mixed binary integer programming problem, i.e., NP-hard to solve. Furthermore, we resolve the convexity of the problem by a series of convex transformations and propose an iterative EE maximization algorithm to jointly determine the optimal subcarrier pairing at the relay, subcarrier allocation to each user pair and power allocation to all source and the relay nodes. Additionally, we derive an asymptotically optimal solution by using the dual decomposition method. To gain more insights into the obtained solutions, we further analyze the resource allocation algorithm in a two-user case with interference-dominated and noise-dominated regimes. In addition, a suboptimal algorithm is investigated with reduced complexity at the cost of acceptable performance degradation.

In particular, we consider the problem of maximizing the lifetime of coverage of targets in a wireless sensor network with battery-limited sensors. We first show that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor less than \ln n by any polynomial time algorithm, where n is the number of targets. This provides closure to the long-standing open problem of showing optimality of previously known \ln n approximation algorithms. We also derive a new \ln n approximation to the problem by showing the \ln n approximation to the related maximum disjoint set cover problem. We show that this approach has many advantages over algorithms in the literature, including a simple and optimal extension that solves the problem with multiple coverage constraints. For the 1-D network topology, where sensors can monitor contiguous line segments of possibly different lengths, we show that the optimal coverage lifetime can be found in polynomial time. Finally, for the 2-D topology in which coverage regions are unit squares, we combine the existing results to derive a 1+\epsilon approximation algorithm for the problem. Extensive simulation experiments validate our theoretical results, showing that our algorithms not only have optimal worst case guarantees but also match the performance of the existing algorithms on special network topologies.

In such large systems, energy aware scheduling using only low level power constructs like DVFS technique may not be suitable and thus designing energy efficient scheduling techniques becomes essential which use power constructs at a higher granularity. In this paper, we have derived a simple power model designed at a higher granularity for such large systems having multi-threaded processors.

Reversible sequential circuits are going to be very demanding unit to design memory block of various computing engine for its extreme less power expenditure. In this work, primary focus is to optimize circuit area, garbage output, and delay to introduce testable feature in the reversible sequential circuit, implemented in classical gates. Sequential circuit can be trailed for stuck-at faults which are classical unidirectional without increasing the circuit area. By this methodology without changing the circuit design, testable feature is easily introduced at reversible latch. Introducing testable feature in existing reversible sequential circuit without increasing the cost metric and without changing the circuit design is propounded first time in article. Moreover, proposed methodology can be applied to any reversible or irreversible latch based on conservative logic block to make the latch testable for unidirectional stuck-at fault. Synthesis of efficient reversible logic is key ponderosity in robustly testable design of molecular QCA based logic circuits. And the molecular QCA based circuit will be more robust if it is built with multilayer approach. Thus, D latch is implemented in triple molecular quantum dot cellular automata to make it more robust and testable using proposed methodology without increasing area of the circuit to make better cost effective system.

Manpower working in industries is mostly semi-skilled. Production output, its quality and cost are affected by energy wastage and device failure causing downtimes resulting from electrical faults and erroneuos operations. Such abnormality must be detected and reported proactively to the facility manager, who can act to avoid major losses. This paper describes the concept of detecting electrical and operational abnormality (anomaly) of loads through observing changes in electrical parameters collected by installation of energy meters. The paper proposes classification of anomalies based on their origin. Further, essential feature sets required for accurate detection of anomalies are described. To verify the concept, load data is collected from a pilot small scale manufacturing facility by installing energy meters at different load points in process lines. After preprocessing the raw data, necessary features are extracted and are subjected to classification algorithms for detecting possible anomalies. Results for two loads at test site are presented with comparison of support vector data descriptor and support vector machine algorithms for classification as normal or anomalous. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Electric measuring instruments; Energy efficiency; Feature extraction; Flowmeters; Manufacture; Classification algorithm; Electrical parameter; Energy-intensive manufacturing industries; Manufacturing facility; Manufacturing sector; Production outputs; Support vector data; Support vector machine algorithm; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Massive multi input multi output (MIMO) techniques are the driving force behind green communications, since they provide better energy efficiency with reduced transmit power. The massive data generated from such mobile communication systems, is a rich data source of great value. Procuring useful analytics from this precious resource, a big data aware 5G mobile communication system can be developed. A particular choice of big analytics brings in the concept of large random matrix models and single ring law. In this paper, first, big data analytics is performed in the context of a mobile user communicating to, either a massive MIMO or a massive MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Constructive insights such as transmitted (source) signal correlation analysis (attributed to certain network events), channel correlation analysis (attributed to user mobility) have been extracted. Ring law also has its roots in signal detection, which suggests that few other signal detection algorithms may be suitable candidates for signal/channel correlation analysis. Therefore, second, a proposed extension of an information theoretic criterion (ITC) based signal detection algorithm, for correlation analysis, is compared with ring law. Using massive MIMO and MIMO-OFDM system simulations, the said correlation analyses have confirmed the prevalence of ring law. Third, it is deduced that integrating big data analytics with massive MIMO system improves spectral efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.",,"5G mobile communication systems; Correlation detectors; Correlation methods; Energy efficiency; Frequency division multiplexing; Information theory; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio broadcasting; Signal detection; Green communications; Information theoretic criterion; Large random matrices; MIMO-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing; Multi input multi output; Signal correlation analysis; Signal detection algorithm; Spectral efficiencies; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

To deliver a high QoS for users, an eNodeB requires a well-designed and efficient CA enabled downlink scheduling algorithm. Enabling aggregation of multiple component carriers leads to huge power consumption compared with non-CA scenario. To the best of our knowledge, CA enabled downlink scheduling mechanisms which have been proposed so far in the literature has not addressed simultaneously the QoS, carrier's power allocation and Physical Resource Block (PRB) utilization while taking scheduling decisions.

It involves the issues related to energy and dynamic spectrum inherited by WSN and cognitive radio network (CRN) respectively. CRSN poses research challenges in designing an efficient topology control for communication in network. In this paper, we propose an event-driven cluster based routing approach for CRSN that jointly considers both the energy and dynamic spectrum challenges. Reported schemes for CRSN suffer from high frequency of re-clustering due to PU activities and are energy inefficient. The proposed scheme employs a self-organized distributed clustering to obtain less average node power by producing the optimal number of clusters. To mitigate the effect of PUs' activities, our proposed scheme forms clusters having more number of common channels. To enhance inter-cluster connectivity, our proposed scheme selects gateway nodes having more number of common channels with neighboring nodes. Furthermore, a cluster-head (CH) rotation mechanism is employed that picks the CH based on nodes' residual energy values, available channels, neighbors and distance to the sink in order to have longer network lifetime. Upon detection of an event, the proposed scheme aims to route the event samples through an energy efficient and stable path from source node to the sink node.

In this paper we propose an energy-saving video compression technique for WMSN with a newly proposed differential inter frame partial discrete wavelet technique. Considering the application domain where video frames from an array of video sensors are co-related we exploit this inter frame co-relation by taking the partial wavelet transform between the frames followed by identifying the difference of wavelet of these frames. The scheme works in accordance with a tree based routing scheme for randomly placed node with an aim to reduce energy consumption further. The evaluation of the proposed scheme is performed through simulation and statistical analysis on the simulation results. The efficiency of the scheme is measured in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Simulation results confirm our scheme's supremacy over the competing schemes in terms of energy while maintaining an acceptable reconstruction quality. © 2016 IEEE.","Compression; Differential inter frame partial discrete wavelet transform; Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network","Compaction; Digital storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Multimedia systems; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; Wireless sensor networks; Compression techniques; Inter-frame; Peak signal to noise ratio; Reconstruction quality; Reduce energy consumption; Tree-based routing; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN); Image compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

We present a physical design flow that integrates thermal driven floor-planning with MOEA. The thermal aware floor-planning help reduce the magnitude of hotspots in each layer, in turn, alleviate the negative impact of heat dissipation on chip performance and reliability. The essence of the flow is to analyze the layered thermal map of the chip stack and then apply MOEA operators, which helps to put the power hungry functional units far from each other.3D stacked heterogeneous mesh architecture with 3 layers is used as the baseline for our experimental work. Further another two layers has been added to check the impact of increasing number of layers on the peak temperature of individual layers. The experimental results show the suitability of our algorithm for significantly reducing maximum on-chip temperature.

These demands can be fulfilled by one of the most popular networks of its type—vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs). As vehicles in VANETs are constrained with respect to the available resources such as computation and storage, lot of energy is consumed to perform a number of complex operations, which may lead to the emission of harmful CO2 emission that effect the global warming system. Moreover, because of high velocity led by constant topological changes, it is a challenging task to maintain quality of service with respect to parameters such as high throughput, and minimum end-to-end delay. Hence, an intelligent approach is required to optimize the various complex operations in this environment, which may led to the minimum emission of CO2 and other gasses. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient energy-aware predictive clustering scheme for vehicles. Efficient algorithms are designed for future mobility predictions and average variations of vehicles on the road. The algorithms estimate the clustering duration and total vehicles in the cluster. The performance of the designed algorithms is studied using extensive simulations by varying the number of vehicles and cluster durations in comparison with existing benchmarked scheme in the literature. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is superior in comparison with the existing scheme of its category. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

The purpose of this project is to implement a delay based Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) device on FPGA and test its performance. The implementation of the PUF logic is done using combinatorial logic. Here in this project, we implemented two types of delay PUFs those are Arbiter PUF and Ring Oscillator PUF. Delay based PUF exploit inherent delay characteristics of transistors and wires that varies from chip to chip. We described how PUF can be used for low-cost authentication of IC's.

To rectify this difficulty those multipliers are replaced with Vedic multiplier. The Vedic multiplier with AHL circuit helps to increase the performance of the multiplier. Vedic multiplication reduces computation time by Urdhva - tiryakbhyam sutra of Vedic mathematics. Vedic multiplier is efficient in silicon area per speed. It occupies less area because of its reduced number of logic blocks. But in this multiplier the power is dissipated in both active and standby modes. MTCMOS is used to overcome this problem. Multi-threshold technology is a noteworthy technique to reduce leakage power. MTCMOS logic is effective in standby leakage control technique, which is used to adjust the threshold voltage of the circuit.

A typical neuron can be divided into functionally three distinct parts called Dendrites, Soma and Axon. Dendrites play the role of input device that collect signals from other neurons and transmits them to soma. Soma performs a Non-linear operation, i.e. if input exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is generated. This output signal is taken over by an output device, the Axon, which delivers the signal to other neurons. This is the basic function of a biological neuron. A biological neuron model which is also known as Spiking Neuron Model is a mathematical description of properties of neuron that is to be designed accurately to describe and predict the biological processes. So there comes the concept of modelling and analysis of neurons. Modelling and analysis of neurons was performed by different researchers on First, Second and Third generation of neurons. The Third generation of neurons are also called as spiking neurons. The focus of this work is to implement different types of spiking neuron models developed by Izhikevich which is a mathematical model and Hodgkin and Huxley which is a biological model. Comparison between these two models in terms of Design implementation has been done.

When building wireless sensor networks network there is critical issues are emerged such as preserving energy and load balancing. Lifetime of a sensor network is enhanced by implementing and mitigating energy consumption. Number of various parameters such as number of nodes, strength and range of area as well as connectivity of nodes in the network are responsible for the lifetime of network. Energy of battery is most important things for sensor nodes in wireless sensor network. Efficient energy is major part of in mitigate the overhead as well as limited transmission and aggregating data is also important for the enhancing network lifetime. We proposed a clustering routing protocol CRT2FLACO on the basis of type-2 fuzzy logic as well as ACO for balancing the network load and to enhance the lifetime of WSN. Our proposed protocol determines the three fundamental parts of residual energy, neighbor nodes as well as the distance to base station as inputs of a type-2 Mamdani FLS and after that calculate the possibility of a node upgrading as a candidate cluster head and the cluster head competition radius. Implementation of type-2 fuzzy logic is better way to control the overhead existing in WSN. Load of network is efficiently handled by fuzzy unequal competition radius as well as implementation of multi-hop routing protocol technique for data transmission. Additionally, security of data is determined by utilizing encryption algorithm in transmission of data.

Detecting and removing interferences in the analysis phase of software development will improve the design reflected by the desirable execution of software. This paper provides a new methodology to detect and resolve the interference in during analysis phase of Aspect oriented software development.

An existing AO analysis method namely, Theme approach is used to identify the base and the cross-cutting themes from the given set of requirements. The EAOIA tool identifies the existence of two types of interference by analyzing the intermediate code generated from the requirements. The cause and type of the interferences are identified and solution for its removal is suggested to the user. The user can then apply and verify the removal of identified interferences.

However, scaling also impairs fault, noise and reliability issues, thus pretense new challenges in digital circuit design and system. Reliability becomes a foremost concern due to many and often correlated factors, such constraints and/or engineering deviations, aging and soft errors. A Defect and/or fault tolerance may be necessary at several levels throughout the system to improve the reliability of the system. Generally a fault tolerance technique is used to improve the reliability. Quadded logic (QL) is an interwoven redundant logic technique while Quadded Transistor (QT) corrects errors while performing the function of a circuit. The proposed Quadded logic Quadded transistor (QLQT) technique with multi voltage logic to reduce the power consumption and design half adder using this technique. To implement this technique in multiple identical core, TMR is introduced that allows the core to be efficiently tested. A scan chain based technique is employed to recover multiple errors in Triple modular redundancy (TMR) systems. This technique makes use of the scan chain flip-flops that are employed to recover the correct state of a Triple Modular Redundancy system in the presence of temporary or permanent errors. This technique can detect both permanent faults and transient faults. Also a fault tolerant voter identifies multiple faults. The proposed technique improves reliability and reduce the fault. The proposed method is simulated by using Xilinx simulator. © 2016 IEEE.","Quadded logic; Quadded Transistor; Triple modular redundancy","Chains; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Errors; Fault tolerant computer systems; Flip flop circuits; Integrated circuit manufacture; Integrated circuit testing; Radiation hardening; Redundancy; Reliability; Digital circuit design; Fault tolerance techniques; Fault tolerant voter; Permanent faults; Quadded Logic; Quantitative measures; Satellite applications; Triple modular redundancy; Fault tolerance",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

With increase in integration of transistors, the power budget is no longer balanced while moving from one technology node to another. Because of this the power density is no longer constant and it is now increasing with technology scaling. In successive generations the percentage of chip that can be switched at full frequency is dropping exponentially. This problem of Dark Silicon [1] is forcing the designers to power on only a few on-chip resources [2] at a time in order to avoid hitting the maximum power utilization mark. If we keep neglecting the Power density issue it is said that the microprocessors will soon have power density comparable to that of the sun at around 10,000W/cm2. Heterogeneous computing [3] is one of the proposed solutions to effectively tackle the power problem with increasing number of transistors. It has been crucial in increasing the performance and energy efficiency. A Heterogeneous Architecture has the potential to match each application to the best suited core. In Heterogeneous Architectures, each application can be matched to the best suited core in order to efficiently run the application. This solves the problem where most applications under utilize the hardware and there is very little performance drop when the same application is run on a less powerful processor. Dark Silicon also opens up new possibilities for integrating Hardware Accelerators which can be scheduled dynamically or statically. In Heterogeneous systems, the large number of exchanges between cores also contribute to the increase in power consumption. The interconnects also play an important role in energy efficiency. This paper focuses on identifying and highlighting some of the critical challenges faced due to Dark Silicon. The paper also lists down some initial research efforts to tackle these issues. © 2016 IEEE.","Dark Silicon; Heterogeneous Cores; Multi-core Processors; Thermal Design Power","Budget control; Computer architecture; Electric power utilization; Hardware; Information systems; Nanoelectronics; Silicon; Dark silicons; Hardware accelerators; Heterogeneous architectures; Heterogeneous computing; Heterogeneous cores; Heterogeneous systems; Multi-core processor; Thermal designs; Energy efficiency",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061693,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The faults coercively put the networks into miscellaneous system level failures like packet corruption, misrouting, and dropping. Thus, the reliability has become a special interest. Additionally, the performance of the NoCs is somewhat deviated. This paper proposes a distributed and time-efficient on-line test model that addresses stuck-at faults in interswitch and local channels of NoCs as well as analyze the effect of the faults on various performance metrics. Fault simulations achieve 100% coverage metrics and show that the proposed test model takes same test clocks to detect the faults in larger NoCs. Further, online evaluation of the proposed test model reveals that it speeds more than 16 times up on a set of NoCs. Simultaneously, we observe packet latency is improved to 20.17-44.45% while energy consumption by a packet flit is reduced to 16.96-39.40% on these NoCs.

As compared with wired networks, the rate of random packet loss due to wireless channel errors or node mobility is very high in MANET. Misinterpretation of random packet loss as loss due to congestion by TCP causes significant degradation in the performance (i.e. aggregate throughput) of the network. Numerous solutions are proposed in literature, but they either are cross layer solution or focused on specific issues of TCP. In this paper, we present a new energy efficient, end-to-end, layered solution named as 'Proposed-TCP', as transport layer protocol. The 'Proposed-TCP' can identify packet loss due to congestion, wireless channel error and route failure, by using multiple end-to-end metrics and handles incipient congestion in the network also. The 'Proposed-TCP' is implemented and simulated in Network Simulator (NS2).

Recently there are various claims of hypercomputation and this work examines two of the most celebrated of them in detail. Although Turing machines are believed to be the ultimate model of computation, but the claims of hypercomputation are challenging this notion with great confidence. There are various hypercomputation models based on various theories. Hypercomputation models based on neural networks have developed in recent years, claiming to go beyond the limits set by the Church-Turing thesis. The Church-Turing thesis is the assertion that no machine can compute more than a Turing machine. In this work we will prove that the models considered are not computing the uncomputable and hence, not breaking the Turing barrier. In essence the models cross the Turing limit if and only if they are supplemented with a hypercomputer in advance otherwise they are equivalent to the Turing machine model. The arguments presented in this paper are of prime importance as they are directly applicable to judge other claims of hypercomputation too.","Computability theory; Hypercomputation; Models of computation; Neural hypercomputation; Sanskrit; Turing machine with advice; Turing machines","Computability and decidability; Computation theory; Machinery; Church-Turing thesis; Computability theory; Hypercomputation; Model of computation; Models of computation; Sanskrit; Turing barriers; Turing machines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

Modern power aware systems utilize the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling mechanism available in processors to manage the energy consumption. In this paper, we initially characterize the energy efficiency of MapReduce jobs with respect to built-in power governors. Our analysis indicates that while a built-in power governor provides the best energy efficiency for a job that is CPU as well as IO intensive, a common CPU-frequency across the cluster provides best the energy efficiency for other types of jobs. In order to identify this optimal frequency setting, we derive energy and performance models for MapReduce jobs on a HPC cluster and validate these models experimentally on different platforms. We demonstrate how these models can be used to improve energy efficiency of the machine learning MapReduce applications running on the Yarn platform. The execution of jobs at their optimal frequencies improves the energy efficiency by average 25% over the default governor setting. In case of mixed workloads, the energy efficiency improves by up to 10% when we use an optimal CPU-frequency across the cluster. © 2016 IEEE.","CPU-Frequency Tuning; Distributed Computing; Energy Efficiency; MapReduce; Predictive Models","Distributed computer systems; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy utilization; Governors; Green computing; Learning systems; Multiprocessing systems; Parallel processing systems; Power management; Voltage scaling; Distributed processing systems; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Frequency-tuning; Map-reduce; MapReduce clusters; Performance Model; Power aware system; Predictive models; Energy efficiency",,"Zheng R.Lovas R.Liao X.Shen X.","IEEE Computer Society",15219097,9781509044573,PIPSF,,"English","Proc Int Conf Parallel Distrib Syst ICPADS",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018480554

Most of the OLAP systems come with a tightly integrated user interface for querying and visualisation of data without the core OLAP operations exposed as an API. Advanced BI applications can be developed and composed to create complex workflows if the OLAP operations are available as an API. In addition, a Web Service based API would enable applications to use Service Oriented Architecture for Big Data Analytics and also easily be deployed on a Cloud. This paper documents the design and prototyping of an OLAP based Platform as a Service, termed OLAP as a Service (OLaaS). OLaaS exposes the core OLAP operations of OLAP Cube design, Slicing, Dicing, Rollup and Drilldown and data retrieval as RESTful Web Services for application programming and composition. Syntax and parsing logic for the Web Service call parameters is developed and an engine for Multidimensional Query (MDX) construction for the OLAP operations is developed. The Web Services are designed to use an existing OLAP engine for running the generated MDX queries. For flexibility and processing huge data sizes, data movement is allowed to be programmed using source and destination database sources set as parameters to the developed OLAP operation services. The designed OLaaS services are implemented in Java and integrated with the open-source Mondrian OLAP engine Olap4j. Standard OLAP Cube data is used to test and validate the OLaaS and its OLAP services. The prototyped OLaaS services have successfully passed the testing and validation. The performance of the services is evaluated on the test data and is found that the overhead of the REST request parsing and MDX query generation is comparable with the standalone MDX query processing time. © 2016 IEEE.","BI; Big Data; Cloud; MDX; OLAP; REST; Web Service; Work Flow","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Bismuth; Cloud computing; Clouds; Commerce; Computation theory; Data handling; Engines; Information services; Open source software; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Query languages; Query processing; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Syntactics; User interfaces; Visualization; Websites; Application programming; Complex workflows; Multi-dimensional queries; OLAP; Operation services; REST; RESTful Web services; Work-flows; Web services",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045730,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Existing literature on k - coverage does not consider residual energy levels and actual battery discharge rate of ACTIVE nodes. OBSP (Optimized Backoff Sleep Protocol) considers the residual energy level information and battery discharge rate but ignores the k-coverage degree. This paper proposes k-CGP (k-Coverage Guarantee Protocol) based on battery discharge curve using polynomial regression for different coverage degrees (k). k-CGP determines the optimal wakeup rate of sleeping nodes by computing Optimal Sleep Time derived from battery discharge curve using polynomial regression and Received Signal Strength Indicator for distance estimation. The coverage redundancy is computed by using equi-distance test. Due to this, a sufficient number of ACTIVE nodes could be maintained while achieving lesser energy consumption in the network. Simulation results show that k-CGP achieves higher energy savings and sensing area coverage as compared to PEAS. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery discharge rate; Coverage degree; Coverage redundancy; Energy efficiency; Optimal duty cycle; Regression analysis","Electric batteries; Electronic equipment; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Redundancy; Regression analysis; Sensor nodes; Sleep research; Thermoelectric equipment; Battery discharge; Battery discharge curves; Coverage degree; Distance estimation; Distributed sensor networks; Duty-cycle; Polynomial regression; Received signal strength indicators; Wireless sensor networks","More, A.; Mukesh Patel School of Technology, Management and Engineering, NMIMS UniversityIndia; email: avinash.more@nmims.edu",,"IEEE Computer Society",21592047,9781509053063,,,"English","Int.

Even for a course whose objective is not to teach a particular language, instructors often specify the language in which learners should code. Instructor-supplied feedback on such assignments may include individualized feedback and model solutions, but it rarely takes the form of an in-class discussion of the varied approaches selected by learners. In this paper, we argue that such discussions provide important opportunities for learning that can cut across course boundaries. Therefore, we suggest that a secondary aim of programming assignments should be to promote such in-class discussions. We also demonstrate how we were successfully able to promote meaningful discussions in a course that rarely has programming assignments (Theory of Computation) by permitting learners to select the language of their choice. Lastly, we identify a need for assessment tools that can automatically identify solutions that are worthy of in-class discussions. © 2016 IEEE.","automated assessment; Programming assignments; theory of computation","Computation theory; Assessment tool; Automated assessment; In-class discussions; Model solution; Programming assignments; Theory of computation; Teaching",,"Kumar V.KinshukMurthy S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061150,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Also it is observed that good connectivity does not imply perfect resilience against node compromise. Resilience is the measure of ability of survival of the network in hostile environment.

Clique-based formulation of this problem employing maximum flow implementation turns out to be an optimization task limiting the solution to be an approximate one. On the other hand, an iterative method building the hotspots (dense sub-graphs) in an incremental manner starting from primitive graph entities looks more practical and more conducive to incorporating application specific characteristics of interest. Motivated by this idea, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting dense sub-graphs based on spectral graph theory. The underlying principle is that the largest eigenvalue of a graph is a numerical indicator of the inherent dense connectivity. Accordingly, our algorithm starts from the egonets (sub-graphs) of individual nodes and determines the dense egonets as the primitive entities based on their eigenvalues. It then discovers hotspots (dense sub-graphs) through iterative merging of the dense egonets in a controlled manner.

Thus Network on chips (NoCs) has provided reliable and scalable solution for communication across cores which mostly use mesh topologies. But 2D NoCs faces the issue of increase in the network diameter which introduces area and power constraints. Thus 3D NoCs has been introduced which provides an alternate interconnect technology and uses the benefits of both NoCs and 3D ICs. 3D NoCs although sustains the performance and growth of increased cores integration but suffer from the issue of faults due to heterogeneous cores integration on different layers, fabrication defects, power saving schemes, component failures etc. which may lead to irregular architecture. Thus to provide efficient routing for such irregular architecture of 3D NoCs is a challenge. This paper extends the capabilities of Segment Routing algorithm by providing formal model for irregular 3D NoCs to enhance its fault tolerance. The Segment Routing is topological agnostic and workable for 2D and 3D meshes but is inefficient for irregular 3D NoCs. The paper extends the concept of segmentation to introduce new segments in Segment Routing algorithm and handles 3D faults using bidirectional turn restrictions. The validation of a Topology Agnostic Routing Algorithm using Segmentation Strategy (TARAS) is performed using theorems which provides concrete definitions to satisfy essential properties of 3D NoCs and enables efficient fault tolerant routing in irregular 3D NoCs. © 2016 IEEE.","3D Network on Chip; fault; interconnects; routing; segment","Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Distributed computer systems; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Faulting; Image segmentation; Integrated circuit interconnects; Network architecture; Optical interconnects; Routers; Routing algorithms; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Topology; 3D networks; Component failures; Fabrication defects; Fault tolerant routing; Heterogeneous cores; Interconnect technology; routing; segment; Network-on-chip","Mitra, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: priyanka.mitra.vit@gmail.com","Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Mainly WSN was used for military arena but now a days it is used in various area like industrial applications, consumer applications, health care applications and many more. Despite of having many advantages there are some issues also occurred in WSNs like hotspot problem, energy hole problem, routing, coverage problem, load balancing problem and so on. These issues effect on different factors of WSN named energy consumption, stability, quality, deployment time, lifetime of network, which degrade the performance of the WSN. To solve these issues various researchers develop different mechanisms. Among all of them, in this paper, we survey different kind of soft computing paradigms.

Hierarchical routing is energy-efficient and useful in several situations. It can be basically categorized in two types. First one is typical hierarchical routing protocols and second one is atypical hierarchical routing protocols. However, there are no such significant differences between both of them because atypical protocols are just a subset of typical hierarchical routing protocols. There are various survey papers which focus on typical routing protocols and very few papers which cover especially atypical routing protocols.

These tasks may consist of very complex functions and large calculations. In order to make network alive for a long duration, these sensors have to take decision in judicious and efficient manner. The increased lifetime results into increased connectivity. Also, the intellectual use of energy resources provides the nodes better connectivity to the base station. The different clustering protocols such as Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) are used in order to gain energy efficiency. The LEACH uses probability as the key attribute to elect the new cluster head. In this paper, a new approach based on the frequency of a node selected as cluster head for the selection of new cluster head is proposed which is also more efficient than the former one. The proposed approach for cluster head selection results in increased lifetime and thus, in increased connectivity.

One of the ways of doing it is by using a global positioning system (GPS). However, systems based on GPS consume larger amount of power and may fail in covered regions. Moreover changing batteries frequently is also a problem. In this paper we have discussed the design and implementation of an energy-efficient cross-layered protocol stack for an application of wireless sensor networks aimed at tracking the co-ordinates of a mobile entity for habitat monitoring. We have implemented this on TelosB motes using TinyOS. This paper focuses on development of protocols pertaining to three layers of the stack viz. physical layer, MAC layer and application layer. The protocols implemented include variants of timing-sync protocol for sensor networks, weighted centroid localization and sensor medium access control (SMAC). Our SMAC variant forms the basic framework upon which the localization and time synchronization algorithms are implemented in the data period and synchronization period, respectively. The results of the designed protocols are significant and demonstrate the potential of the performance of the protocol stack. © 2016 IEEE.","cross layered protocol stack; habitat monitoring; SMAC; TelosB motes; TinyOS; TPSN; WCL; Wireless sensor networks","Access control; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Global positioning system; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Network layers; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Habitat monitoring; Protocol stack; SMAC; TelosB motes; TinyOS; TPSN; Wireless sensor networks",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

So we are proposing the scheme for Channel Allocation in Cognitive Radio by using Game Theory by extracting the best of the four individual sensing methods, eliminating the maximum disadvantages of the sensing techniques. We developed the cognitive radio networks and in which we are also balanced the load between all the channels using game theory. We created 5 elements network / 5channel then check the load one by one in these channel or compare all the channel parallel. Suppose one channel have more load then others then we are sorting the channel load and again compare all the channels. But in some critical situation sometimes the load is not change properly, and wherein one channel has more load and other channel has less load then at that time we have to sort very carefully. Suppose one channel have more load then the load has to be reduced by -step and if other channel has less load then it has to be increased by +step. Thus by creating +step or -step load the network has been balanced properly in the channels of cognitive radio network. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed approach has better effect and capacity. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Flowchart; Game Theory; Load Balancing","Computation theory; Flowcharting; Game theory; Plasma diagnostics; Radio; Radio systems; Resource allocation; Software radio; Channel allocation; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio technologies; Dynamic spectrum management; Sensing techniques; Software-defined radios; Spectrum communications; User communication; Cognitive radio",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Despite its various advantages, it has a threat of high energy consumption from both computing servers and communication fabric. Most of the existing work for reducing Data Center energy consumption is focused at computing servers only. The goal of the proposed work is to minimize the energy consumption at both computing servers and communication devices. Enhanced weighted Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scheduling Algorithm(DVFS) for assigning tasks to virtual machine is implemented for minimizing energy consumption of the computing servers. Also availability of renewable energy powered Data Centers is checked for scheduling jobs. Networking devices such as switches, routers which are part of the communication fabric also contribute to the major energy consumption in the cloud Data Centers. In this work for reducing energy consumption from networking components of the Data Center is addressed by extending Energy-Efficient Network Aware Scheduling (DENS) with stochastic hybrid load balancer.

Classifiers provide poor performance when such dataset are feed into it for categorization due to their high dimension. The most important attributes are extracted from the dataset prior to classification for efficient classifier design. It is also true that there may be many classifiers of a particular system, some provide better accuracy than others but selection of single classifier with all its optimized parameters is always not a good choice for various real world applications. The paper proposes a novel method for construction of an ensemble classifier by combining multiple classifiers obtained using Rough Set Theory and Genetic algorithm. The method selects the classifiers for integration based on accuracy and develops an efficient and effective ensemble classification system. In the first phase of the work, rule based classifiers termed as base classifiers are constructed from the reduced information sub systems obtained using Rough Set Theory, where a set of high quality rules are generated for each sub system. In the second phase, base classifiers are combined and an optimal ensemble classification system is developed using Genetic Algorithm.

Although MANET plays a great role in modern development of commercial applications, it is vulnerable to various kinds of security attacks among which one of the major concerns is dropping packets by selfish nodes. At the same time, malicious nodes also need to be avoided to provide secure routing. Here, based on Packet Forward Rate (PFR) and Route Density Factor (RDF), a new scheme based on game theory has been developed that will detect selfish nodes and avoid malicious nodes of the system for packet transmission. During data transmission if any node of the selected path moves out of the radio range, then an alternate backup route will be formed from that position so that data transmission never stops. So, this scheme guarantees secure routing and constructs alternate backup route for guaranteed packet transmission. This scheme also ensures minimum amount of idle time. © 2016 IEEE.","backup route; manet; pfr; rdf; selfish node","Computation theory; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Game theory; Mobile security; Network security; Radio transmission; Wireless ad hoc networks; Backup routes; Commercial applications; Dynamic network; manet; Modern development; Packet transmissions; Security attacks; Selfish node; Mobile ad hoc networks",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The redundant data collection in dense network results in more energy consumption. The Data Routing In-Network Aggregation (DRINA) is one of the recent algorithm proposed to reduce energy consumption in dense network environment by minimizing the number of communications from source to sink. Here the Data transmission is carried out by using data aggregation in cluster based environment using shortest path method. But due to inefficient cluster head selection technique, it is unable to mange cluster head failures and evades the energy drain in sensor nodes along the common static path that leads network partition. In order to overcome these problems we proposed an algorithm known as Energy Efficient Routing using Dynamic Cluster approach (EBDRA), that includes efficient cluster head selection technique and dynamic route selection for the reliable data transmission. In our approach the cluster head selection technique involves an efficient method of cluster head selection.

Some important applications of WSN are military, machine surveillance, preventive maintenance, disaster relief operations etc. In this type of network, routing is a little bit more complex as compared to ordinary wireless or wired networks. The routing protocols those are applied for different types of the other networks cannot be used here because here in WSN, nodes are battery powered. Due to this, WSN should be the energy efficient. Entire network lifetime is depending on efficient energy consumption in sensor network. Clustering is one of the techniques to utilize the energy of network efficiently. This method consumes extra communication overhead in exchanging messes for selecting appropriate cluster head. This type of transmission of message from node to node consumes extra energy that makes energy resources inefficient. This paper provides an approach to prolong the WSN lifetime using fuzzy logic based selection of cluster head that provides completely non probabilistic approach. This approach uses two fuzzy variables: Base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. In this approach multi-hop communication is used. One cluster Head (CH) has the authority to communicate with the other CH and also with the BS.

The quality and quantity of these natural resources has degraded over the years due to various economic problems associated with increased cost of inputs, decreased farm incomes, ever declining land, labour, energy resources and also ecological problems such as soil, water pollution and soil erosion, putting the viability of future agricultural operations at risk. The remedy to this is to adopt sustainable agriculture which supports careful management and cultivation of crops involving less use of fertilizer, pesticides, calculated use of precious natural resources like energy, water through controlled irrigation and fertigation practices with the help of green sensor technology and electronic control systems. The paper provides efficient automated farm monitoring and irrigation techniques which incorporate wide range of sensors to remotely sense and monitor various parameters of the soil like temperature, moisture, fertility and regulate the supply of water and fertilizer to the land based on the requirement. An algorithm formulated with the threshold values of sensor outputs is used to code the microcontroller which performs the required actions by employing relays until the strayed-out parameter has been brought back to its optimum level. The cloud based user friendly interface facilitates real-Time data logging of environmental parameters while also supporting analysis of past statistics for future growth by means of a web-based customizable application.

In such architectures different phases of the application are executed on different cores to improve performance and energy efficiency. However, restricting the cores to a single ISA limits the achievable performance gain. Different phases of applications also have shown affinity towards different ISAs due to their characteristics, functionality etc. Heterogeneous ISA architectures thus attempt to execute these different phases on their respective affine cores to fully harness ISA diversity. However, in such architectures, estimating the best migration point from one ISA to another, is an open research problem.

Therefore it is going to be backbone of future broadband network. Multi-cell Massive MIMO system reused orthogonal pilot sequence which results in pilot contamination. Pilot contamination causes poor channel estimation at the BS and degrades the performance of the system. In the proposed scheme downlink performance is improved by using fractional frequency reuse for pilot signal. All the available pilot signals are equally divided among the cells as per the cluster size (N=1, 3, 7). BS estimates the channel on receiving the uplink pilot signal transmitted by each user terminal. For each user terminal beam forming vector is calculated which is the function of estimated channel to transmit the downlink data. Uplink Pilot Signal to Interference Plus Noise (PSINR), SINR and terminal capacity for the downlink are calculated for the given number of user terminals using linear precoding schemes which are the function of the estimated channel. These parameters are calculated in the presence of composite fading i.e. large scale and small scale fading.

By using clustering approach, the energy consumption of nodes in the network can be decreased thereby increasing its lifetime. In various multi-hop cluster-based routing protocols, nodes nearer to the Base Station (BS) exhaust their energy quickly than other nodes as data from the entire network is forwarded to BS through them. Due to this, nearby nodes die sooner and network get partitioned. This is known as hot spot problem. This paper proposes a load balanced and energy efficient data collection scheme using data mule for larger network area. The proposed protocol is based on the centralized approach which uses fixed clustering. In this protocol, the BS divides the whole network into fixed rectangular shaped clusters of unequal size. The size of the cluster is dependent on its distance from the central vertical path of the data mule. To overcome from more energy loss at the clusters nearer to this vertical path due to more data handling, proposed protocol introduces unequal size grid clustering approach. It also ensures that the transmission distance for any communication in the network is less than the threshold distance of the energy consumption model. It also increases load balancing in terms of energy consumption and data traffic. It can provide better solution to hot spot problem and hence can improve network lifetime with respect to other existing routing protocols. © 2016 IEEE.","Anchor point (AP); Base Station (BS); Cluster Head (CH); Cluster Member (CM); Data Mule; Grid; Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Base stations; Data acquisition; Data handling; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Anchor point; Cluster head; Cluster Member (CM); Data mules; Grid; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This dissipation of energy is in the form of power dissipation and plays a very important role as far as low power design is considered. Today, most digital circuits are being designed using Reversible Logic. Design based on Reversible Logic helps in reducing heat dissipation, allowing nearly energy free computation, allowing higher circuit densities and enabling better testing of faults. In this paper, a novel design for a Reversible 8-bit ALU is proposed. The 8-bit ALU is designed by cascading 1-bit ALUs. The two major units of a 1-bit ALU are the control unit and the adder unit. For the control unit, the Control Output Gate (COG) has been used and for the adder unit the Haghparast and Navi Gate (HNG) has been used. The most significant aspect of this paper is that as compared to other papers, this ALU design has reduced gate count, and transistor count. The propagation delay was found to be significantly lesser at a value of 5.52ns when compared with the value of 8.29ns for an existing design.

Since the sensors used in STM are having limited energy and buffer space, designing energy-efficient and buffer-aware message forwarding is quite challenging in an opportunistic STM.

One can see that our future environment will contain lots of devices that will generate the massive amount of automated data. The presence of resource constrained devices, frequent exchange of data and heterogeneous types of network traffic distinguish IoT from the current Internet. Recently, Named Data Networking (NDN) is proposed as a content retrieval solution which directly deals with application generated variable-length, location-independent names to search and pull contents for a requesting user, irrespective of hosting entity. The use of content names for communication support name-based routing, in-network caching, and security which make the NDN more suitable for IoT. In this paper, we propose a NDN-based searching mechanism (named, Search-NDNoT), which can be used to find any smart item augmented with the RFID in real-world in real-time. An energy-efficient data aggregation algorithm is also proposed to maintain up-to-date data on the server. Our proof-of-concept prototype shows the usability of our proposed system. © 2017 ACM.","Icn; IoT; Named Data Networking; Named data networking of things; NDN; NDNoT; RFID","Advanced traffic management systems; Automation; Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Network architecture; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Communication support; Content retrieval; Internet of Things (IOT); Location independent; Named data networkings; NDNoT; Resourceconstrained devices; Searching mechanism; Distributed computer systems",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348393,,,"English","ACM Int.

This paper provides a preventive maintenance approach to access the data, though storage server containing the sensitive data fails. This approach uses a simultaneous copying technique to save the data on both storage server and backup server during the upload process. Thus, when server fails, the data needs of the user can be served by the backup server. Data file is broken into data blocks and these blocks are encrypted and stored in the storage server instead of directly uploading the sensitive data file. Thus, when an intruder gains access to the storage server and tries to access the data, retrieval of the data file is not possible since mapping of files on the data blocks is random and encrypted. This supports preventive maintenance of data which not only secures data but also reduces risk and cost of recovery. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Data deduplication; Preventive maintenance; Sensitive data","Computation theory; Cryptography; Intelligent computing; Maintenance; Preventive maintenance; Random access storage; Back-up servers; Data blocks; Data de duplications; Data files; Sensitive datas; Storage and retrievals; Storage servers; User data; Digital storage","Madhusudhan, V.; Dayananda Sagar College of EngineeringIndia; email: vmadhusudhan91@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

Active VMs with higher computational power are used when the load on the system is high, otherwise, passive VMs are used. We achieve high-availability, load-balancing, fail-over, less energy consumption as well as cost optimisation through clustering of both active as well as passive VMs. To avoid congestion and to adhere the SLA under fluctuating workload, the system can easily switch from one mode to the other under certain conditions.

An efficient energy management strategy for smart homes results in minimized electricity consumption leading to cost savings. Towards this goal, we investigate the impact of environmental factors on home energy consumption. Home energy demand is observed to be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and humidity which are inherently uncertain. Analyzing the impact of these factors on electricity consumption is challenging due to the unpredictability of weather conditions and non-linear relationship between environmental factors and electricity demand. For demand estimation based on these time varying factors, a hybrid intelligent system is developed that integrates the adaptability of neural networks and reasoning of fuzzy systems to predict daily electricity demand. A smart home dataset is utilized to build an unsupervised artificial neural network known as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). We further develop a fuzzy rule based system from the SOM to predict home energy demand.

This study focuses on misbehaviors arising due to the presence of\enskip ""dumb"" nodes [Misra et al. 2014; Roy et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Kar and Misra 2015], which can sense its surroundings but cannot communicate with its neighbors due to shrinkage in its communication range by the environmental effects attributed to change in temperature, rainfall, and fog. However, a dumb node is expected to behave normally on the onset of favorable environmental conditions. Therefore, the presence of such dumb nodes in the network gives rise to impaired connectivity between a subset of nodes and, consequently, results in change in topology. Such phenomena are dynamic in nature and are thus distinct from the phenomena attributed to traditional isolation problems considered in stationary WSNs. Activation of all the sensor nodes simultaneously is not necessarily energy efficient and cost-effective. In order to maintain self-adaptivity of the network, two algorithms, named Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes (CoRD) and Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes Without Applying Constraints (CoRDWAC), are designed. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated through simulation-based experiments. Further, it is also observed that the performance of CoRD is better than the existing topology control protocols-LETC and A1-with respect to the number of nodes activated, overhead, and energy consumption. © 2017 ACM.","Connectivity; Dumb node; Dynamic shrinkage; Self-adaptivity; Wireless sensor network","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Shrinkage; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; Communication range; Connectivity; Dumb node; Dynamic shrinkage; Environmental conditions; Self adaptivity; Topology control protocols; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15564665,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

But it is relatively less explored in higher dimensions. An algorithm to find a shortest isothetic path between two points of a 3D object is presented in this paper. The object intersects with some axis parallel equi-distant slicing planes giving one or more isothetic polygons. We call these polygons as slices. The slice containing the source and destination points are called source and destination slice respectively. A graph is constructed by checking the overlap among the slices on consecutive planes. We call it slice overlap graph. Our algorithm first finds the source and destination slice. Thereafter, it finds the minimum set of slices Πst from the slice overlap graph, that need to be traversed to find SIP. Finally BFS is applied to find a SIP through these set of slices. The advantage of this procedure is that it does not search the whole object to find a SIP, rather only a part of the object is considered, therefore making the search faster. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Breadth first search (BFS); Shortest isothetic path (SIP); Unit grid cube (UGC)","Computation theory; Breadth-first search; Destination points; Digital Objects; Higher dimensions; Overlap graph; Shortest isothetic path (SIP); Two-dimensional objects; Unit grid cube (UGC); Geometry","Biswas, A.; Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, ShibpurIndia; email: barindam@gmail.com","Barneva R.P.Tavares J.M.R.S.Brimkov V.E.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319546087,,,"English","Lect.

Identifying a disease based on mutations is an essential and challenging task in the determination of genetic disorders such as Muscular dystrophy. Silent mutation is a single nucleotide variant does not result in changes in the encoded protein but appear in the variation of codon usage pattern that results in disease. A new ensemble learning-based computational model is proposed using the synonymous codon usage for identifying the muscular dystrophy disease. The feature vector is designed by calculating the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values from the mutated gene sequences and a model is built by adopting codon usage bias pattern. This paper addresses the problem by formulating it as multi-classification trained with feature vectors of fifty-nine RSCU frequency values from the mutated gene sequences. Finally, a model is built based on ensemble learning LibD3C algorithm to recognize muscular dystrophy disease classification. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the classifier shows 90%, which proves that ensemble-based learning, is effective for predicting muscular dystrophy disease. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Codon; Codon usage bias; LibD3C; Positional cloning; RSCU","Computation theory; Intelligent computing; Codon; Codon usage bias; LibD3C; Positional cloning; RSCU; Genes","Sathyavikasini, K.; PSGR Krishnammal College for WomenIndia; email: sathyavikashini@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model has been used to represent the nonlinear system and design the fuzzy controller. The Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) has been used with sliding mode control to design the controller, with an aim to improve the performance of the system by output tracking with disturbance rejection. The proposed controller is better than the conventional PDC based fuzzy controller and has better output tracking efficiency robustness. The proposed methodology has been successfully employed for the well-established benchmark nonlinear system, viz., inverted pendulum on cart.

These days, computing systems are facilitated with multiple cores. Multicore system enables simultaneous execution of multiple applications. These concurrently running applications interfere at main memory. Main memory is a major resource demanded by running threads because it stores data structures that are required for execution of an application. Main memory energy consumption and performance can be improved by reducing the number of operations required to access its memory contents and by limiting the delay to service the memory access. It can be achieved by intelligently scheduling the memory requests and it is underlying memory access scheduler that decides the scheduling of memory accesses. This paper proposes a memory access scheduling scheme, EEPAF, for reducing the energy consumption and improving the performance of main memory. EEPAF, prioritizes reads over writes, exploits row buffer hits, increases bank level parallelism, implement delayed write drain policy and ensures fairness among threads. The results quantify the main memory energy consumption for different workloads under varied core environment and demonstrate significant reduction in power consumption, energy-delay product, and execution time, while improving performance.","Energy Efficiency; Memory Access Scheduler SDRAM; Thread Fairness",,"Modgil, A.; Department of CSE and IT, Jaypee University of Information Technology WaknaghatIndia; email: aastha.modgil90@gmail.com",,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka",21801843,,,,"English","J.

A hardware implementation was also demonstrated using a 2-array scheme with a cross-bar of memristors with asynchronous signals to show software equivalent performance [2]. Both learning and recognition (testing) were done with spiking neurons. However, simulating the neural dynamics for testing is computationally expensive which translated to high energy consumption in hardware. Also, the output is only a digital decision, namely the predicted class, which does not reflect the confidence of the decision. In this paper, we present a methodology for a quick and efficient performance evaluation - based on a DC analysis scheme termed as “Current Space” method implemented in hardware with a cross bar array. Here the input neurons produce analog dc voltage inputs for the crossbar array with learnt resistances (weights) to produce analog current levels at the output neurons. The relative current levels provide an analog measure of the decision i.e. extent of separation of classes (i.e. robustness) in the current space of the different output neurons as opposed to a digital decision based on vigorous vs. no spiking in the SNN network. This output signal is essentially equivalent to a software dot-product of input signals with the learnt weight matrix, as is done for ANNs. This method accurately reflects the classification accuracy of SNNs (correlation of 0.98). It enables fast testing (i.e. 15000× faster) in software which translates to a 25× energy reduction for recognition in hardware by our method compared to SNN based recognition. We show that robustness metric can be used to evaluate noise tolerance in the network to produce a training completion criterion based on immunity to noise. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Crossbar arrays; Neural networks; Noise-tolerance; Recognition; Robustness; Spiking; Supervised hebbian learning; Two-layer networks","Classification (of information); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Learning systems; Network layers; Neurons; Robustness (control systems); Software testing; Crossbar arrays; Hebbian learning; Noise tolerance; Recognition; Spiking; Two-layer network; Neural networks","Prasad, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: sidharth52@gmail.com","Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319686110,,,"English","Lect.

Fuzzy logic control architecture which is placed in the vehicle has been designed to take appropriate decision based on the various parameters inside the vehicle. Number of input and output parameters and rules of operation can be varied easily in the fuzzy logic toolbox in MATLAB. The output will be sent to the micro-controller using RS232 serial communication. Now the micro-controller will take the appropriate action to execute the command received. So in order to communicate with other vehicle we have used GPS receiver which will transmit the current position of the vehicle to nearby vehicle ranging within 30 or 100 m using Zigbee communication in a common transmission frequency. If there is any vehicles present in this range it will accept and communicate back by sending the corresponding GPS location of that vehicle and the path of its course. If it is found to be moving on the same direction or path a communication with the vehicle will be established and data will be transmitted among them to achieve the safe and smooth traffic travel to increase the vehicle efficiency. The same rules will apply if there is more than one vehicle is present in the transmitting range. All these transmitting data will be privacy protected.

The transposed form block FIR filter based on distributed arithmetic proves to best suit the requirements of such application. Therefore, this paper presents a new energy efficient, multiplier-less transposed form block FIR filter architecture for reconfigurable applications using distributed arithmetic based approach. The proposed architecture provides improved area-delay product (ADP) and reconfigurability by employing efficient coefficient storage unit and multiplication using add-and-shift logic, respectively. The synthesis results at FPGA level show that the proposed architecture exhibits 13.15% and 13.33% reduced energy per sample for the filter length 64 with a block size of 4 and 8 samples respectively, over the existing design.

With increasing demand for cloud services models, some new challenges in cloud computing are also gaining importance. Increasing energy concern has not even spared cloud environment for considering energy conscious solutions. The scheduling problem for cloud environment has a lot of awareness as the cloud subscriber's tasks could be mapped to the available resources to achieve better results. Traditional heuristics are popularly used to obtain schedules for given tasks and resources. Best efforts results from these heuristics depend upon the tasks and resources at disposal. Meta-heuristic-based scheduling solutions are iterationbased solutions. Meta-heuristic performs search over solution space and converges in minimum number of iterations. A novel heuristic Nearest Neighbour (NN) and a hybrid variant of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) as Nearest Neighbour Cost-Aware PSO (NNCA-PSO) have been proposed and implemented in this paper. Performance of NNCA-PSO has been evaluated for various parameters like makespan, energy consumption, utilisation and economic efficiency.

Prediction error is calculated using the prediction made by GARCH model and actual traffic pattern.

These constraints make security in WSNs a challenge. In this paper, a survey of security issues in WSNs is presented and a new algorithm TESDA is proposed, which is an optimized energy efficient secured data aggregation technic. The cluster head is rotated based on residual energy after each round of aggregation so that network lifetime increases. Based on deviation factor calculated, the trust weight is assigned, if more deviation, then the trust value is less. Simulation results observed by using NS-2.

Secondly, the key based chaotic scheme is used to disperse the bits of the secret message randomly into edge pixel of the image to produce the stego image that take advantage of edge detection techniques.

It has been used to control home entertainment systems and household activities. One of the main parameters to control in a smart home is the atmospheric comfort. Atmospheric comfort mainly includes temperature and relative humidity. In homes, the desired temperature of different rooms varies from 20 to 25 °C and relative humidity is around 50 %. Hence, automated measurement of these parameters to ensure comfort assumes significance. To achieve this, a fuzzy logic controller using Arduino was developed using MATLAB. In the present work, soft sensor was introduced in this system that can indirectly measure temperature and humidity and can be used for processing several measurements. The Sugeno method was used in the soft sensor in MATLAB and then interfaced to the Arduino, which is again interfaced to the temperature and humidity sensor DHT11. The comfort sensor developed was able to measure temperature and relative humidity correctly. Depending on the comfort percentage, the air conditioners and the coolers in the room were controlled.

The clustering algorithm proposed earlier performs clustering on every round basis. On-demand clustering is a recent approach which eradicates the every round based clustering by performing clustering when it is required. But the on-demand clustering approaches proposed so far use equal clustering where clusters are of almost equal size thus, it suffers from the hot spot problem. Therefore, to solve the hot spot problem, a fuzzy logic-based unequal clustering approach is proposed along with an on-demand-based clustering.

Exploring the whole room would prove to be extremely expensive in terms of both computing power and time. To address this issue, we demonstrate a fast algorithm to reduce the search space by identifying possible object locations as two classes, namely - Support Structures and Clutter. Support Structures are plausible object containers in a scene such as tables, chairs, sofas, etc. Clutter refers to places where there seem to be several objects but cannot be clearly distinguished. It can also be identified as unorganized regions which can be of interest for tasks such as robot grasping, fetching and placing objects. The primary contribution of this paper is to quickly identify potential object locations using a Support Vector Machine(SVM) learnt over the features extracted from the depth map and the RGB image of the scene, which further culminates into a densely connected Conditional Random Field(CRF) formulated over the image of the scene. The inference over the CRF leads to assignment of the labels - support structure, clutter, others to each pixel. There have been reliable outcomes even during challenging scenarios such as the support structures being far from the robot. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy and speed of the algorithm irrespective of alterations to camera angles, modifications to appearance change, lighting and distance from locations etc. Copyright © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Specifically, in battery powered real-time embedded systems where tasks are executed under hard timing constraints, energy optimisation poses a big challenge. This paper focuses on dynamic energy optimisation using a well-established technique namely dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). This work presents a real-time scheduling algorithm that uses DVFS on mixed task system containing periodic as well as aperiodic tasks on homogeneous multi-core processor. The proposed algorithm guarantees periodic task deadlines and offers minimum aperiodic task response times. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed scheme saves more energy as compared to cycle conserving, static FVS and non-DVFS scheduling algorithms. Further, it does not result in any response time degradation of aperiodic tasks as compared to other algorithms.

The first cue draws special attention to regions with presence of discontinuities and is constructed by exploiting standard deviation, busyness and entropy measures on the input image and its intrinsic map. The second cue diminishes the chances of broken edge generation by utilizing a population-based global optimisation heuristic (Particle Swarm Optimization) to detect the final edges from highlighted regions of the former cue.

We present a simplified model to an LIF-neuron differential equation [1] to convert current to voltage spikes, synapses for voltage to current conversion and a modified-STDP learning rule [2] to enable hardware implementation (demonstrated by circuit-level simulation [3]). In this paper, we develop a 2-layered SNN model in MATLAB, based on Population Coding [4] and laterally inhibiting output neurons - implementing a Winner-Take-All mechanism [5] and train it under Supervision with our modified-STDP learning rule [2]. Supervision is provided in the form of negative bias currents to output neurons of the incorrect class(es). The network is tested on Fisher Iris and Wisconsin Breast Cancer databases, giving accuracy results (95.3% and 96.5% respectively) comparable to literature in SNN [6, 7].

For state-of-art SNN performance, the smaller size of our network (about 3x fewer neurons) translates to improved hardware density. Further, combination of the greater speed of convergence (i.e. 18x fewer epochs) and 3x fewer neurons and synapse, translates to equivalently reduced energy of learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Energy efficient implementation; Spiking neural networks; Supervised learning; Two-layer networks","Arts computing; Circuit simulation; Computer software; Differential equations; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Intelligent agents; Learning systems; MATLAB; Network layers; Neurons; SPICE; Supervised learning; Circuit-level simulation; Energy efficient; Hardware implementations; Performance degradation; Speed of convergence; Spiking neural networks; Two-layer network; Voltage-to-current conversions; Neural networks","Biswas, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: anmolbiswas@gmail.com","Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319686110,,,"English","Lect.

Online social media serves as a platform to show these relationships, whether friendly or unfriendly, like or dislike, agreement or dissension, trust or distrust. These types of interactions lead to the emergence of Signed Social Networks (SSNs) where positive sign represents friend, like, trust, agreement and negative sign represents foe, dislike, distrust and disagreement. Although an immense body of work has been dedicated to the field of social networks; the field of SSNs remains not much explored. This survey first frames the concept of signed networks and offers a brief discourse on the two most prevalent theories of social psychology applied to study them. Then, we address the various state-of-the-art issues which relates the real world scenarios with signed networks. Grounded along the network attributes, this survey talks about the different metrics used to analyze these networks and the real world datasets used for observational purposes.

Sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station. In recent years, such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas. Generally, sensor nodes are small, cost-effective, memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment. Energy is one of the significant factors in such network. Whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place. Sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster. The purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way. A cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station. An efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption, thereby increasing network lifetime. One major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round, cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region. This process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head. Transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource. In this paper, a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the WSNs lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed. In this, whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (GH) using two fuzzy variables, viz., base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. This approach uses a multi-hop communication approach. GH nodes are authorized to communicate with other GH nodes and base station. Simulation results show that the proposed approach prolongs WSNs network lifetime than existing ones. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Fuzzy logic; Grid head; Non-probabilistic; Wireless sensor networks","Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head selections; Consumption of energy; Environmental conditions; Grid head; Multi hop communication; Non-probabilistic; Processing capability; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Kumar, V.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of TechnologyIndia; email: vimalmnnit16@gmail.com","Sahana S.K.Saha S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811025242,,,"English","Adv.

As direct transmissions are costly, multi-hop approach is often used to collect the data of the nodes at the sink. However, many-to-one communication pattern in multi-hop communication may result in an unbalanced energy consumption in the network. Nodes closer to the sink deplete their energy at a faster rate than nodes that are further away. Mixed transmission approach, where each node trades-off between the cheaper hop-by-hop transmission and costlier direct transmission, is a good solution for balancing energy consumption. This paper proposes a receiver contention based mixed transmission scheme for energy balancing. In addition to distance and residual energy of the receivers, it also considers the link reliability and the number of neighboring nodes, in setting of the timer that will determine the relay node selection. The proposed approach gives more efficient and effective energy balanced data transmission as compared with the other works proposed in the literature. Its performance is evaluated and presented both analytically and through simulations, and the analytical estimations are validated by the simulation results. The simulation results show a significant improvement over the other closely related approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily used with both uniform as well as non-uniform node deployment. © 2016","Energy balanced data transmission; Energy-efficiency; Mixed hop transmission schemes; Routing; Wireless sensor network","Channel capacity; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy balance; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Transmissions; Wireless sensor networks; Analytical estimations; Balancing energy consumption; Energy-balanced; Hop-by-hop transmission; Many-to-one communications; Multi hop communication; Routing; Transmission schemes; Energy efficiency","Kulshrestha, J.; Department of Computer Engineering and Applications, GLA UniversityIndia; email: jagrati.kulshrestha@gla.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994407046

One of the major investigation in the consideration of MWSNs sustains from the problem of system throughput and end-to-end delay along with the issue of energy consumption. This idle illustrates a X-layer network (cross-layer network) transformation model that can decline the problem of energy consumption and along with end-to-end delay in these networks. In this paper, the moderate model restrains four layers in the network transformation: (a) application layer, which has been utilized to update the node locality and information; (b) network layer, which has been accomplished to recognize the routing of the internetwork through links; (c) MAC (medium access control) layer, which has been centralized on the effectiveness of the networks, and (d) physical layer has also been recommended keeping the intentional view on transmission power from sensor node to the sink node. The place/location and position/status of the mobile node is interlinked in the routing transformation immediately as soon as the route finding process is successfully terminated and then it is been employed by controlling the transmission power of the MAC layer to rectify the range of the transmission with respect to the route. As per the future expectations of practical characteristics is concerned, adjacent NB(neighbor) list discovery broadcast will be engaged only for active nodes. But this paper is accomplished an modern technique, i.e., mobility aware protocol, which recognizes the mobility (velocity/speed) of the nodes so that only those respective nodes will be upgraded with its adjacent NB-list broadcasting, resulting in minimum power utilized by the network interface and also in the degradation of the energy consumption of the node’s. In spite of the above concern, one more additional cause approaching in this model is the issue of bottleneck problem, which has been established due to multiple sources resulting in huge packet loss. This issue has been solved by pipe-lining those packets of the sensor which are nearer to the sink node, which results in reduction of end-to-end delay and energy utilization resulting in high system throughput. Through NS-II simulation, the results of energy consumption, system throughput, end-to-end delay, etc., has been shown. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","End-to-end delay; Energy efficiency; IEEE 802.15.4 protocol; Mobile WSNs; System throughput; X-layer network transformation model","Access control; Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent computing; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Packet networks; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Standards; Throughput; Wireless sensor networks; End to end delay; IEEE 802.15.4; Layer networks; Mobile WSNs; System throughput; Network layers","Mohiddin, M.K.; Department of ECE, GITAM UniversityIndia; email: khwaja7388@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

As well, such information may be spatially mapped and used for further analysis on pattern comparisons. A key objective of such analytic works would be to come up with effective interventions, including planning for remedial measures.

A game-theoretic representation was also formulated, using one of the oldest game playing techniques, the minimax algorithm to solve this problem. It exploited the adversary like situation between the intruder and the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and the essence of this approach lies in the assumption that the intruder and the IDS have complete knowledge of the network and each other’s strategy. The solution for the intrusion detection problem via game theory gives the detection probability by which the IDS can detect the malicious packets on a given network when the probabilities with which the intruder sends the malicious packets on the various paths leading him to the target are known to the IDS. However, in the real world scenario, the role of the intruder and the IDS is dynamic, if the attack is detected or goes undetected the intruder tries to breach the network again with a different approach or the IDS tries to defend the network with a different strategy respectively. The next strategy for either of the two can be learnt by experience and thus, this paper, models an artificial neural network to represent this game-theoretic representation. The modeled neural network gives the detection probability of an attack by the IDS when the probabilities of sending malicious packets on the various paths leading the intruder to the target are given as an input pattern to the neural network. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural network; Game theory; Intrusion detection","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Game theory; Mercury (metal); Network security; Neural networks; Probability; Problem solving; Detection probabilities; Game-theoretic; Input patterns; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious packets; Minimax algorithm; Neural network model; Real-world scenario; Intrusion detection","Kaushik, P.; Computer Science and Engineering, NIT-HamirpurIndia; email: pallavikaushik27@gmail.com","Luhach A.K.Raman B.Singh D.Lingras P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811057793,,,"English","Commun.

Logic Based Distributed Routing (LBDR) has been proposed as a flexible fault tolerant routing implementation framework for Mesh-Based NoCs with link and router faults. The routing logic overhead remains invariant to the size of the topology making it scalable. LBDR is restricted to provide only minimal paths and can not support all failures. d2-LBDR was developed to support non-minimal paths and thus would handle all single and double link permanent failures. Though, d2-LBDR successfully covers all single and double link permanent failures but still restricts the available number of fault-free paths. In this paper, we present how this limitation on the available number of fault-free paths affects NoC performance. Based on our analysis, we present a new selection logic which enhances d2-LBDR to explore all available fault-free paths. Our proposed solution having a marginal overhead in area and power provides higher performance (7% improvement in average flit latency and 4% improvement in average network throughput when subject to two link faults in a 64-Node NoC). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Fault tolerance; Logic based routing; Network-on-Chip","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Fault tolerance; Mesh generation; Network architecture; Routers; Servers; VLSI circuits; Distributed routing; Fault tolerant routing; High performance computing; Logic based routing; Network-on-chip(NoC); On chip communication; Submicron technologies; Transistor scaling; Network-on-chip","Jain, A.; Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: anugrahjain4u@gmail.com","Kaushik B.K.Dasgupta S.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811074691,,,"English","Commun.

The core predicaments associated with MANETs encompass limited bandwidth availability, quick topology changes due to nodes’ mobility within the network, network partitioning, link-layer contentions, dynamic wireless channel characteristics and inadequate energy resources. Consequently, traditional routing strategies of MANETs should consider the exceedingly random nature (e.g., dynamic network and node status changes) into the routing scheme design. However, in the past, several authors have expressed concern towards deprived forwarding schemes in MANETs, which contributes to the consumption of excess energy in network. Consequently, it causes high risk of network disconnections as well. Hence, considering higher energy consumption in MANETs as a problem, many researchers have presented numerous smart routing paradigms in past. Still, many of these suggested schemes drastically failed in achieving the desired quality of service (QoS) in network. Further, the pattern of interest shifts towards the cross-layer energy optimization schemes. These ideas did use of lower layers’ special information explicitly in order to run the network efficiently. Furthermore, considering the sleep and idle energy consumption, the researchers have suggested many more solutions in the past. Nevertheless, these methods require complex synchronization and efficient coordination which is too inefficient for extremely variable networks (MANETs). To address these issues, we propose an efficient fuzzy based energy efficient load distribution scheme considering congestion as a major concern. This paper compares the performance of the proposed method, ELBRP and AODV via simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed method offers better Throughput performance, lesser Energy Consumption, lesser number of Dead nodes, elongate Network’s Lifetime than other approaches. Additionally, the simulation results confirm that the proposed method suggests better Normalized Routing and Normalized MAC Load (Total Network Over-head) than other approaches as well. ©2017 Old City Publishing, Inc.","Ad-hoc networks; Energy efficiency; Energy optimization; Fuzzy system; Routing",,"Kumar, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jaypee University of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: mahesh.chahar@gmail.com",,"Old City Publishing",15519899,,,,"English","Ad-Hoc Sens.

However, they did not provide any mathematical background and their approach was too simplistic. Hence, it could not be directly applied to complex process systems such as absorber, regenerator and distillation columns. Linh et al. (2012) reported resilience analysis considering physical failure of the process systems to improve the safety of process plants. In contrast to physical failure of process systems, quantification of system resilience has been carried out considering performance failure of process systems under this work. The inherent resilience for process systems can be conceptualized from the perspectives of material resilience. Correlations have been developed to assess resilience properties of constituent process systems pertaining to a Gas Sweetening Unit (GSU) as a case study. Fig.1 shows the schematic flow diagram of the Gas Sweetening Unit (GSU). A steady state condition has been considered and system stress and system strain equations have been developed to quantify the system resilience. This study has enabled developing a new method for identification of thermodynamically efficient operating capacity regime for optimization of energy usage in process systems. Optimum energy usage for a process system is achieved when it is operated at the most thermodynamically efficient capacity regime and this is evaluated by estimation of newly conceived Thermodynamic Coefficient of Performance (THCOP) data at various capacities. This work provides general formulae for quantification of system resilience properties of one absorber column, one regenerator column, one shell and tube heat exchanger and associated one process as well as one utility pipeline system pertaining to a GSU (Fig.1). It is found that the GSU (Fig.1) operating capacity range of 80%-100% is the most thermodynamically efficient operating capacity regime. The minimum operating capacity for the GSU is considered as 1% whereas the maximum operating capacity is 150%. The design capacity (i.e., 100%) of the GSU is 27814 kg/hr. The GSU is designed to sweeten sour natural gas containing 1.28 wt% of H2S to sweet natural gas containing less than or equal to 1 ppmw H2S. It is found that absorber column and regenerator column systems under study possesses inherent resilience of around 5% and 15% respectively with regard to variation in upstream feed sour gas flow rate beyond 100% design flow rate, i.e., 27814 kg/h. It is also found that the lean-rich exchanger system under study possesses inherent resilience of around 10% with regard to variation in upstream feed sour gas flow rate beyond 100% design flow rate. It is noticed that the inlet feed sour gas pipeline system (process pipeline) indicates drastic fall in modulus of resilience value (Ur) and great increase in modulus of elasticity (Esys) value above feed gas mass flow rate of 100% indicating attainment of allowable pressure drop and limiting or yielding stress. © 2017 AIChE.

Disconnection results in nonfunctional WSN, although other nodes remain operational. Even owing to one node failure can results in end of whole network and we have to deploy the whole WSN again.

The innovative combinational based characteristic of neural fuzzy-based closed-loop hybrid system proposing a five-layered approach with technical ideas, solutions solve the critical problems in the field of character, face, symbol recognition procedure, and estimating the density ratio. Recognition of single text, numbers is easy than the recognition of mixed connective conjunct consonants. Because of their variations, various handwritten pen-stroke pulses, tuning the initial and end position of each conjunct consonant, some consonants are connected and mixed with their left-cum right-side placed conjuncts, numerals, and symbols.

We introduce a way of accelerating this computation by dividing the grid domain of the fluid simulation into a narrow band of high resolution grid cells near fluid-solid boundaries and a coarser grid everywhere else. Judiciously reducing the number of high resolution grid cells significantly lowers the cost of the pressure projection step, while not sacrificing the simulation quality. The coarse grid values are upgraded to a finer grid before advecting the fluid surface so that enough degrees of freedom are available to resolve surface detail. We present and analyse two methods to perform this upgradation, namely, velocity interpolation and pressure field smoothing. We discuss the merits and demerits of each and quantify the errors introduced in the simulation as a function of size of the narrow band. Finally, since we are primarily interested in visualizing the fluid animation, we produce rendered fluid simulation output to also validate the visual quality of the simulations. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Eulerian Fluid Simulation; Fluid Animation; Narrow Band Pressure Solve","Animation; Computation theory; Computer graphics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Poisson equation; Eulerian fluids; Fluid animation; Fluid simulations; High-resolution grids; Incompressible fluid; Narrow bands; Simulation quality; Velocity interpolation; Computer vision","Prakash, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: adityap@cse.iitb.ac.in","Bechmann D.Claudio A.P.Braz J.","SciTePress",,9789897582240,,,"English","VISIGRAPP - Proc.

Dynamic power in digital programmable CMOS-based processors depends on the switching activity. Specifically in its subcomponents like FIR filter, power consumption can be directly related to the node switching activity. Minimization of power consumption can be done by reducing the transitions or dissimilarities in filter coefficients. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been found to be very effective for optimized FIR filter design because of nonlinear, nondifferentiable, multimodal and nonconvex nature of the associated optimization problem. However, all the existing evolutionary optimization-based design techniques aim at meeting the frequency domain specifications without concentrating on minimizing power consumption. In the present work, a novel EA, i.e., hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm, has been proposed and further applied for FIR filter design. The filter design task aims at satisfying the dual objectives of meeting the desired frequency domain specifications and power minimization. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial bee colony; Evolutionary optimization; FIR filters; FPGA; Power minimization","Bandpass filters; Digital integrated circuits; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency domain analysis; Integrated circuit design; Optimization; Specifications; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Evolutionary optimizations; Experimental validations; Optimization problems; Power minimization; Switching activities; FIR filters","Ghosh, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, NITIndia; email: aceghosh@gmail.com",,"Birkhauser Boston",0278081X,,CSSPE,,"English","Circ Syst Signal Process",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009821273

Software undergoes changes due to maintenance activities initiated by bug fixing, improved documentation, and new requirements of users. In software, code smells are indicators of a system which may give maintenance problem in future. This paper evaluates six types of machine learning algorithms to predict change-proneness using code smells as predictors for various versions of four Java-coded applications. Two approaches are used: method 1-random undersampling is done before Feature selection; method 2-feature selection is done prior to random undersampling. This paper concludes that gene expression programming (GEP) gives maximum AUC value, whereas cascade correlation network (CCR), treeboost, and PNN\GRNN algorithms are among top algorithms to predict F-measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. Also, GOD and L_M code smells are good predictors of software change-proneness.

However, these well-established metaheuristic strategies are computationally expensive because of their slow convergence rate. Opposition Based Learning (OBL) theory has managed to alleviate this problem to some extent. Through simultaneous consideration of estimates and counter estimates of a candidate solution within a definite search space, better approximation of the candidate solution can be achieved. Although it addresses the slow convergence rate to some extent, it is far from alleviating it completely. The present work proposes a novel approach towards improving the performance of OBL theory by allowing the exploration of a larger search space when computing the candidate solution. Instead of considering all the components of the candidate solution simultaneously, the proposed method considers each of component individually and attempts to find the best possible combination by using a metaheuristic technique. In the present work, this improved Opposition learning theory has been integrated with the classical HS algorithm, to accelerate its convergence rate. A comparative analysis of the proposed method against classical Opposition Based Learning has been performed on a comprehensive set of benchmark functions to prove its superior performance. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

It becomes too expensive when query-packets circulate unnecessarily in the network. These undesirable packets cause the problem of congestion in the network. Time-efficient BERS (tBERS) is one of the controlled flooding techniques that lessens such expenses. From our results, we analysed that its performance in terms of query-retransmission and link-breaks degrade as route-reconstruction problem increases. In such situations, we need to lessen the retransmission of query-packets due to link breaks. In this paper, we have proposed energy-efficient BERS (eBERS) technique that reduces the retransmission of the query-packets. It reduced the retransmission between the magnitude of 15%–20% and energy exhaustion ratio between 29%–56% in tBERS.

The objective here is to ensure reliable communication with minimum intereference to Primary Users (PUs) and efficient spectrum utilization. The spectrum assigned to licensed users is underutilized and the growing demand causes starvation to the unlicensed users. Thus, CRN senses the available spectrum to find the most appropriate spectrum for allocation. Further, to maximize the efficient use of available spectrum, agreement (consensus) may be used wherein all users agree on a common decision value.

However, an attacker can inject update messages into the BGP communication from the peering BGP routers and those routing information will be propagated across the global BGP routers. This could cause disruptions in the normal routing behavior. Specially crafted BGP messages can reroute the traffic path from a source ASN to a specific destination ASN via another path and this attack is termed as AS Path Hijacking. This research work is focused on the detection of suspicious deviation in the AS path between a source and destination ASNs, by analyzing the BGP update messages that are collected by passive peering to the BGP routers. The research mainly focuses on identifying the AS Path Hijacking by quantifying: (1). How far the deviation occurred for a given AS Path and (2). How much credible is the deviated AS path. We propose a novel approach to calculate the deviation occurred by employing weighted edit distance algorithm. A probability score using n-gram frequency is used to determine credibility of the path. Both the scores are correlated together to determine whether a given AS Path is suspicious or not. The experimental results show that our approach is capable of identifying AS path hijacks with low false positives. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Anomaly detection; As path hijacking; Border gateway protocol; N-gram probability; Weighted edit distance","Computation theory; Intelligent computing; Routing protocols; Anomaly detection; AS paths; Border gateway protocol; N-grams; Weighted edit distance; Gateways (computer networks)","Prem Sankar, A.U.; Amrita Center for Cyber Security Systems and Networks, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri CampusIndia; email: premsankar@am.amrita.edu","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

However, this superimposing problem can be resolved by cracking some additional encryption algorithms alongside the visual cryptography.

The mutual visibility problem asks the robots to form a configuration, within finite time and without collision, in which no three robots are collinear. The constrained mutual visibility problem in addition aims to minimize the maximum number of movements by a single robot. One of the implications of this constrained version of mutual visibility problem is that it also addresses issue of energy efficiency. The robots have a constant amount of persistent memory and they are equipped with externally visible lights which can assume a constant number of predefined colors. The colors represent different states of the robots and are used both for internal memory and communication. The colors of the lights do not change automatically. A distributed algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained mutual visibility problem for a set of asynchronous robots using only seven colors. The proposed algorithm does not impose any other restriction on the capability of the robots and guarantees collision-free movements for the robots. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Asynchronous; Mutual visibility; Persistent light; Swarm robotics","Color; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Network security; Robots; Stabilization; Turbo codes; Visibility; Asynchronous; Asynchronous robots; Collision free movement; Euclidean planes; Internal memory; Persistent memory; Single robots; Swarm robotics; Swarm intelligence","Bhagat, S.; Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: sbhagat_r@isical.ac.in","Tsigas P.Spirakis P.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319690834,,,"English","Lect.

If the weights of an MLP are not initialized properly, it may fail to achieve good generalization. In this article, we propose a weight initialization technique for MLP to improve its generalization. This is achieved by a regularized stacked auto-encoder based pre-training method. During pre-training, the weights between each adjacent layers of an MLP, upto the penultimate layer, are trained layer wise by an auto-encoder. To train the auto-encoder, we use weighted sum of two terms: (i) mean squared error (MSE) and (ii) sum of squares of the first order derivatives of the outputs with respect to inputs. Here, the second term acts as a regularizer. It is used to penalize the training of auto-encoder during pre-training to generate better initial values of the weights for each successive layers of MLP. To compare the proposed initialization technique with random weight initialization, we have considered ten standard classification data sets. Empirical results show that the proposed initialization technique improves the generalization of MLP. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Auto-encoder; Initialization; Multi-layer perceptron; Pre-training; Regularization","Classification (of information); Computation theory; Learning systems; Mean square error; Auto encoders; Initialization; Multi layer perceptron; Pre-training; Regularization; Signal encoding","Pal, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, DurgapurIndia; email: tandra.pal@gmail.com","Martin-Vide C.Vega-Rodriguez M.A.Neruda R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319710686,,,"English","Lect.

A node scheduling protocol for target coverage as an extension of energy efficient coverage preserving protocol (EECP), which determined the set covers based on the coverage probability and trust values is proposed.

One of the plausible solutions for the problem can be obtained with the use of Rough Set Theory (RST) and available in the literature. Unfortunately, Rough Set Theory cannot deal with numerical values. One of the classical solutions to this problem can be obtained by using Fuzzy Rough Set. To the best of our knowledge, there is no working Fuzzy-Rough Set based brokerage architecture available which is used for minimizing attributes, search space and for ranking the service providers. In this paper, we proposed a Fuzzy Rough Set based Cloud Brokerage (FRSCB) architecture, which is responsible for service selection based on consumers Quality of Service (QoS) request. We propose to use Fuzzy Rough Set Theory (FRST) to minimize the number of attributes and searching space.

This model enables identification of malicious and unwanted software by amalgamation of multiple detection engines. This paper follows DNA sequence detection process, symbolic detection process, and behavioural detection process to detect various threats. The proposed approach (PMDM) can be deployed on a VMM which remains fully transparent to guest VM and to cloud users. However, PMDM prevents the malicious code running in one VM (infected VM) to spread into another noninfected VM with help of hosted VMM. After detecting malicious code by PMDM technique, it warns the other guest VMs about it.

Due to the mobility of the vehicles, it is quite challenging to find the vacant band and to reuse it for data transmission purpose without affecting the primary network. Further, the presence of primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in the VANET makes this task more complicated. Hence, an accurate detection technique and proper power allocation to the vehicular secondary users (VSUs) are the two major factors which need to be addressed for reliable data transmission. Hence this study attempts to evaluate the performance metrics of the CR-VANET considering the spatial correlation among the local decisions of the VSUs in the presence of PUEA. The energy efficiency maximisation with adaptive power allocation to the VSUs is achieved by the authors' proposed scheme based on genetic algorithm under the constraints of interference power to the primary receiver, minimum achievable data rate and maximum transmission power limit.

Genetic algorithm tuned Fuzzy Controller (GFC) and adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (NFC) is proposed for the purpose, wherein the fuzzy parameters are optimized by genetic algorithm and artificial neural network respectively. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy control technique enjoys powerful learning capability of neural network, whereas genetic algorithm discovers the optimum solutions for the problem. Also a suitable function is proposed for modifying training data set of neuro-fuzzy inference system that leads to Modified Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (MNFC). Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC) are also designed for comparative analysis. Intensive simulation studies are carried out to critically examine the performance of designed controllers on the basis of Integral Absolute Error (IAE), settling time, overshoot and steady state error for set-point tracking, disturbance rejection, noise suppression and simultaneous noise & disturbance rejection.

An efficient retargeting algorithm should not only retain semantic content, but also maintain spatiotemporal resolution of video data. In this paper, the effective seam carving technique for content-aware video retargeting is discussed. Retargeting video is of immense importance as it is frequently played on several gadgets such as television, mobile, tablet, and notebook. The proposed method considers each video frame as an independent image entity and tries to resize it. Our main contribution is a formulation of seam carving using graph cut method. Convention cut techniques fail to defend a meaningful seam. Single monotonic well connected by pixel to pixel is most desirable property in seam carving process. The traditional seam carving method is designed to work based on the minimum energy concept, while ignoring the energy that has been introduced by the operator. To address this issue, we propose a new design criterion in which least amount of energy is introduced in retargeted video. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Output devices; Pixel; Seam carving; Video resizing","Computation theory; Graphic methods; Intelligent computing; Pixels; Semantics; Content-aware video retargeting; Graph-cut methods; Output devices; Processing capability; Seam carving; Spatio-temporal resolution; Video resizing; Video retargeting; Video signal processing","Desai, S.D.; Department of Information Science and Engineering, B.V.B.

The idea behind the proposed technique is to apply PSO on the DWT along with GF to diminish the ringing artifacts, Gaussian noise and improve the radiometric resolution of the images. The overall result shows that proposed technique has improved radiometric information and lesser ringing artifacts than existing methods. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Discrete wavelet transform; Guided image filter; Image compression; Particle swarm optimization","Bandpass filters; Computation theory; Discrete wavelet transforms; Gaussian noise (electronic); Intelligent computing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radiometry; Spectroscopy; Wavelet transforms; Compressed images; Gray-scale images; Guided filters; Guided images; Hyper-spectral images; Multispectral images; Radiometric resolution; Ringing artifacts; Image compression","Vij, N.; Lovely Professional UniversityIndia; email: namrata.20507@lpu.co.in","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

Positional geometry of webpage objects (wireframe) is an important factor for determining the webpage aesthetics as shown in studies. In this paper, we propose a computational model for predicting webpage aesthetics based on the positional geometry. We have considered 13 features of positional geometry that affect aesthetics, as reported in literature. By varying these 13 features, we have designed 52 interfaces’ wireframes and rated them by 100 users in a 5 point rating scale. Our 1 dimensional ANOVA study on users’ rating shows, 9 out of the 13 features are important for webpage aesthetics. Based on these 9 features, we created a computational model for webpage aesthetics prediction. Our computational model works based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). To judge the efficacy of our model, we considered 10 popular webpages’ wireframes, and got them rated by 80 users. Experimental results show that our computational model can predict webpage aesthetics with an accuracy of 90%. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017 Published by Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Several applications can make use of the small perturbation technique discussed in the paper related to industrial control, mechanical nonlinear systems, electrical systems and other systems governed by nonlinear differential equations. This paper presents the power system as an application for use of novel controller to control voltage instability problem. The power system is an electro-mechanical nonlinear dynamical system, and is described by a combination of electrical and mechanical parameter based differential equations together. The power system faces problems related to voltage instability and chaos. Voltage instability exists in almost every power system for a specific set of mechanical power, electrical loading and initial conditions. Voltage instability can be controlled by injecting a small amount of reactive power using a power electronic device called a Static Volt Ampere Reactive Compensator. The amount of reactive power to be injected is trivial for different types and sizes of the power system. To control voltage instability, reactive power in a power system needs to be boosted. Proposed controller output decides amount of reactive power which perturbs the system equation to the stable operating point. The proposed Perturb-Boost Fuzzy Logic Controller differs from conventional controllers due to its single shot boost action, which perturbs system dynamics in such a way as to push it to safe zones of voltage stability. This paper analyzes the performance of the proposed controller to control the voltage instability for the generalized three node power system benchmark model. Reactive power to be injected is momentary due to single shot boost action. Time to reach instability gets delayed by approximately fifteen seconds using proposed controller for the benchmark model. Mitigation of voltage collapse is discussed in view of simulation results using proposed novel controller. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

WSNs comprises of sensor nodes having limited energy as battery powers them. These batteries cannot be changed or recharged as they are operated in a harsh environment. Energy conservation mechanism should be developed. Through study, it is found that clustering is an approach for achieving energy efficiency. In this type of protocols, cluster heads (CH) are chosen among the sensor nodes and then clusters are formed by assigning non-cluster head to the nearest cluster head. Load balancing and the distribution of the cluster heads are the major drawbacks. To deal with the mentioned difficulties, a double optimization based on fuzzy logic approach and harmony search algorithm is proposed in this paper known as fuzzy logic and improved harmony search based clustering (FLIHSBC) algorithm.

WSNs need to be provided with efficient security features generally due to their deployment in inaccessible terrain and also communication being in the wireless domain. Therefore the question of providing security to such networks arises but the major constraints are the limited resources present in the sensor nodes. Prior importance is given to the energy parameter as it is the most vital component of the sensor nodes. So the objective of any intrusion detection framework would be to design robust mechanisms capable of handling attacks in energy efficient manner. Intrusion detection is used in WSNs because of their ability to detect unknown attacks and finding means to thwart them for preserving energy. Therefore energy efficient intrusion detection has become a significant research area for researchers. Keeping this in mind, we survey the major topics of energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs. The survey work presents topics such as the fundamentals of intrusion detection techniques, as well as the various energy saving mechanisms used in different architectural models. The earlier achievements in energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs are also summarized and existing problems are discussed.

Efficient usage of energy is a key issue in WSN application such as target tracking. Another important criterion is a tracking accuracy that can be achieved by using appropriate tracking mechanism. Because of the special characteristic of WSN, there is a trade-off between tracking accuracy and power consumption. Our aim is to improve tracking accuracy as well as provide energy-efficient solution by integrating the concept of clustering and prediction techniques. This paper presents Energy-Efficient Constant Gain Kalman Filter based Tracking (EECGKFT) algorithm to optimize the energy usage and to increase the tracking accuracy. There is also a need to collect data from network having a mobile Base Station (BS). Hence, performance of proposed algorithm is analyzed for a static BS and also for mobile BS. The results depict that proposed algorithm performs better compared to the existing algorithms in energy efficiency and prediction accuracy. Analysis of results validates that EECGKFT increases energy efficiency by reducing transmission of unnecessary data in the sensor network environment and also provides good tracking results. © 2017 Kirti Hirpara and Keyur Rana.",,"Bandpass filters; Clutter (information theory); Economic and social effects; Kalman filters; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Mobile base station; Prediction accuracy; Prediction techniques; Sensor network environment; Tracking accuracy; Tracking mechanism; Wsn applications; Energy efficiency",,,"Hindawi Limited",15308669,,,,"English","Wireless Commun.

These sensor nodes are battery operated and it is difficult to recharge them in the field, so inclusion of energy efficiency is must in the protocols of these networks. Clustering is one of the most popular methods to achieve it. In clustering, the network is divided into various clusters and cluster head of every cluster is responsible to transfer the data to central location (base station). This paper introduces a balanced energy routing protocol based on LEACH-C for WSN. Our proposal not only selects the maximum energy node as cluster head but also distributes the load among the various clusters evenly. This balances the energy consumption among various nodes hence increases the lifetime of the network. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol through simulation indicates a significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency as compared to other well-known protocols.

This condenses load balancing in the network. If the cluster heads collaborate with each other and transfer data based on multihop transmission, then the cluster heads nearer to the sink node are burdened with significant relay traffic and deplete energy much faster, which causes a network coverage problem also known as a hot spot problem. To avoid both of the above problems, this paper proposes two protocols: LEACHDistance and LEACHDistance-M. LEACHDistance is proposed for static wireless sensor networks where cluster heads are chosen based on the upper threshold distance, lower threshold distance, and remaining energy. LEACHDistance-M is proposed for mobile wireless sensor networks where the selection of cluster heads is based on the upper threshold distance, lower threshold distance, remaining energy, and least mobility. The simulation results show that the proposed protocols increase network lifetime, increase the number of packets received by the base station, are more energy efficient, and are also more scalable when evaluated with other existing routing protocols. © TÜBİTAK.","Base station; Cluster head; Mobile WSN; Sensor node; Wireless sensor networks","Base stations; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Cluster based wireless sensor networks; Cluster head; Mobile wireless sensor network; Mobile WSN; Multihop transmission; Remaining energies; Single hop transmission; Threshold distances; Wireless sensor networks","Khandnor, P.; PEC University of TechnologyIndia; email: padmavati@pec.ac.in",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017399583

Association rule mining (ARM) is one of the techniques in data processing with the two sub processes. One is identifying frequent itemsets and the other is association rule mining. Frequent itemset mining has developed as a major issue in data mining and assumes an essential part in various data mining tasks, for example, association analysis, classification, etc. In the structure of frequent itemset mining, the outcomes are itemsets which are frequent in the entire database. Association rule mining is a basic data mining task. Researchers developed many algorithms for finding frequent itemsets and association rules. However, relying upon the choice of the thresholds, present algorithms become very slow and produce a greatly large amount of outcomes or generates few outcomes, omitting usable information. Furthermore, it is well-known that an expansive extent of association rules produced is redundant. This is truly a significant issue because in practice users don’t have much asset for analyzing the outcomes and need to find a certain amount of outcomes within a limited time. To address this issue, we propose a one of a kind algorithm called top-k association rules (TKAR) to mine top positioned data from a data set. The proposed algorithm uses a novel technique for generating association rules. This algorithm is unique and best execution and characteristic of scalability, which will be a beneficial alternative to traditional association rule mining algorithms and where k is the number of rules user want to mine. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Association rules; Data mining (DM); Frequent itemset mining (FIM); K; Min_conf; Transactional database","Association rules; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Data handling; Intelligent computing; Potassium; Association analysis; Association rule minings (ARM); Data mining tasks; Frequent itemset mining; Min_conf; Novel techniques; Rule mining algorithms; Transactional database; Data mining","Gireesha, O.; Department of Information Technology, Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering CollegeIndia; email: gireesha93@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

However, a few sensor nodes die during the network operation due to energy constraints which may break the coverage of the target area. We refer this as a coverage hole problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called CHD-CR which attempts to restore the coverage after detecting a coverage hole in the target area. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of coverage hole detection (CHD) and coverage restoration (CR) phases. We design an efficient local mechanism for coverage hole detection and energy efficient technique for its restoration.

In the conventional dual SBM model, the data and the weights of input and output are found as crisp quantities. However, in real world applications, input-output data and input-output weights may have vague/uncertainty due to various factors such as quality of treatment and medicines, number of medical and non-medical staffs, number of patients, etc. in health sector. To deal with such uncertainty, we can apply fuzzy set theory. In this paper, we propose a SBM model with fuzzy weights in Fuzzy DEA (FDEA) for fuzzy input and fuzzy output. This model is then reduced to a crisp LPP by using expected values of a fuzzy number (FN). Finally, we present an application of the proposed model to the health sector, consisting of two input variables as (i) sum of number of doctors and staff nurses (ii) number of pharmacists and two output variables as (i) number of inpatients (ii) number of outpatients.

Ternary logic is an effective approach over the default binary logic design technique because it allows to define one more voltage level which is VDD/2 and it also allows a circuit to be simple in design and energy efficient due to its property of reduction in circuit overhead such as interconnects and chip area. A CMOS and CNTFET-based ternary logic gates and arithmetic circuit design has been proposed to implement and compare binary and ternary logic design based on CMOS and CNTFET. The main objective is to compare the CMOS and CNTFET results and verify the advantages of CNTFET technology. The proposed CNTFET technique combined with ternary logic provides an usable performance, improved speed and reduces propagation delay characteristics in circuit such as inverter and decoder. Simulation results of proposed designs using H-SPICE are observed and shown that the proposed ternary logic gates consume significant less delay than the CMOS gates implementations.

Each hospital h has a positive capacity denoting the number of residents that can be matched to h. The residents and the hospitals specify strict preferences over each other. This is the well-studied Hospital Residents (HR) problem which is a generaliza-tion of the Stable Marriage (SM) problem. The goal is to assign residents to hospitals optimally while respecting the capacities of the hospitals. Sta-bility is a well-accepted notion of optimality in such problems. However, motivated by the need for larger cardinality matchings, alternative notions of optimality like popularity have been investigated in the SM setting. In this paper, we consider a generalized HR setting – namely the Laminar Classified Stable Matchings (LCSM+) problem. Here, additionally, hospi-tals can specify classifications over residents in their preference lists and classes have upper quotas. We show the following new results: We define a notion of popularity and give a structural characterization of popular matchings for the LCSM+ problem. Assume n = |R| + |H| and m = |E|.

Since a major portion of energy is spent by the transceiver operations, transmission power control (TPC) in the medium access control (MAC) layer can bring about considerable energy ef ciency. Since TPC algorithms will have a direct impact on the received signal strength index (RSSI) at the receiver, RSSI is the primary input parameter for any TPC algorithm. The objective of the proposed work is to decide on the exact value of transmission power required for the next transmission that will ensure an RSSI just above the threshold level at the receiver. Since this involves estimation of RSSI for the next transmission, we propose three state estimation techniques, namely Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), and unscented KF (UKF) to predict the RSSI accurately. This predicted value is used as an input for an artificial neural network (ANN)-based TPC algorithm. The effectiveness of the estimation techniques is verified by the prediction error. The accuracy of prediction is reected in the TPC algorithm in terms of reduced power utilization. © 2017 TÜBITAK.","Kalman filter; Neural network controller; RSSI prediction; State estimation techniques; Transmission power control; Wireless sensor networks","Access control; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Kalman filters; Medium access control; Neural networks; Power control; Quality of service; Radio transceivers; Signal receivers; State estimation; Estimation techniques; Medium access control layer; Neural network controllers; Prediction errors; Received signal strength; Received signal strength indices (RSSI); Transmission power; Transmission power control; Wireless sensor networks","Sabitha, R.; Department of Instrumentation Engineering, MIT Campus, Anna UniversityIndia; email: sabitha.ramakrishnan@gmail.com",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010791274

We show that the schemes are insecure and we reason for their insecurity. Also, we provide a generic approach to make the schemes based on Chinese remainder theorem as secure against strong adversary.

Limitations, such as poor processing ability and limited battery life, make it difficult for mobile devices to process complex computational tasks. The mobile devices in traditional local processing find it difficult to execute high-bandwidth-consuming videos, and solve this problem by offloading complex executions of the application onto cloud computing to minimise the processing requirements and energy consumption of the mobile device, thereby overcoming the limitations of poor processing ability and limited battery life of said mobile device. The energy efficient framework focuses on mobile cloud computing (MCC), which employs computational offloading for computationally intensive mobile applications on the mobile devices. An input device, namely, a virtual network computing (VNC) client, is installed on the local mobile device and connected to the VNC server, which is installed in the cloud. Energy consumption of the selected application is reduced up to 67.19% by computational offloading compared to traditional methods.

Target coverage problem pertains to maximize the network lifetime while considering the resource scarcity. The paper proposes a hybrid scheduling protocol for target coverage for wireless sensor networks which determines the number of set covers for monitoring all the targets using the probabilistic coverage model, node contribution and trust values. The optimal observation probability is obtained for the parameter values of the sensing and communication characteristics of the nodes using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and probabilistic coverage model. The proposed protocol uses a node scheduling technique using Fuzzy Logic to activate the nodes to form the set covers. The proposed protocol is validated for a smaller network and is simulated for a real large network. The simulation results show that the performance of proposed protocol improves the network efficiency in terms of coverage, network lifetime and reliability in terms of trust factor.

Energy efficient key agreement schemes (KAS) that establish symmetric secrets are best suited for resource constraint devices of low cost Internet of Things (IoT), like sensors of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). There exists numerous elegant distributed KAS, either random or deterministic; however an adequate deterministic hierarchical proposal is absent till date. We propose a lightweight key agreement scheme (KAS) that achieves these desirable design criteria: supports a decentralized hierarchy of prefixed number of levels (l). Decentralization is necessary for large networks to delegate powers to lower level users and thereby reduce the burden of primal central authority; deterministic KPS implies nodes in our hierarchy has predictable key rings;our scheme is resilient against compromise of (i) any number of lower level users; and (ii) threshold number of same or higher level nodes in hierarchy;our scheme has predictable connectivity throughout the hierarchy which is a linear function of the system parameter n. In fact our subset based scheme is fully connected till depth 2 (root authority at depth 0). non-interactive: that saves bandwidth. Rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis exhibit that this first ever deterministic subset scheme (defined in [8]) outperforms related state-of-the-art protocols. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Connectivity; Hierarchy; Internet of Things (Low cost network-WSN); Key agreement; Non interactive; Resilience; Symmetric key cryptography","Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Connectivity; Hierarchy; Key agreement; Low costs; Non interactive; Resilience; Symmetric key cryptography; Network security","Sarkar, P.; School of Mathematical Science, National Institute of Science Education and ResearchIndia; email: pinakisark@gmail.com","Yan Z.Molva R.Mazurczyk W.Kantola R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319647005,,,"English","Lect.

In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneity-aware Energy-efficient Clustering (HEC) technique which considers two types of heterogeneity – network lifetime and of sensor nodes. Selection of cluster head nodes is done based on the three network lifetime phases: only advanced nodes are allowed to become cluster heads in the initial phase; in the second active phase all nodes are allowed to participate in cluster head selection process with equal probability, and in the last dying out phase, clustering is relaxed by allowing direct transmission. Simulation-based performance analysis of the proposed technique as compared to other relevant techniques shows that HEC achieves longer stable region, improved throughput, and better energy dissipation owing to judicious consumption of additional energy of advanced nodes. On an average, the improvement observed for stability period over LEACH, SEP, FAIR and HEC- with SEP protocols is around 65%, 30%, 15% and 17% respectively. Further, the scalability of proposed technique is tested by varying the field size and number of sensing nodes. The results obtained are found to be quite optimistic. The impact of energy heterogeneity has also been assessed and it is found to improve the stability period though only upto a certain extent. © 2017 KSII.","Clustering; Energy-efficient; Heterogeneity; Phases of network; Stability period; Wireless sensor network","Channel capacity; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-head nodes; Cluster-head selections; Clustering; Energy efficient; Energy Efficient clustering; Heterogeneity; Network stability; Performance analysis; Energy efficiency","Sharma, S.; IKG Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: sukhwinder.sharma@bbsbec.ac.in",,"Korean Society for Internet Information",19767277,,,,"English","KSII Trans.

In the proposed protocol called Cooperative relay-based TBF (CBTF), although every forwarder knows the next hop from the packet header, it does not transmit directly to its designated neighbor. Instead it lowers its transmission power so as to send the packet to some intermediate relay nodes, lying close to the trajectory, which, in turn, transmit concurrently the packet to the next forwarder. This forces cooperative relaying between two adjacent forwarders, which avoid direct communication between them. The paper shows analytically that the proposed relay-based method in CTBF is more energy-efficient than the direct forwarding used in TBF. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Cooperative communication; Energy efficiency; Power management (telecommunication); Relay control systems; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Cooperative relay; Cooperative relaying; Direct communications; Forwarding nodes; Trajectory based forwarding; Trajectory-based; Transmission power; Wireless broadcast; Wireless sensor networks","Saha, D.; Department of ECE, RCC Institute of Information Technology (RCCIIT)India","Mukherjee S.Bhattacharjee A.K.Deyasi A.Debnath P.","CRC Press/Balkema",,9781138029835,,,"English","Comput.

As compared with wired networks, the rate of random packet loss due to wireless channel errors or node mobility is very high in MANET. Misinterpretation of random packet loss as a loss due to congestion by TCP causes significant degradation in the performance (i.e. aggregate throughput) of the network. Numerous solutions are proposed in literature, but they either are cross layer solution or focused on specific issues of TCP. In order to improve the efficiency of TCP in dynamic mobile ad hoc network, we proposed a new energy efficient, end-to-end, layered, transport layer solution. The solution, referenced as 'Proposed-TCP', can identity packet loss due to congestion, wireless channel error and route failure, by using multiple end-to-end metrics. The solution can manage the incipient congestion in the network also. The solution is implemented and simulated in Network Simulator (NS2) for Gauss-Markov and Manhattan-Grid mobility models. The simulation results are collected carefully and compared with the results of TCP Reno, TCP Santa Cruz, and ADTCP. The simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms TCP Reno, TCP Santa Cruz, and ADTCP by producing better performance in terms of throughput and fairness. © 2017 IEEE.","Congestion Control; Layered solution; MANET; Network Simulator; TCP Reno","Congestion control (communication); Energy efficiency; Mobile telecommunication systems; Packet loss; Random errors; Transmission control protocol; Aggregate throughput; Common platform; MANET; Network simulators; Random packet loss; TCP reno; Transport layers; Wireless channel errors; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Users on entering the system gets randomly connected to one of the femtocell under its coverage. This leads to some femtocell being overloaded and some femtocells remaining underutilized. In this paper, a non-cooperative game is played between the users for deciding among the femtocells under its coverage which gives an optimum performance; without hampering the performance of other users. The critical selection is based on reaching Nash Equilibrium of the game with the help of the utility function.

Feedback from different stakeholders plays a crucial role here. From literature study, the need of textual feedback analysis for an academic institute is well established. In fact, it has been perceived that often a textual feedback is more informative, more open ended and more effective in producing actionable insights to decision makers as compared to more common score based (on a scale from 1: n) feedback. However, getting this information from textual feedback is not possible through the traditional means of data analysis. Here we have conceptualized a tool, which can apply text mining techniques to elicit insights from textual data and has been published as an open source package for a broader use by practitioners. Appropriate visualization techniques are applied for intuitive understanding of the insights. For this, we have used a real dataset consisting of alumni feedback from a top engineering college in Kolkata. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Sentiment analysis; Textual feedback; Topic models","Computation theory; Data mining; Decision making; Natural language processing systems; Academic institutes; Continuous improvements; Engineering colleges; Intuitive understanding; Sentiment analysis; Text mining techniques; Topic model; Visualization technique; Intelligent computing","Saha, U.; Institute of Engineering and ManagementIndia; email: urmisaha.88@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

With the introduction of smart grid and its energy optimization techniques, it is now possible to efficiently manage and control consumers’ energy usage to fulfil their demands with the existing energy generation infrastructure, which otherwise seems to be a backbreaking challenge. This paper presents an efficient energy management solution for buildings with a large number of thermostatic devices (air conditioners) that maintain the temperature of different thermal zones in a predefined range. The primary objective of this paper is to schedule the thermostatic devices in order to reduce total energy consumption by these devices when they are in operation for a very long duration of time, while maintaining the other constraints. We formulate it as a graph problem where minimum mean cycle will provide the desired solution. The proposed methodology ensures that at no point in time the power consumption goes beyond a certain peak power consumption limit. We also enhance the methodology to reduce peak load consumption. Furthermore, a fast greedy approach has been developed to efficiently scale up the aforementioned scheduling scheme for a large number of devices. Experimental results show that significant improvements can be obtained by the proposed approaches over existing algorithms in reducing average energy consumption. © 2017 IEEE.","Demand side management (DSM); Energy management; Minimum mean cycle; Smart grid; Thermostatic device scheduling","Air conditioning; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Scheduling; Device scheduling; Energy optimization; Industrial buildings; Intelligent scheduling; Minimum mean cycle; Scheduling schemes; Smart grid; Total energy consumption; Smart power grids","Chakraborty, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: nilotpal.pcs14@iitp.ac.in",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate an individual influence on others. The influence of a person X over person Y is defined as the ratio of Y’s investment that Y makes on X. Most contemporary networks return source–target paths in an online social network as a result of search ranked by degrees of separation. This approach fails to reflect tie of social strength (i.e., intimacy of two people in terms of interaction), and does not reflect asymmetric nature of social relations (i.e., if a person X invests time or effort in person Y, then the reverse is not necessarily true). In this paper, it is proved that in social graph result can prove to be more effective by incorporating the concept of directed and weighted influence edges taking into account both asymmetry and tie strength. The study is based on two real-world networks: Twitter capturing its retweet data and DBLP capturing its author–coauthor relationship.

As a result, at any point, it may leak the information. So, it is important to decide leakage threshold in any computing architecture. To prevent leakage more than the predefined threshold, quantitative analysis is helpful. This paper aims to provide a method to quantify information leakage in service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based Web services. Design/methodology/approach: To visualize the dynamic binding of SOA components, first, the orchestration of components is modeled. The modeling helps to information-theoretically quantify information leakage in SOA-based Web services. Then, the paper considers the non-interference policy in a global way to quantify information leakage. It considers not only variables which interfere with security sensitive content but also other architectural parameters to quantify leakage in Web services. To illustrate the attacker’s ability, a strong threat model has been proposed in the paper. Findings: The paper finds that information leakage can be quantified in SOA-based Web services by considering parameters that interfere with security sensitive content and information theory. A hypothetical case study scenario of flight ticket booking Web services has been considered in the present paper in which leakage of 18.89 per cent information is calculated.

Long distance transmission is very expensive in WSNs since power consumption is proportional to dα for transmitting over distance d, where α is path loss exponent in the interval [2:6]. Thus, there is a necessary requirement of relay nodes in the network that are capable of performing data sensing, data aggregation and data routing, as described in various patents. Method: This paper presents a Layered Relay-Medium Access Control (LR-MAC) Protocol for a Personal Area Network. This protocol introduces the concept of multi-layering for the relay (routing) nodes. The protocol is validated by doing extensive simulations in QualNet 6.1 network simulator. The QoS parameters are analyzed for three different deployment strategies viz. random, grid and circular. Results: The results show that LR-MAC Protocol is an efficient technique in terms of improving network lifetime, average throughput and reducing number of packets dropped due to channel access failure in the network; while LR-MAC gives a neutral performance in terms of end-to-end delay in the network. Conclusion: LR-MAC protocol can efficiently work for random deployments as well as for well-planned effective deployments like in smart building monitoring. The network can also be modified for large areas by increasing number of deployed sensor nodes and keeping node density constant. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","Energy efficiency; Energy hole; LR-MAC; Multi-layering; QoS parameters; Relay/routing node; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Personal communication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Deployment strategy; Energy holes; Extensive simulations; Long distance transmission; Multilayering; QoS parameters; Relay/routing node; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Medium access control","Thalore, R.; Department of ECE, College of Engineering and Technology, Mody University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: ranjanathalore.cet@modyuniversity.ac.in",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",22132759,,,,"English","Recent Pat.

In practical applications, computational techniques have given best results and the research in this field is continuously growing. The purpose of this paper is to search for a general and effective intelligent tool for prediction of patient survival after surgery. The present study involves the construction of such intelligent computational models using different configurations, including data partitioning techniques that have been experimentally evaluated by applying them over realistic medical data set for the prediction of survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of the experiments and research performed over the data belonging to various fields using different intelligent tools, the authors infer that combining or integrating the qualification aspects of fuzzy inference system and quantification aspects of artificial neural network can prove an efficient and better model for prediction. The authors have constructed three soft computing-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models with different configurations and data partitioning techniques with an aim to search capable predictive tools that could deal with nonlinear and complex data. After evaluating the models over three shuffles of data (training set, test set and full set), the performances were compared in order to find the best design for prediction of patient survival after surgery. The construction and implementation of models have been performed using MATLAB simulator. Findings: On applying the hybrid intelligent neuro-fuzzy models with different configurations, the authors were able to find its advantage in predicting the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. Experimental results and comparison between the constructed models conclude that ANFIS with Fuzzy C-means (FCM) partitioning model provides better accuracy in predicting the class with lowest mean square error (MSE) value. Apart from MSE value, other evaluation measure values for FCM partitioning prove to be better than the rest of the models. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the model can be applied to other biomedicine and engineering fields dealing with different complex issues related to imprecision and uncertainty. Originality/value: The originality of paper includes framework showing two-way flow for fuzzy system construction which is further used by the authors in designing the three simulation models with different configurations, including the partitioning methods for prediction of patient survival after surgery. Several experiments were carried out using different shuffles of data to validate the parameters of the model. The performances of the models were compared using various evaluation measures such as MSE. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Artificial neural network (ANN); Fuzzy inference system (FIS); Fuzzy logic; Soft computing","Artificial intelligence; C (programming language); Complex networks; Computation theory; Data handling; Diseases; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; MATLAB; Mean square error; Neural networks; Search engines; Soft computing; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Tracking (position); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Computational technique; Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy inference systems; Intelligent computational model; Nonlinear fuzzy systems; Partitioning methods; Structure identification; Fuzzy inference","Khan, S.S.; Department of Computer Science, University of KashmirIndia; email: shabiakhan@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1756378X,,,,"English","Int.

The major factor behind the energy consumption inWSN is its data collectionmechanism.The direct data transmission fromeach sensor node to the Base Station (BS) consumes more energy than other alternatives. Also it is unnecessary, due to redundant data transmission because of geographically closer nodes. Clustering is the best data collection architectural model for WSN since it takes care of in-network processing which handles redundant data within the network.The techniques used for the network having uniform node distribution are not suitable for the networks which have nonuniformly distributed nodes. This paper contributes a novel clustering algorithm: Fuzzy Logic Based Energy Efficient Clustering Hierarchy (FLECH) for nonuniformWSN. The clusters in FLECH are created using proper parameters which increases the lifetime of the WSN. Fuzzy logic in FLECH is wisely used to combine important parameters like residual energy, node centrality, and distance to BS for electing best suitable nodes as CH and increases the network lifetime.

A pattern is temporally similar when it satisfies subset constraints. The naive and apriori algorithm designed for non-temporal databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns from temporal databases. The brute force approach requires computing 2ntrue support combinations for ‘n’ items from finite item set and falls in NP-class. The apriori or fp-tree based approaches are not directly extendable to temporal databases to obtain similar temporal patterns. In this present research, we come up with novel approach to discover temporal association patterns which are similar for pre-specified subset constraints, and substantially reduce support computations by defining expressions to estimate support bounds. The proposed approach eliminates computational overhead in finding similar temporal patterns. The results prove that the proposed method outperforms brute force approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Monotonicity; Outliers; Prevalence; Similar; Temporal association pattern","Bayesian networks; Database systems; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Image processing; Robot programming; Soft computing; Swarm intelligence; Monotonicity; Outliers; Prevalence; Similar; Temporal association; Computation theory","Radhakrishna, V.; VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: radhakrishna_v@vnrvjiet.in","Matousek R.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9783319580876,,,"English","Adv.

Resources voluntarily become available in the grid, as a result of which, this collaborative computing becomes more cost effective than traditional HPC. In the grid, since, the participating resources are of varying capabilities, load balancing becomes an essential requirement. This workload distribution mechanism among available resources aims to minimize makespan, optimize resource usage, and prevent overloading of any resource. Eventually, the resources need to be prioritized based on their capability and demand in the current scenario. Thus, prioritization of resources balances workload in grid. In the proposed workload scheduling algorithm, nearest deadline first-scheduled (NDFS), resource ranking, and subsequent job scheduling maintains balanced load across the grid. The ranking of resources in computational grid is achieved using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model. The primary objective of this paper is to optimize the workload of grid environment while executing multiple jobs ensuring maximum resource utilization within minimum execution time. Service quality agreement (SQA) is met through proper scheduling of jobs among ranked resources. The grid test bed environment is set up with the help of Globus toolkit 5.2.

The RS provides either services or products to the users based on their preferences. An Online Social Network (OSN) enables the users to share information with their social neighbors. An OS furnishes the products to the customers or users based on their requirements. The conventional context-aware recommender systems are inept at predicting the new user’s preferences, and user’s recent preferences. Usually, customers like to drift their preferences over time due to the evolution of the products in the OS. Hence, together considering of the key parameters of social popularity and temporal dynamics is crucial for modeling the RS. This paper presents Social and Temporal-Aware personalized Recommendation for the best Spreaders (STARS) approach which recommends the products based on the social influence and recent context information about the user. It employs the collaborative filtering and incorporates the three phases such as influence user identification using OSN, user’s preference identification using OS, and recent preference based recommendation using temporal dynamics. Initially, the STARS identifies the best spreader in OSN by applying Eigen Vector Centrality (EVC) measurement in the k-shell structure. Secondly, it analyzes the customer’s explicit as well as implicit feedback information using a user-item matrix factorization and Pearson correlation measurement. Finally, the STARS recommends the appropriate products to the users by predicting the user’s recent preferences reading it from the context-aware explicit and implicit feedback information. The experimental results show that the STARS significantly outperform the conventional context-aware recommender systems. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Centrality; Context-aware; Explicit; Implicit; Recommendation; Social influence; User-item matrix; User’s preference","Collaborative filtering; Computation theory; Correlation methods; Factorization; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Intelligent computing; Matrix algebra; Recommender systems; Sales; Social networking (online); Spreaders; Stars; Websites; Centrality; Context-Aware; Explicit; Implicit; Recommendation; Social influence; User-item matrix; Economic and social effects","Sheshasaayee, A.; Department of Computer Science, Quaid-e-Millath Government College for Women (Autonomous)India; email: ananthi.research@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

It is clearly evident that TFET buffers exhibit improved speed of operation and high energy efficiency over FinFET buffers for scaled supply voltages, demonstrating suitability for applications such as Internet of things (IoT) SoCs.

Generalizing these issues is tedious over different applications. In this paper, the real time issues such as tilt or rotation variation and few samples problem for face recognition are addressed and proposed an efficient method. In preprocessing, an edge detection method using Robert`s operator is utilized to identify facial borders for cropping purpose. The query images are axially tilted for different degrees of rotation. Both database and test images are segmented into one hundred fragments of 5 * 5 size each. Four different matrix characteristics are derived for each divided part of the image. Corresponding attributes are added to yield features related to final matrix. Final one hundred facial attributes are obtained by fusing diagonal features with one hundred features of matrix. Euclidean distance between the final attributes of gallery and query images is computed. The results on Yale dataset has superior performance compared to the existing different approaches and it is convincing over the dataset created. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cropping; Matrix norm; Tilt invariance","Computation theory; Edge detection; Intelligent computing; Matrix algebra; Query processing; Cropping; Diagonal features; Edge detection methods; Euclidean distance; Human faces; Matrix norms; Query images; Real-time face recognition; Face recognition","Jagadeesh, H.S.; ECE Department, Rayalaseema UniversityIndia; email: jagadeesh.11@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

Moreover, this growth extends the capacity of various resources of the datacenters. As a circumstance, the amount of carbon footprints generated from the datacenters is sharply increased. Therefore, the objective is to use the datacenter’s resources proficiently without compromising the user requirements such that energy consumption is minimized. The recent studies have shown that the user requirements are provided in the form of virtual machines (VMs) which are deployed in the physical machines (PMs) of the datacenters based on the resource utilization or decreasing order of the VM capacity. However, these studies have not considered the capacity of the user requests. In this paper, we propose a request-based VM placement (RVMP) algorithm by considering the capacity of the requests. The proposed algorithm assigns the user requests to the VMs and further assigns the used VMs to the PMs based on the capacity of the requests and VMs respectively. Our simulation results on five different datasets, which are generated using Monte Carlo method, show that RVMP improves performance in terms of the number of used VMs and PMs, average PM utilization and energy consumption of PMs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cloud computing; Datacenter; Energy consumption; Physical machine; Request; Resource utilization; Virtual machine placement","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Java programming language; Monte Carlo methods; Network security; Datacenter; Explosive growth; Request; Resource utilizations; State-of-the-art algorithms; User requirements; Virtual machine placements; Virtual machines; Cloud computing","Panda, S.K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering and Information Technology, Veer Surendra Sai University of TechnologyIndia; email: sanjayauce@gmail.com","Krishna P.R.Krishnan P.Parida L.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319504711,,,"English","Lect.

The energy efficient cluster-based protocols play a vital role for energy saving in hierarchical WSN. In modelling, probability plays its important role.

Most of the protocols consider probability of all the nodes to become CH at the beginning of the network is fixed but the present paper is an approach to consider varying probability of the nodes to become CH at the beginning on the basis of distance from BS.

The year of 2006 witnessed the emergence of Compressed Sensing algorithm which was later used to spearhead research in umixing problems. Later, the notion of lp norms 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 and other non-smooth and non-convex penalty function were used in place of the traditional convex l1 penalty. Dealing with optimization problems with non-convex objective function is rather difficult as most methodologies often get stuck at local optima. In this paper, a parameterised non-convex penalty function is used to induce sparsity in the unknown.The parameters of penalty function can be adjusted so as to make the objective function convex, thus resulting in the possibility of finding a global optimal solution. Here ADMM algorithm is utilized to arrive at the final iterative algorithm for the unmixing problem. The algorithm is tested on synthetic data set, generated from the spectral library provided by US geological survey. Different parametric penalty functions like log and arctan are used in the algorithm and is compared with the traditional l1 penalties, in terms of the performance measures RSNR and PoS. It was observed that the non-convex penalty functions out-performs the l1 penalty in terms of the aforementioned measures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","ADMM; Linear model; Parameterised non-convex penalties; Unmixing","Computation theory; Intelligent computing; Iterative methods; Optimization; Parameterization; ADMM; Global optimal solutions; Hyperspectral unmixing; Linear modeling; Non-convex objective functions; Optimization problems; Parameterised non-convex penalties; Unmixing; Parameter estimation","Harikumar, K.; Amrita School of Engineering, Centre for Computational Engineering and Networking (CEN)India; email: hari.kumar748@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

For eliminating such problems, a novel node disjoint multipath routing protocol called link reliable energy efficient AOMDV (LR-EE-AOMDV) routing protocol, the extension of AOMDV is proposed. The LR-EE-AOMDV finds multiple link reliable energy efficient paths between any source and destination pair for data transmission using three metrics such as path length, path-link quality estimator (P-LQE) and a novel path-node energy estimator (P-NEE).

In this paper, weighted centroid localization algorithm using teaching learning based optimization (WCL-TLBO) is proposed to improve the positioning accuracy in 3D space of WSN. In range-free algorithms, only received signal strength (RSS) information between nodes is sufficient to determine the position of target nodes. RSS value gives the clue to find out the distance between sensor nodes but shows non-linearity between RSS and distance. To overcome this non-linearity, fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used. Edge weights of WCL are modelled using FLS. Further to reduce the errors, TLBO is applied to optimize these edge weights.

With the application of Computational Intelligence (CI) based approaches, various metaheuristics have been developed for energy-efficient clustering in WSNs. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one such metaheuristic which arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs due to its ease of implementation and adaptive nature. However, its solution search equation, which is poor at exploitation process, contributes to its insufficiency. Thus, we present an improved Artificial Bee Colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve its exploitation capabilities. Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student's-t distribution. The proposed metaheuristic maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Student's-t distribution makes it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering protocol BeeCluster based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherits the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads (CHs) and improves energy-efficiency in WSNs. Simulation results show that the proposed clustering protocol outperforms other well known protocols on the basis of packet delivery, throughput, energy consumption, network lifetime and latency as performance metric. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy-efficient clustering; Improved Artificial Bee Colony (iABC) metaheuristic.; Wireless sensor networks","Artificial intelligence; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Optimization; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Energy Efficient clustering; Exploration and exploitation; Metaheuristic; Optimization problems; Student's t distribution; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Energy efficiency","Mann, P.S.; IKG Punjab Technical UniversityIndia; email: psmaan@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09521976,,EAAIE,,"English","Eng Appl Artif Intell",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994709385

The OSI Layer 2 and Layer 3 communication technologies of the WSN are the important aspects in communication and networking research. The protocols and standards of WSN in different layers are already well defined. In this article, we evaluate the Layer 2 mechanisms which meet the special demands of WSNs for resource constrained applications. Large number of WSN devices need to be deployed in a typical environmental monitoring use cases. In this work we consider a use case of sensors and actuators in a small geographical region. For this a short range communication technology such as IEEE 802.15.4 is considered. Various type of sensors are deployed in the same region, in this cases effective MAC mechanism is required to effectively allocate the channel resource among these devices. The main concentration of this article is about the energy consumption of WSN devices. As the devices and network is resource constrained, energy efficient hardware’s, communication networking protocols and suitable software implementations are required. As far as the energy efficient protocols are considered MAC mechanisms is one of the very important processes, where suitable energy efficient mechanisms need to be selected. In the recent literatures showed that Contiki MAC is one of the suitable MAC layer implementation with dedicated Radio Duty Cycling Layer (RDC) which conserves the WSN nodes battery power.

Here, our analysis presents the identification of zebra in their natural habitat. All the techniques are tested on 824 Plains zebra images captured at Ol’Pejeta conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya. We have used coat strips as a biometric identifier which is unique in nature. To improve the performance of identification, information fusion of coat strips can be taken place from many points in zebra skin such as near legs, stomach and neck. Here two region near stomach (flake) and first limb (leg) is cropped from the textural pattern of strips of zebra is used in feature extraction. GMF, AAD, mean, and eigenface feature extraction methods are applied on flake and limb ROI of zebra. Then a novel image enhancement method: difference subplane adaptive histogram equalization is applied to improve the identification rate. Our technique is based on information fusion in fusing the score from stomach (flake) and first limb (leg) region. For this, sum, product, frank T-norm, and Hamacher T-norm rules are applied to validate the identification results.

In this context, we are proposing an opportunistic resource-pooling scheme that uses a cognitive computing model to accumulate the resources with faster resource convergence rate, reliability, and lower latency.

Redesigning of these shifter circuits using reversible logic approach leads to the generation of low power loss digital devices. Reversible logic approach works on the concept of removing heat generating entities from the digital designs. Nanotechnology, optical computing, low power CMOS design, quantum computing etc. are some of the major areas of application for reversible design approach. Here in this paper, we propose two design approaches for the reversible realisation of eight bit binary shifter circuit with improved performance parameters as compared to the existing designs. Comparison of designs are performed on some selected parameters such as total number of reversible logic gates used in the design and total garbage outputs generated. The proposed optimised design is simulated using ModelSim software and synthesised for Xilinx Spartan 3E with Device XC3S500E with 200 MHz frequency.

Till now, there is no standardized, exhaustive, and dynamic stop word list created for documents written in Indian Gujarati language which is spoken by nearly 66 million people worldwide. Most of the existing stop words removal approaches are file or dictionary based, wherein a hard-coded static, nonstandardized, and individually created list of stop words is used. The existing approaches are time consuming and complex owing to file or dictionary preparation by collecting possible stop words from a large vocabulary, complex framework and a morphologically variant Gujarati document. Even the other proposed approaches in the literature are also very restricted due to their dependence on word-length, word-frequency, and/or training data set. For the first time in scientific community worldwide, this paper proposes a dynamic approach independent of all factors namely usage of file or dictionary, word-length, word-frequency, and training dataset. An 11 rule-based approach is presented focusing on automatic and dynamic identification of a complete list of Gujarati stop words. Extensive empirical evidence has been presented through deployment of proposed algorithm on nearly 600 Gujarati documents, categorized into routine and domain-specific categories. The respective results with 98.10 and 94.08% average accuracy show that the proposed approach is effective and promising enough for implementation in NLP tasks involving Gujarati written documents. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Gujarati; Natural language processing (NLP); Rule-based approach; Stop word","Computation theory; Data mining; Intelligent computing; Linguistics; Dynamic approaches; Dynamic identification; Gujarati; NAtural language processing; Rule-based approach; Scientific community; Stop word; Training data sets; Natural language processing systems","Rakholia, R.M.; School of Computer Science, R K UniversityIndia; email: rajnish.rakholia@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

These are much more general than the basic rough sets and also the rough sets defined on proximity relations. However, some of the results established in this direction by De et al. have been found to be faulty.

The pattern generator comprises of a pseudorandom pattern generation unit, a toggle generation and control unit, a hold register unit. Preselected toggling (PRESTO) generator allows user defined levels of toggling. The pattern generator is a linear finite state machine which drives a phase shifter, which reduces correlation of patterns. This paper proposes a test compression method which elevates the compression efficiency that has not been obtained by conventional compression techniques. It does not need any core logic modifications like test point insertion and thus the compression technique is nonintrusive.

Out of several factors responsible for huge power drainage the branch prediction unit of a processor contributes almost 10% of the overall power dissipation. This work aims to analyse the impact of inaccurate/faulty design on the branch predictors’ power dissipation while realising speculative execution. The issue has been addressed through introduction of probable faults in a predictor that lead to mis-speculation. The prediction mechanism in CMPs also plays a role in dead-block identification, that is to avoid unutilised power consumption in a system as well as to overcome the poor cache efficiency. The performance loss of a system due to design inaccuracies/faults in dead-block prediction is also evaluated. The detail analysis reveals that the design inaccuracies of a predictor can cause a huge power loss, even up to 95%. The additional power loss in a processor can effectively be sensed to enable diagnosis of the faulty module (design inaccuracies) of predictor as well as to frame guidelines for operating mode of a CMP’s cache system.

Electromyography techniques can be employed with the diagnosis of muscular nerve compression and expansion abnormalities and other problems of muscles and nervous systems. An electromyogram (EMG) signal detects the electrical potential activities generated by muscle cells. These cells are activated by electrochemical signals and neurological signals. It is so difficult for the neurophysiologist to distinguish the individual waveforms generated from the muscle. Thus, the classification and feature extraction of the EMG signal becomes highly necessary. The principle of independent component analysis (ICA), fast Fourier transform (FFT) and other methods is used as dimensionality reduction methods of different critical signals extracted from human body. These different existing techniques for analysis of EMG signals have several limitations such as lower recognition rate waveforms, sensitive to continuous training and poor accuracy. In this chapter, the EMG signals are trained using soft computing techniques like adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). ANFIS is the hybrid network where fuzzy logic principle is used in neural network. This proposed technique has different advantages for better training of the EMG signals using ANFIS network with a higher reliability and better accuracy.

The proposed approach integrates RGB intensity as fuzzified input variables, temperature as defuzzified output variables and fuzzy inference rules based Mamdani models. Based on the color characteristics of burning flame, temperature of different flame zones are located using a fuzzy logic controller. The temperature level at hotspot area is the highest and through the fuzzy analysis we were able to identify hotspot area from the flame image. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, quantitative metric such as f-measure has been used and it was found that the f-measure metric yields high accuracy for the hotspot area.

In an attempt to define a right notion of space complexity for the BSS model, Naurois [CiE 2007] introduced the notion of weak-space. We investigate the weak-space bounded computations and their plausible relationship with the classical space bounded computations. For weak-space bounded, division-free computations over BSS machines over complex numbers with =? 0 tests, we show the following: 1. The Boolean part of the weak log-space class is contained in deterministic log-space, i.e., BP(LOGSPACEW) ⊆ DLOG; 2. There is a set (formula presented) that cannot be decided by any deterministic BSS machine whose weak-space is bounded above by a polynomial in the input length, i.e., (formula presented). The second result above resolves the first part of Conjecture 1 stated in [6] over complex numbers and exhibits a limitation of weak-space. The proof is based on the structural properties of the semi-algebraic sets contained in PSPACEW and the result that any polynomial divisible by a degree-ω(1) elementary symmetric polynomial cannot be sparse. The lower bound on the sparsity is proved via an argument involving Newton polytopes of polynomials and bounds on number of vertices of these polytopes, which might be of an independent interest. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017.",,"Algebra; Computation theory; Topology; Algebraic computations; Bounded computation; Complex number; Elementary symmetric polynomial; Input lengths; Newton polytopes; Semi-algebraic sets; Space complexity; Polynomials","Joglekar, P.S.; Vishwakarma Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: joglekar.pushkar@gmail.com","Zeitoun M.Klasing R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783662557501,,,"English","Lect.

Due to limited amount of energy in sensors, the network seeks to attain energy efficient routing for prolonging their lifetime. Existing grid based routing protocols reduce the energy dissipation at nodes, however they suffer from congestion. Network congestion may lead to excessive energy consumption, which in turn minimizes the lifetime of network. In this paper, we propose a new Congestion Aware Lifetime Improving Routing Protocol (abbreviated shortly as CALIRP) for grid-based WSNs, which improves the network lifetime by minimizing congestion at nodes. In CALIRP, routing is conducted in a grid by grid manner through the cell-headers. To save the energy and avoid congestion, multiple routing paths are established from the source to the base station. The paths are selected based on Transmitting Factor (TF) of cell-headers which take queue occupancy, queue length and residual energy into account. In addition, CALIRP adjusts node's transmitting factor for reconstructing the paths so that the lifetime of network is prolonged. Simulation results highlight that the proposed CALIRP outperforms other existing routing algorithms in terms of success rate, queue occupancy and number of alive nodes etc. © 2017-IOS.","Adjacent cell; Cell-header; Congestion; Grid length; Grid-based sensor network; Multipath routing; Neighboring cell; Network lifetime; Transmitting factor","Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Queueing theory; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Congestion; Grid length; Grid-based; Multi path routing; Network lifetime; Transmitting factor; Wireless sensor networks","Bhattacharjee, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: sanghita.b@gmail.com",,"IOS Press",09266801,,JHSNE,,"English","J High Speed Networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010972105

Reputation management gives a chance to nodes to transmit data on secure and reliable routes.

It is of excessive cost to substitute exhausted batteries which is not even possible in antagonistic situations. Multiprocessors are used in WSNs for high performance scientific computing, where each processor is assigned the same or different workload. When the computational demands of the system increase then the energy efficient approaches play an important role to increase system lifetime. Energy efficiency is commonly carried out by using proportionate fair scheduler. This introduces abnormal overloading effect. In order to overcome the existing problems E-token Energy-Aware Proportionate Sharing (EEAPS) scheduling is proposed here. The power consumption for each thread/task is calculated and the tasks are allotted to the multiple processors through the auctioning mechanism. The algorithm is simulated by using the real-time simulator (RTSIM) and the results are tested. © 2017 Pasupuleti Ramesh and Uppu Ramachandraiah.",,"Multiprocessing systems; Power management; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Computational demands; Energy-constrained; Environmental Monitoring; High performance scientific computing; Multi processor systems; Multiple processors; Real time simulators; Surveillance systems; Energy efficiency","Ramachandraiah, U.; Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Hindustan UniversityIndia; email: uppur@hindustanuniv.ac.in",,"Hindawi Limited",15308669,,,,"English","Wireless Commun.

Several techniques have been developed to extend the lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks. Cluster head election has to be performed periodically in order to handle energy balance for facilitating reliable packet delivery. To achieve this an improved intelligent Ant colony optimization algorithm that eliminates the concept of stagnation in identifying the optimal paths through which the packets are routed from the source to the destination is proposed in this paper. In this improved intelligent Ant colony optimization algorithm, the updating rules for routing with the principle of adaptive adjustment strategy are used for identifying the reliable path. The dynamic strategy is used in this routing mechanism to achieve the better balance between the energy efficiency and packet forwarding potential. The movement rules of the packets are modified such that it gets enhanced to make it adaptable for optimizing the path and for improving energy efficiency. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Energy demand forecasting is a very important task in the electric power distribution system to enable appropriate planning for future power generation. Quantitative and qualitative methods have been utilized previously for the electricity demand forecasting. Due to the limitations in the availability of data, these methods fail to provide effective results. With the development of the advanced tools, these methods are replaced by efficient forecasting techniques. This paper presents the computational modeling of electricity consumption based on the Neural Network (NN) training algorithms. The main aim of the work is to determine the optimal training algorithm for electricity demand forecasting. From the experimental analysis, it is concluded that the Bayesian regularization training algorithm exhibits low relative error and high correlation coefficient than other training algorithms. Thus, the Bayesian Regularization training algorithm is selected as the optimal training algorithm for the effective prediction of the electricity demand. Finally, the economic input attributes are forecasted for next 15 years using time series forecasting. Using this forecasted economic attributes and with the optimal Bayesian Regularization training algorithm, the electricity demand for the next 15 years is predicted. The comparative analysis of the NN training algorithms for the proposed dataset and larger datasets obtained from the UCI repository and American Statistical Association shows that the Bayesian Regularization training algorithm yields higher correlation value and lower relative error than other training algorithms. © 2017 CTU FTS.","Activation functions; Bayesian regularization training algorithm; Electricity demand forecasting; Neural network model; Neural network training algorithms; Time series forecasting","Computation theory; Electric power distribution; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series; Activation functions; Electricity demand forecasting; Neural network model; Neural network training; Time series forecasting; Training algorithms; Electric power system planning","Usha, T.M.; Information and Communication Engineering, Anna UniversityIndia; email: ashariniharish@yahoo.co.in",,"Institute of Computer Science",12100552,,NNWOF,,"English","Neural Network World",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020164334

In some specific situations, the sensor field (target) may have coverage gaps due to the random deployment of sensors; hence, the optimized level of target coverage cannot be obtained. Given a set of sensors in the plane, the target coverage problem is to separate the sensor into different groups and provide them specific time intervals, so that the coverage lifetime can be maximized. Here, the constraint is that the network should be connected. Presently, target coverage problem is widely studied due to its lot of practical application in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This paper focuses on target coverage problem along with the minimum energy usage of the network so that the lifetime of the whole network can be increased. Since constructing a minimum connected target coverage problem is known to be NP-Complete, so several heuristics, as well as approximation algorithms, have been proposed. Here, we propose a heuristic for connected target coverage problem in WSN. We compare the performance of our heuristic with the existing heuristic, which states that our algorithm performs better than the existing algorithm for connected target coverage problem. Again, we have implemented the 2-connected target coverage properties for the network which provide fault tolerance as well as robustness to the network. So, we propose one algorithm which gives the target coverage along with 2-connectivity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Minimum spanning tree; Target coverage; Topology control; Wireless sensor Networks","Approximation algorithms; Energy efficiency; Fault tolerance; Optimization; Energy efficient; Minimum spanning trees; Optimized level; Random deployment; Sensor network applications; Target coverage; Target coverage problems; Topology control; Wireless sensor networks","Bhatta, B.K.; Indian Institute of Technology DelhiIndia; email: bijaya@maths.iitd.ac.in","Murgante B.Apduhan B.O.Borruso G.Cuzzocrea A.Torre C.M.Gervasi O.Taniar D.Stankova E.Rocha A.M.A.C.Misra S.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319624068,,,"English","Lect.

The existing energy based CH selection mechanisms consider that all the participating sensors are trustworthy. Conversely, the trust-based CH selection schemes assume that the sensor nodes are energy efficient. But, these assumptions of energy factor or trust assessment made by the CH selection mechanisms may not be true and the Residual Energy (RE) of the sensors may not be the sole factor to identify an effective CH in a WSN. Hence, this paper presents hybrid integrated energy and trust assessment based forecasting model known as Hyper-geometric Energy Factor based Semi-Markov Prediction Mechanism (HEFSPM) for effective CH election so as to improve the lifetime of the network. From the simulation results, it is inferred that HEFSPM is superior in improving the lifetime of the network to a maximum extent of 22 than the existing CH election mechanisms considered for investigation. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

There are different methods for the elicitation of software requirements like traditional methods, group elicitation methods, goal oriented methods, etc. Among these methods, goal oriented methods have received much recognition by software requirements engineering community. On the basis of our literature review, we identify that “goal oriented requirements elicitation processes do not support how to select and prioritize the requirements using analytic hierarchy process on the basis of the cost and effort criteria”. Therefore, in-order to address this issue, we proposed a method, i.e. GOASREP, for the elicitation of software requirements using “goal oriented approach” and the prioritization of the elicited requirements using “analytic hierarchy process”. In the proposed method, we used function point analysis approach for the estimation of the cost of each requirement. COCOMO model has been applied to estimate the effort of each requirement. Finally, the usage of the GOASREP is explained using Institute Examination System. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Analytic hierarchy process; COCOMO model; Function point analysis; Goal oriented requirements elicitation process; Requirements elicitation","Analytic hierarchy process; Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Intelligent computing; COCOMO model; Elicitation methods; Engineering community; Examination system; Function point analysis; Goal-oriented approach; Requirements elicitation; Software requirements; Requirements engineering","Sadiq, M.; Computer Engineering Section, UPFET, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University)India; email: msadiq@jmi.ac.in","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

For efficient detection of Android malwares, different static and dynamic malware detection methods have been proposed. One of the popular methods of static detection technique is permission/feature-based detection of malwares through AndroidManifest.xml file using machine learning classifiers. But ignoring important feature or keeping irrelevant features may specifically cause mystification for classification algorithms. So to reduce classification time and improvement of accuracy different feature reduction tools have been used in different literature. In this work, we have proposed a framework that extracts the permission features of manifest files, generates feature vectors and uses six different feature ranking tools to create separate feature reducts. On those feature reducts different machine learning classifiers of Data Mining Tool, Weka have been used to classify android applications. We have evaluated our method on a set of total 734 applications (504 benign, 231 malwares) and results show that highest TPR rate observed is 98.01% while accuracy is up to 87.99% and highest F1 score is 0.9189. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Android; Classification; Feature ranking; Feature reduction; Malwares; Static detection","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Computer crime; Data mining; Feature extraction; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Malware; Smartphones; Android; Feature ranking; Feature reduction; Malwares; Static detections; Android (operating system)","Bhattacharya, A.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Institute of Engineering & ManagementIndia; email: abhishek.bhattacharya@iemcal.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

An adaptive and hybrid routing algorithm for simultaneous data aggregation and exploitation of the data correlation between nodes using a binary search tree framework is proposed. Routes are chosen to minimise the total energy expended by the network based on the shortest response time to the broadcasting request. In this work, a highly secure asymmetric key cryptography algorithm is developed to provide secure data aggregation among the network.

Commutation in the conventional DC motors is carried out by commutator which is rotating part placed on the rotor and brushes. Due to these mechanical parts, conventional DC motor consist high amount of losses. Brushless DC (BLDC) Motors are very extensively used motors these days because of its advantages over conventional DC motors. Commutation is carried out with the help of solid-state switches in BLDC motor instead of mechanical commutator as in conventional DC motor. This improves the performance of the motor. BLDC motor draws non-linear currents from the source affecting the loads connected at the source point due to harmonic production. This harmonic production reduces the system efficiency and mainly stresses the loads connected at source point. BLDC drive system with power factor (PF) correction was discussed in this paper. BLDC with normal AC-DC diode bridge rectifier and the performance of BLDC drive with PWM rectifier for power factor correction was discussed. BLDC drive system with PWM rectifier for power factor correction was validated by considering different cases.

Some of the applications of this outlier detection are: network intrusion detection, fraud detection, database cleaning, etc.; In most situations, there is scarcity of abnormal data where as plenty of normal data is available. This is the biggest challenge of novelty detection. The characteristics of abnormal or outlier data are often unknown beforehand. Density estimation methods can be used for novelty detection tasks. These methods work only when the assumed data distribution is same as the underlying data distribution which may not be known in advance. C-SVDD and ν-SVDD are used for novelty detection tasks in our experiments. Experiments are performed on a toy data set of bivariate and overlapping classes and real-time multivariate data. Different kernels are also used for experimental studies. All experiments shows that RBF (Gaussian) kernel gives better performance than the other types of kernels.

Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) is an advanced form of WSN with node mobility which is highly useful in several real time applications. Energy efficiency is the major challenge while designing MWSN. Clustering is one of the important energy efficient techniques to effectively utilize the available resources and also node mobility relieves hotspots problem. Clustering is the process of grouping the nodes into clusters. A cluster consists of a Cluster Head (CH) and number of cluster members. CH is responsible for collecting data from cluster members, aggregating it and forwarding the aggregated data to Base Station (BS). So, CH selection plays a vital role to preserve energy in MWSN. As CH selection influences the overall performance of the MWSN, many researchers are carried out to select the proper CHs. In this paper, a dynamic CH selection using Fuzzy logic is proposed. The fuzzy input parameters are residual energy, distance to BS and node mobility. The output parameter is the probability of becoming CH. The proposed method is compared to the well known clustering protocol LEACH. Simulation results shows that the proposed method produces better results than LEACH interms of energy consumption and network lifetime. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Bokaro Steel Limited have slab caster and during continuous casting, one of the major operational irregularities encountered is breakout. A breakout is a hazard whereby the thin shell of the strand breaks, allowing the still-molten metal inside the strand to leak out from the mould, thus necessitating an expensive machine shutdown. Hence the breakout has a profound influence on the caster availability; affecting the productivity, cost of production, damage of machinery, safety hazards, etc. Breakouts occur due to the presence of a primary crack before solidification of liquid steel. Controlling the primary cracks lead to reduce chances of breakouts. Breakout prediction system of Bokaro Steel Limited uses only thermocouples temperature as an input of logic based algorithm controlled by strand PLC to predict breakout and generate alarm. This system sometimes generates lots of false alarm and sometimes even fails to generate an alarm before breakout. In this paper, two back-propagation neural networks are developed to predict the presence of primary crack that might lead to breakout of liquid steel. One is neural network1 train only with one input parameter (temperatures of thermocouples attached to the mould) and the other is neural network2 train with three input parameters (temperatures of thermocouples, casting speed and mould level). Both the neural network1 and network2 have only one output. Output of neural networks is either 0 for no alarm (no primary crack) or 1 for alarm (presence of primary crack) in breakout conditions. Comparison of the network1 with network2 showed that network2 has less output error, better performance and identifies primary crack more accurately. Performance of neural networks are done using Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm, and also log sigmoid transfer function is used for both the hidden and output layer. The neural networks model training, validation and testing is done by simulating in Mat-Lab/Simulink. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Breakout prediction; Continuous casting; Mat-Lab/Simulink; Mould; Neural network; Thermocouple temperature","Alarm systems; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Computation theory; Continuous casting; Cracks; Forecasting; Hazards; Liquid metals; Liquids; Machinery; Molds; Neural networks; Thermocouples; Back propagation neural networks; Breakout predictions; Continuous casting of steels; Cost of productions; Expensive machines; Neural networks model; Sigmoid transfer function; Training algorithms; Steel castings","Ghose, J.; Department of Production Engineering, BIT, MesraIndia; email: joyjeetghose@gmail.com","Sahana S.K.Saha S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811025242,,,"English","Adv.

The use of Fuzzy imparts a logical inference mechanism which rules out non-monotonous reasoning perspective of this dynamicity. The algorithm is robust and adaptive to varied environments. The proposed algorithm will be beneficial for more accurate Engineering in terms of reducing the failures and being more specific in answering the allocation of the resources and how the work has to be undertaken using those resources.

Due to the presence of multi-control gates in the circuit block for a 5-qubit QECC, this block cannot be readily implemented with present day technology. Further, the fault-tolerant decomposition of the QECC circuit block requires a large number of quantum logic gates (resources). In this paper, we (i) propose a smaller 5-qubit error detection circuit which can also correct a single error in 2 of the 5 qubits, and (ii) establish how to use a 3-qubit error correction circuit to correct the single errors when detected in the other 3 qubits. This approach to quantum error-correction circuit design, functionally equivalent to a 5-qubit QECC, yields a significant reduction in the number of quantum logic gates. For a given quantum logic circuit, we also provide a scheme to decide the locations where these error detection and error correction blocks are to be placed in attaining reduction in gate requirement compared to the case where the original 5-qubit QECC block is used. A comparative study of the resource requirement for the benchmark circuits shows that the proposed method outperforms even Shor and Steane codes in terms of resources. Thus, our proposed method provides quantum error correction with minimum qubit requirement and reduced resource requirement on the average. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Computation theory; Electric network analysis; Error correction; Error detection; Errors; Integrated circuit manufacture; Logic circuits; Logic gates; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Benchmark circuit; Comparative studies; Detection circuits; Error correction circuit; Quantum error correcting codes; Quantum error corrections; Quantum logic gate; Resource requirements; Computer circuits","Majumdar, R.; B.P.

On the contrary, the proposed structure consists of Plasmonic waveguides whose thickness is much smaller than the wavelength of operation. Plasmonics can pave way for the development of optical interconnects that are small enough to operate in nanoscale devices. Nowadays, Plasmonics is being implemented in a large number of areas, one of which is confinement of optical power in subwavelength devices. This may pave the way for large scale on-chip integration for the development of all optical circuits for optical computing systems. Moreover, the proposed design is simple and easy to fabricate using techniques like thin-film technology and lithography.

This paper demonstrates the dynamic model of single-stage three-phase impedance source inverter or Z-source inverter connected to grid. Here ZSI connected to PV is analyzed and designed. As the output of the PV array is very low, in order to commercialize and utilize this, the output voltage must be increased. So to boost up the voltage, Z-source inverter (ZSI) is used instead of VSI or CSI. Different pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are used to provide pulses for PV connected Z-source converter (ZSI).

Analysis of the network suggests that sports network can be considered as small world and inherits all characteristics of small world network. Making a quantitative measure for an individual performance in the team sports is important in respect to the fact that for team selection of International football matches, from a pool of best players, only 11 players can be selected for the team. The statistical record of each player is considered as a traditional way of quantifying the performance of a player. But other criteria like performing against a strong opponent or executing a brilliant performance against a strong team deserves more credit. In this paper, a method based on social networking is presented to quantify the quality of player’s efficiency and is defined as the total matches played between each team members of individual teams and the members of different teams. The application of Social Network Analysis (SNA) is explored to measure performances and rank of the players.

This paper deals with the prediction of mechanical properties of the soil based on the experimental and computational model of a six-wheeled rocker bogie rover. The work is divided into two parts. First, a physical model of the rover was fabricated and was made to travel on an unknown loose soil on earth. For this, a known reference value of revolutions per minute (RPM) was given to the direct current (DC) motors and the corresponding linear speed of the rover was measured. Next, a terramechanics based dynamics model was developed for a nominal value of the mechanical soil properties. The RPM needed to maintain the same linear speed as the experimental value was computed for the assumed mechanical soil properties. These soil properties were altered within a range such that the RPM obtained from the experimental and the computational results were similar to maintain the same linear velocity. The results were tested and validated for different RPM values for the predicted mechanical soil properties, which proved to be satisfactory. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Arduino; Cohesion; Internal friction; L293D (motor driver); Prediction; Rocker bogie","Artificial intelligence; Bogies (railroad rolling stock); Computation theory; Computational methods; Forecasting; Internal friction; Arduino; Cohesion; Computational results; Mobility predictions; Motor driver; Prediction of mechanical properties; Revolutions per minutes; Rocker-bogie; Soils","Nithin, S.; School of Mechanical and Building Sciences, VIT UniversityIndia; email: nithin.s.nair90@gmail.com","Das S.Panigrahi B.K.Dash S.S.Vijayakumar K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031731,,,"English","Adv.

But the rapid developments of the wireless sensor networks are still as imperative research topic due to its deployment issues. This work minimises such issues in an energy efficient way by implementing a collision free data aggregation schedule. This article proposes a hybrid algorithm for data aggregation by constructing a collision free data aggregation tree called HCDA that improves the energy utilisation of the sensor nodes. The operation of HCDA is managed by two algorithms: 1) node discovery algorithm (NDA): each node finds its neighbours and chooses their corresponding child nodes to form a two-hop collision free aggregation tree; 2) hybrid data aggregation (HDA): by applying HDA algorithm on NDA aggregation tree, the sink node achieves the fast data aggregation in a collision free topology. The correctness of HCDA is formally proven and approximation and complexities have been analysed. In data aggregation process, the simulation results confirm the higher performance in terms of throughput, delivery ratio and packet delay. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Collision avoidance; Data aggregation; Energy efficiency; Event detection; Scheduling algorithm","Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Network protocols; Network security; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Aggregation trees; Approximation and complexity; Collision-aware; Data aggregation; Data aggregation tree; Energy efficient; Event detection; Hybrid algorithms; Trees (mathematics)","Gopikrishnan, S.; Department of Information Technology, Karpagam College of EngineeringIndia; email: gopikrishnanme@gmail.com",,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",14709503,,,,"English","Int.

The new algorithm introduced here, automatically searches such relationship between various devices of the virtualized environment. Due to its dynamic nature of the virtualized environment, we have to take a measurement at multiple points of time, any relationship which holds good across these time intervals are considered as dependent variables.

A MANET does not require any infrastructure; moreover, it can behave as a mobile network. These features have boosted the popularity of MANETs in the community. As more and more fields become dependent on MANETs, the system needs to be more energy aware and low cost. To commercialize MANETs, the routing protocols need to be lightweight, secure, and energy efficient, and the hardware on which it is to be implemented should be low cost at the same time. In this paper, we have proposed a lightweight, energy aware, secure routing model for MANETs, which has been implemented on low-cost hardware. Our model uses fidelity to allocate trust to a neighbor, thereby taking the decision whether to send data via that secure neighbor or not. It also uses packets like Report and Recommendation that help the protocol to detect and eliminate the malicious nodes from the network. To make the protocol energy aware we have formulated new battery thresholds, so that the battery can be monitored and losses can be minimized. To observe the results we implement this protocol in hardware, on the Arduino platform, which is a scalable, reliable, cheap, and open source. We observe that our protocol exhibits high packet delivery fraction, low normalize routing load, and low end to end delay, compared to existing secure routing protocols. © 2017 TÜBITAK.","Arduino; Battery; Fidelity; Hardware implementation; Low cost; Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs); Personal area network; Secure","Costs; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Hardware security; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Network security; Open systems; Personal communication systems; Power management; Routing protocols; Arduino; Battery; Fidelity; Hardware implementations; Low costs; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Secure; Power management (telecommunication)","Saha, H.N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Institute of Engineering and ManagementIndia; email: him_shree_2004@yahoo.com",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010818974

The goals of the paper is; (1) Analyze the tracking accuracy for a target moving in WSN with multiple clusters; (2) Understanding type of relation between the energy consumption and tracking accuracy in WSN. In the posed experimental scenario, nodes are uniformly distributed in a cluster and they collaborate to track the target moving with a variable velocity. The distance between target and a nearest sensor node is measured and then sent to cluster head for estimating target location. Accuracies of target locations and tracking is calculated from these distance measurements. In this paper we examine effects of varying noise power on the tracking accuracy, effect of cluster size and node density on the target location accuracy. We also focus on energy consumption with respect to change in noise variance and node sensing range. We establish that increase in cluster size improves target tracking accuracy at the cost of increase in energy consumption. Target detection accuracy is dependent on cluster size, node distribution within cluster and also on accuracy of distance measurements. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cluster; Distance measurement accuracy; Energy efficiency; Target tracking accuracy; Wireless sensor network","Cluster analysis; Clutter (information theory); Distance measurement; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Location; Sensor nodes; Tracking (position); Wireless sensor networks; Cluster; Detection accuracy; Multiple clusters; Node distribution; Target location; Tracking accuracy; Variable velocities; Within clusters; Target tracking","Patel, N.; Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Sarvajanik College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: niteen.patel@scet.ac.in","Modi N.Verma P.Trivedi B.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811027499,,,"English","Adv.

Such fraction of energy required by the processor defers to reduce with the advancement of semiconductor technology and thereby, it is essential to design energy-efficient register-file architecture for the contemporary scenario. This paper presents new register-file architecture called the bi-modal multi-banked register-file organization to capture short term reused and short lived operands to alleviate load on register file to read and write. Additionally, instruction decode stage of the processor architecture is restructured to capture the reused and short lived register operands. On incorporating these new features, we have conceived a processor architecture that has been synthesized and post-layout simulated in 180nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology node. It consumes 35 mW of total power at 200MHz of clock frequency. The bi-modal multi-banked register-file organization stores a fraction of data bandwidth, which is local to the functional units, resulting in the reduction of cost for supplying data to the execute stage. Subsequently, the proposed architecture is made to execute MiBench benchmark kernels and it showed upto 55% improvement in energy saving over an embedded reduced instruction-set computer (RISC) processor architecture. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","CMOS and very-large scale-integration (VLSI) design; Computer architecture; Embedded processor; Energy conservation; Register files","CMOS integrated circuits; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; File organization; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Semiconductor device manufacture; VLSI circuits; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; Embedded processors; Processor architectures; Proposed architectures; Reduced instruction set computers; Register files; Semiconductor technology; Very large scale integration designs; Computer architecture","Shrestha, R.; School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) MandiIndia; email: rahul_shrestha@iitmandi.ac.in","Kaushik B.K.Dasgupta S.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811074691,,,"English","Commun.

Infections can be in two main forms, namely the DF (Dengue Fever), and DHF (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever). An efficient detection method for both fever types turns out to be a significant task. Thus, in the present work, a novel application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been employed to separate the patients having Dengue fevers from those who are recovering from it or do not have DF. The ANN’s input weight vector are optimized using PSO to achieve the expected accuracy and to avoid premature convergence toward the local optima. Therefore, a gene expression data (GDS5093 dataset) available publicly is used. The dataset contains gene expression data for DF, DHF, convalescent and healthy control patients of total 56 subjects. Greedy forward selection method has been applied to select most promising genes to identify the DF, DHF and normal (either convalescent or healthy controlled) patients. The proposed system performance was compared to the multilayer perceptron feed-forward neural network (MLP-FFN) classifier.

In this paper we extend this special dissecting capacity of certain classes of string languages to matrix languages.

In drug discovery, target protein identification is important step as its inhibition may disturb the activities of pathogen. So, the knowledge of protein function is necessary to inspect the cause of diseases. In this work, we have proposed two function prediction methods FunPred1.1 and FunPred1.2 which use neighbourhood analysis of unknown protein empowered with Amino Acid physico-chemical properties. The basic objective and working of these two methods are almost similar but FunPred1.1 works on the entire neighbourhood graph of unknown protein whereas FunPred1.2 does same with greater efficiency on the densely connected neighbourhood graph considering edge clustering coefficient. In terms of time and performance, FunPred1.2 achieves better than FunPred1.1.

Data mining techniques have allowed regimented discovery of knowledge from huge databases. Conversely, in the case of sharing the data with others, knowledge discovery raises the possibility of revealing the sensitive knowledge. The need of privacy prompted the growth of numerous privacy-preserving data mining techniques. In order to deal with privacy concerns, the database is to be transformed into another database in such a way that the sensitive knowledge is concealed. One subarea of privacy-preserving data mining, which got attention in retail businesses, is privacy-preserving association rule mining. A significant feature of privacy-preserving association rule mining is attaining a balance between privacy and precision, which is characteristically conflicting, and refining the one generally reduces the other one. In this paper, the problem has been planned in the perspective of protecting association rules which are sensitive by prudently amending the transactions of the database. To moderate the loss of non-sensitive association rules and to improve the quality of the transformed database, the proposed approach competently estimates the impact of an alteration to the database. The proposed method selects the transactions for alterations using the binary TLBO optimization technique during the concealing process. Experimental outcomes exhibit the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Association rule mining; Data sharing; Optimization; Privacy; Sanitization; Sensitive knowledge; TLBO","Association rules; Bins; Computation theory; Data mining; Database systems; Intelligent computing; Optimization; Data Sharing; Optimization techniques; Privacy preserving; Privacy preserving data mining; Sanitization; Sensitive association rules; Sensitive knowledge; TLBO; Data privacy","Kalyani, G.; Acharya Nagarjuna UniversityIndia; email: kalyani4work@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

In, this article, energy efficient and balanced route generation algorithm is proposed, with considering both energy efficacy and energy balancing issues. Here, we consider, the distance and residual energy of the nodes as energy efficiency parameters, and energy is balanced by diverting the incoming traffic to other nodes having comparably, lower incoming traffic. To develop the routing schedule, we have applied, Genetic Algorithm which can quickly compute the routing schedule as per the current, state of the network.

Spectral Clustering techniques are developed by using concepts of graph, algebra theories and conventional clustering methods. The theories and experiments conducted in various areas like, pattern recognition and image segmentation prove that it is having global reputation. This paper is to provide a framework for spectral clustering in different phases and its advantages when compared with traditional data clustering algorithms. In lieu of this paper, it is upgraded by intervening the inputs such as to making the bounds of clustering i.e., providing the issues through its relevance factors-produced by spectral clustering. On the other hand, some fundamental issues related to improving the quality of the output clusters are also covered. Constructing a sound similarity matrix is the most direct and efficient way to improve the quality of clusters. For building the similarity matrix sometimes we may choose the distance measures for measuring the similarity. This paper provides the issues related to improving the quality of the clusters produced by spectral clustering. We implemented spectral clustering in WEKA tool and produced the results for different similarity measures and observed how the quality of the clusters improved.

Pending cases related to domestic violence in different courts need to be resolved faster to give proper justice to the victims and their families. In this paper a fuzzy logic-based legal expert system, ‘UMEED’, is proposed that emulates the decision-making ability of a legal expert, to address different legal issues regarding domestic violence. The system is proposed in such a way that it produces the expert opinion on this subject within the legal bounds. Being a rule-based system it acts as a legal advisor for the lawyers and ensures faster delivery of the legal decisions, and hence reduces overall decision-making time and effort.

The nodes in these networks are having limited range to couple with other nodes. Hence in order to transmit data, they establish a route between source and destination nodes through hop level nodes. The critical point of the route establishment is selection of optimal neighbor nodes in the context of Quality of Service. This is much critical if data to be transferred to multiple destinations, which can be referred as multicast routing. In order to optimize the process of neighbor node selection in multicast route establishment, here in this article we proposed an energy efficient multicast routing topology, which is based on Exploratory Assessment based Child Nodes Selection (EACNS). EACNS is a Tree-based multicast routing topology for mobile ad hoc networks distinguishing from others in its class by the defining an exploratory scale to assess the optimal child nodes towards minimal energy usage and maximal network life. The objective the model is to be loosely coupled route selection strategy to any of the benchmarking tree based multicast routing protocols explored in literature. The strategy that used to select tree based multicast route is an explorative scale that defined based on three metrics coined in this paper, which are called energy consumption ratio, reserve battery life and multicast scope.

The load flow studies are very important, not only in finding static states but also during distribution system planning and its extension. In this paper, the load flow problem has been solved by artificial neural networks and these networks are efficient to describe the relation involved within the raw data. Two types neural networks are proposed to solve load flow problem of a distribution system, first one is Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN) and other one is Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network with Backpropagation Algorithm (MFFN with BPA). The mathematical model of distribution load flow comprises a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that are solved using network topology-based distribution load flow which is usurped as reference off-line load flow. A series of training data is generated using off-line load flow, which is used to train the neural networks. The training data consists of different loading conditions and voltages corresponding to each and every node in the distribution system. The neural networks are trained with series of training data and tested with a loading which is not present in training data. Results obtained from two neural networks closely agrees with the reference off-line load flow result of same loading. The results of neural networks are compared together and computational time of two neural networks is considerably small. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Backpropagation algorithm⋅(BPA); Load flow solution; Mean square error (MSE); Multilayer feedforward neural network with backpropagation algorithm (MFFN with BPA); RBFN","Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Computation theory; Deep neural networks; Feedforward neural networks; Intelligent computing; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Neural networks; Nonlinear equations; Radial basis function networks; Topology; Distribution load flow; Distribution system planning; Distribution systems; Load flow solutions; Multilayer feedforward neural networks; Nonlinear algebraic equations; Radial basis function neural networks; RBFN; Electric load flow","Suresh, M.; Vignan’s Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: msushe56@gmail.com","Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031526,,,"English","Adv.

The three main objectives of this paper are to minimize the power consumption as well as to improve the utilization of resources and also to cut down the cost11 for both the cloud users and cloud service providers. Hence an efficient Tri-objective Resource optimization algorithm has been proposed to achieve the objectives. This algorithm finds the most energy efficient resource for the requested task. Two cost functions were used to compute the cost. Excess power consumption results in higher operational cost and in increased level of carbon emission which pollutes the environment. Hence the proposed algorithm is intended to optimize the resource usage thus improve the energy efficiency of the system and by this way to attain the environment sustainability. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Each state is represented by multi-objective fitness functions and presented as a composite function of one or more radio parameters. A dynamic heterogeneous mobile WASN system has been simulated to develop an optimal model for energy consumption and throughput based on NSGA-II for stable clustering and routing. Computation has been made on the fitness score by considering multiple outcomes at times and then, evolving the solutions until optimal value is reached. The final results are represented as a set of optimal solutions called Pareto-front. The multi-objective optimization has been performed in this paper by considering multiple objectives.

A delay-tolerant network suffers from nodes energy efficiency issues due to frequent mobility and reliable transmission of data packet from source to destination. Due to the mobility of the node there are frequent changes in the path. Due to which enormous amount of energy is wasted. So to conserve the energy of the node energy efficient transmission from one node to another node can be achieved by using the proposed algorithm EADBNHS. Connectivity of the network can be determined by Synchronism, Simultaneousness and Discontinuity using EADBNHS. EADBNHS is the algorithm devised for energy efficiency in this article. To achieve energy efficiency of a node the algorithm is designed in a way, which includes transmission energy, reception energy and the health of the node. This algorithm supports energy efficient transfer of data packet; it selects a node on the basis of minimum energy available on the node and on the basis of its connectivity to other nodes. With the help of Synchronicity, Simultaneousness and Discontinuity we can easily judge a node’s condition to become the participant node in the path from source to destination. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Delay tolerant networks; Destination node; Energy efficiency; Mandatory storage; Network lifetime; Quality of service; Source node","Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Quality of service; Routers; Wireless networks; Delaytolerant networks (DTNs); Destination nodes; Energy efficient; Mobile wireless network; Network lifetime; Reliable transmission; Source nodes; Transmission energy; Delay tolerant networks","Kumar, R.; Department of CSE, Chandigarh University, Gharaun, India; email: rohitbhullar@gmail.com","Singh V.K.Tiwari S.Mishra K.K.Bhatia S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811037696,,,"English","Adv.

Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) is an advanced form of WSN with node mobility which is highly useful in several real time applications. Energy efficiency is the major challenge while designing MWSN. Clustering is one of the important energy efficient techniques to effectively utilize the available resources and also node mobility relieves hotspots problem. Clustering is the process of grouping the nodes into clusters. A cluster consists of a Cluster Head (CH) and number of cluster members. CH is responsible for collecting data from cluster members, aggregating it and forwarding the aggregated data to Base Station (BS). So, CH selection plays a vital role to preserve energy in MWSN. As CH selection influences the overall performance of the MWSN, many researchers are carried out to select the proper CHs. In this paper, a dynamic CH selection using Fuzzy logic is proposed. The fuzzy input parameters are residual energy, distance to BS and node mobility. The output parameter is the probability of becoming CH. The proposed method is compared to the well known clustering protocol LEACH. Simulation results shows that the proposed method produces better results than LEACH interms of energy consumption and network lifetime. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Towards the performance improvement in database mining, co-clustering approaches were used to minimize the search overhead. For the co-clustering of data, information based co-clustering (ITCC) has been used as an optimal means of clustering. However, in this co-clustering approach, elements are clustered based on Bregman divergence criterion, following the convergence of Bregman Index optimization using Euclidean distance (ED) approach. The ED approach works over the magnitude values of the elements, without consideration of the data relations. In many applications, relationship between elements played a significant role in making decision.

In this work, a fuzzy-based technique for uniform resource locater (URL) assignment in dynamic web crawler is proposed that utilizes the task splitting property of the processor. In order to optimize the performance of the crawler, the proposed scheme addresses two important aspects, (i) creation of crawling framework with load balancing among parallel crawlers, and (ii) making of crawling process faster by using parallel crawlers with efficient network access.

A temporal association pattern is said to be similar if it satisfies specified subset constraints. The apriori algorithm which is designed for static databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns from temporal databases as patterns are vectors with supports computed at different time slots and Euclidean distance do not satisfy monotonicity property. The brute force approach to find similar temporal patterns requires computing 2n true support combinations for ‘n’ items from finite item set and problem falls in NP-class. In this present research, we come up with novel approach to discover temporal association which are similar for pre-specified subset constraints, and substantially reduce support computations.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an algorithm based on the Haar wavelets operational matrix for computational modelling of nonlinear hyperbolic type wave equations has been developed. These types of equations describe a variety of physical models in nonlinear optics, relativistic quantum mechanics, solitons and condensed matter physics, interaction of solitons in collision-less plasma and solid-state physics, etc. The algorithm reduces the equations into a system of algebraic equations and then the system is solved by the Gauss-elimination procedure. Some well-known hyperbolic-type wave problems are considered as numerical problems to check the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The numerical results are shown in figures and Linf, RMS and L2 error forms. Findings - The developed algorithm is used to find the computational modelling of nonlinear hyperbolic-type wave equations. The algorithm is well suited for some well-known wave equations. Originality/value - This paper extends the idea of one dimensional Haar wavelets algorithms (Jiwari, 2015, 2012; Pandit et al., 2015; Kumar and Pandit, 2014, 2015) for two-dimensional hyperbolic problems and the idea of this algorithm is quite different from the idea for elliptic problems (Lepik, 2011; Shi et al., 2012).

Traditional cryptography methods are not supportable in WSNs as they have high energy and resource constraints. Trust management has been proved to be an effective measure to enhance security as well as to handle threats for WSNs. Trust can be defined as level of reliableness in a node. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering (LEACH) is a cluster based routing protocol for WSN which is superior to direct communication protocol and known for its minimum transmission energy. However, LEACH itself has some limitations related to security. In this paper, an energy efficient and trust aware framework for secure routing in LEACH (EETA-LEACH), has been proposed that improves LEACH protocol by introducing trust to provide secure routing, while maintaining originality of LEACH protocol. This approach is a combination of trust-based routing module and trust management module that works together to select trusted Cluster Head (CH). The simulation results demonstrate that proposed scheme is better in terms of network lifetime and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR).

Parity-preserving reversible logic design is one viable approach towards fault detection. Interestingly, most of the existing designs are ad hoc, based on some pre-defined parity preserving reversible gates as building blocks. In the current work, we propose a systematic approach towards parity preserving reversible circuit design. We prove a few theoretical results and present two algorithms, one from reversible specification to parity preserving reversible specification and another from irreversible specification to parity preserving reversible specification. We derive an upper-bound for the number of garbage bits for our algorithm and perform its complexity analysis. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by extensive experimental results and compare with the state-of-the-art practices. To our knowledge, this is the first work towards systematic design of parity preserving reversible circuit and more research is needed in this area to make this approach more scalable. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Fault tolerance; Parity; Quantum computing; Reversible circuits","Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Historic preservation; Integrated circuit manufacture; Logic gates; Quantum computers; Specifications; Timing circuits; Complexity analysis; Parity; Parity preserving; Quantum Computing; Reversible circuits; Reversible gates; State of the art; Systematic designs; Computer circuits","Paul, G.; Cryptology and Security Research Unit (CSRU), R.C.

It is one of the potential technologies adopted for Internet of Things (IoT) and other futuristic machine-to-machine-based applications. Many of these applications are power constrained and delay sensitive. Therefore, CRSN architecture must be coupled with different adaptive and robust communication schemes to take care of the delay and energy efficiency at the same time. Considering the tradeoff that exists in terms of energy efficiency and overhead delay for a given data packet length, it is proposed to transmit the physical layer payload with an optimal packet size (OPS) depending on the network condition. Furthermore, due to the cognitive feature of CRSN architecture overhead energy consumption due to channel sensing and channel handoff plays a critical role. Based on the above premises, in this paper, we propose a heuristic exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 and a computationally efficient suboptimal low complexity Karuh-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition-based Algorithm-2 to determine the OPS in CRSN architecture using variable rate m-QAM modulation. The proposed algorithms are implemented along with two main cognitive radio assisted channel access strategies based on distributed time slotted-cognitive medium access control (DTS-CMAC) and centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control (CC-CMAC) and their performances are compared. The simulation results reveal that proposed Algorithm-2 outperforms Algorithm-1 by a significant margin in terms of its implementation time. For the exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 the average time consumed to determine OPS for a given number of cognitive users is 1.2 s, while for KKT-based Algorithm-2, it is of the order of 5-10 ms. CC-CMAC with OPS is most efficient in terms of overall energy consumption but incurs more delay as compared to DTS-CMAC with OPS scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","cognitive radio sensor networks; convex optimization; energy-efficiency; medium access control; Optimal packet size; quadrature amplitude modulation","Access control; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Medium access control; Mobile telecommunication systems; Modulation; Network architecture; Network layers; Optimization; Packet networks; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Radio systems; Sensor networks; Common control channels; Communication paradigm; Computationally efficient; Internet of Things (IOT); Optimal packet sizes; Potential technologies; Search-based algorithms; Short range data communication; Cognitive radio","Majumdar, C.; 1IIT BombayIndia; email: cm6v07@ee.iitb.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028034490

State of the art in this area describes various complex techniques to determine OPS for CRSNs. However, it is observed that under high interference from the surrounding users, it is not possible to determine a feasible OPS of data transmission under the simple point-to-point CRSN topology. This is contributed primarily to the peak transmit power constraint of the cognitive nodes. To address this specific challenge, this paper proposes a multiple-input multiple output-based CRSNs (MIMO-CRSNs) architecture for futuristic technologies, such as Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communications. A joint optimization problem is formulated, considering network constraints, such as the overall end-to-end latency, interference duration caused to the non-cognitive users, average BER, and transmit power. We propose our Algorithm 1 based on the generic exhaustive search technique to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, a low complexity suboptimal Algorithm 2 based on solving classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions is proposed. These algorithms for MIMO-CRSNs are implemented in conjunction with two different channel access schemes. These channel access schemes are time-slotted distributed cognitive medium access control denoted as MIMO-DTS-CMAC and CSMA/CA-assisted centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control denoted as MIMO-CC-CMAC. Simulations reveal that the proposed MIMO-CRSN outperforms the conventional point-to-point CRSN in terms of overall energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 show a perfect match, and the implementation complexity of Algorithm 2 is less than Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 takes almost 680 ms to execute and provides OPS value for a given number of users, whereas Algorithm 2 takes 4-5 ms on average to find the OPS for the proposed MIMO-CRSN framework. © 2013 IEEE.","cognitive radio sensor networks; convex optimization; energy-efficiency; medium access control; Optimal packet size; quadrature amplitude modulation","Access control; Automation; Codes (symbols); Cognitive radio; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Feedback control; Internet of things; Machine-to-machine communication; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Optimization; Packet networks; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Radio systems; Sensor networks; Telecommunication repeaters; Common control channels; End to end latencies; Implementation complexity; Karush Kuhn tucker condition; Optimal packet sizes; Optimization problems; Peak transmit power; Sub-optimal algorithms; Medium access control","Majumdar, C.; IIT BombayIndia; email: cm6v07@ee.iitb.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029597367

In TMIS, users generally communicate via public channels. Hence, authentication is essential to provide access to the genuine users. However, access rights for the correct information and resources for different services to the genuine users can be provided with the help of efficient user access control mechanism. The existing user authentication protocols designed for TMIS only provide authentication, but for this kind of application, it is required that the authorized users should also have unique access privilege to access specific data. This paper puts forwards a new fine grained access control with user authentication scheme for TMIS. We present the formal security analysis using both the widely accepted real-or-random model and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. The proposed scheme supports user anonymity, forward secrecy, and efficient password change without contacting the remote server. In addition, the proposed scheme is comparable with respect to communication and computation costs as compared with other related schemes proposed in TMIS. Moreover, better tradeoff among security and functionality features, and communication and computation costs makes the proposed scheme suitable and practical for telecare medicine environments as compared with other existing related schemes. © 2017 IEEE.","BAN logic; bilinear maps; biometric authentication; Fine-grained access control; fuzzy extractor; ROR model; security; telecare medicine information systems","Authentication; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Information systems; Network protocols; BAN logic; Bilinear map; Biometric authentication; Fine grained; Fuzzy extractors; security; Telecare; Access control","Park, Y.; School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National UniversitySouth Korea; email: parkyh@knu.ac.kr",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028763415

Like our previous work on the LRB branching heuristic, we once again view these heuristics as techniques to solve the learning rate optimization problem. First, we show that there is a strong positive correlation between GLR and solver efficiency for a variety of branching heuristics. Second, we test our hypothesis further by developing a new branching heuristic that maximizes GLR greedily. We show empirically that this heuristic achieves very high GLR and interestingly very low literal block distance (LBD) over the learnt clauses. In our experiments this greedy branching heuristic enables the solver to solve instances faster than VSIDS, when the branching time is taken out of the equation. This experiment is a good proof of concept that a branching heuristic maximizing GLR will lead to good solver performance modulo the computational overhead. Third, we propose that machine learning algorithms are a good way to cheaply approximate the greedy GLR maximization heuristic as already witnessed by LRB. In addition, we design a new branching heuristic, called SGDB, that uses a stochastic gradient descent online learning method to dynamically order branching variables in order to maximize GLR. We show experimentally that SGDB performs on par with the VSIDS branching heuristic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Computation theory; Formal logic; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Branching heuristics; Computational overheads; Empirical studies; On-line learning methods; Positive correlations; Solver performance; Stochastic gradient descent; Through the lens; Heuristic methods","Liang, J.H.; University of WaterlooCanada; email: jliang@gsd.uwaterloo.ca","Gaspers S.Walsh T.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319662626,,,"English","Lect.

In this model, security of the scheme is guaranteed as long as the number of colluding adversaries can be a-priori bounded by some polynomial Q. Our construction supports arithmetic circuits in contrast to all prior work which support Boolean circuits. The ciphertext of our scheme is sublinear in the circuit size for the circuit class NC1; this implies the first construction of arithmetic reusable garbled circuits for NC1. Additionally, our construction achieves several desirable features: Our construction for reusable garbled circuits for NC1 achieves the optimal “full” simulation based security.When generalised to handle Q queries for any fixed polynomial Q, our ciphertext size grows additively with Q2. In contrast, previous works that achieve full security [5, 39] suffered a multiplicative growth of Q4.The ciphertext of our scheme can be divided into a succinct data dependent component and a non-succinct data independent component. This makes it well suited for optimization in an online-offline model that allows a majority of the computation to be performed in an offline phase, before the data becomes available. Security of our reusable garbled circuits construction for NC1 is based on the Ring Learning With Errors assumption (RLWE), while the bounded collusion construction (with non-succinct ciphertext) may also be based on the standard Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. To achieve our result, we provide new public key and ciphertext evaluation algorithms.

We begin by showing that the more general problem of testing whether f can be obtained from g by an arbitrary (not necessarily invertible) linear transformation of the variables is equivalent to the existential theory over the reals. This strengthens an NP-hardness result by Kayal [9]. Two n-variate polynomials f and g are said to be equivalent up to scaling if there are scalars a1, …, an F\{0} ∈such that f(a1, …, an) = g(x1, …, xn). Testing whether two polynomials are equivalent by scaling matrices is a special case of the polynomial equivalence problem and is harder than the polynomial identity testing problem. As our main result, we obtain a randomized polynomial time algorithm for testing if two polynomials are equivalent up to a scaling of variables with black-box access to polynomials f and g over the real numbers. An essential ingredient to our algorithm is a randomized polynomial time algorithm that given a polynomial as a black box obtains coefficients and degree vectors of a maximal set of monomials whose degree vectors are linearly independent.

Therefore, to perform any operation, the processor must first read the source data and then write the result back to memory after performing the operation. This approach consumes high latency, bandwidth, and energy for operations that work on a large amount of data. Several works have proposed techniques to process data near memory by adding a small amount of compute logic closer to the main memory chips. In this chapter, we describe two techniques proposed by recent works that take this approach of processing in memory further by exploiting the underlying operation of the main memory technology to perform more complex tasks. First, we describe RowClone, a mechanism that exploits DRAM technology to perform bulk copy and initialization operations completely inside main memory. We then describe a complementary work that uses DRAM to perform bulk bitwise AND and OR operations inside main memory.

These devices can be remotely accessed and controlled using existing network infrastructure, thus allowing a direct integration of computing systems with the physical world. This also reduces human involvement along with improving accuracy and efficiency, resulting in economic benefit. The devices in IoT facilitate the day-to-day life of people. However, the IoT has an enormous threat to security and privacy due to its heterogeneous and dynamic nature. Authentication is one of the most challenging security requirements in the IoT environment, where a user (external party) can directly access information from the devices, provided the mutual authentication between user and devices happens. In this paper, we present a new signature-based authenticated key establishment scheme for the IoT environment. The proposed scheme is tested for security with the help of the widely used Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, informal security analysis, and also the formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. The proposed scheme is also implemented using the widely accepted NS2 simulator, and the simulation results demonstrate the practicability of the scheme. Finally, the proposed scheme provides more functionality features, and its computational and communication costs are also comparable with other existing approaches. © 2017 IEEE.","authentication; AVISPA; Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic; Internet of things (IoT); key establishment; NS2 simulation; security","Authentication; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Network protocols; Network security; AVISPA; Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic; Internet of Things (IOT); Key establishments; NS-2 simulations; security; Internet of things","Yoon, E.-J.; Department of Cyber Security, Kyungil UniversitySouth Korea; email: ejyoon@kiu.kr",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018510573

These types of equations describe a variety of physical models in the vibrations of structures, nonlinear optics, quantum field theory and solid-state physics, etc. Design/methodology/approach: Dirichlet boundary conditions cannot be handled easily by cubic trigonometric B-spline functions. Then, a modification is made in cubic trigonometric B-spline functions to handle the Dirichlet boundary conditions and a numerical algorithm is developed. The proposed algorithm reduced the hyperbolic-type wave equations into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time variable. Then, stability-preserving SSP-RK54 scheme and the Thomas algorithm are used to solve the obtained system. The stability of the algorithm is also discussed. Findings: A different technique based on modified cubic trigonometric B-spline functions is proposed which is quite different from the schemes developed (Abbas et al., 2014; Nazir et al., 2016) and depicts the computational modelling of hyperbolic-type wave equations. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this technique is novel for solving hyperbolic-type wave equations and the developed algorithm is free from quasi-linearization process and finite difference operators for time derivatives.

We have developed an efficient and accurate numerical method to investigate light scattering from plasmonic nanospheres on a substrate covered by a shell, based on the Green's function approach with suitable spherical harmonic basis. Next, we use this method to study optical scattering from DNA molecules attached to metallic nanoparticles placed on a substrate and compare with experimental results. We obtain fairly good agreement between theoretical predictions and the measured ellipsometric spectra. The metallic nanoparticles were used to detect the binding with DNA molecules in a microfluidic setup via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and a detectable change in ellipsometric spectra was found when DNA molecules are captured on Au nanoparticles. Our theoretical simulation indicates that the coverage of Au nanosphere by a submonolayer of DNA molecules, which is modeled by a thin layer of dielectric material (which may absorb light), can lead to a small but detectable spectroscopic shift in both the Ψ and Δ spectra with more significant change in Δ spectra in agreement with experimental results. Our studies demonstrated the ultrasensitive capability of SE for sensing submonolayer coverage of DNA molecules on Au nanospheres. Hence the spectroscopic ellipsometric measurements coupled with theoretical analysis via an efficient computation method can be an effective tool for detecting DNA molecules attached on Au nanoparticles, thus achieving label-free, non-destructive, and high-sensitivity biosensing with nanoscale resolution. © 2017 SPIE.","Biological sensing and sensors; Ellipsometry and polarimetry; Scattering theory","Computation theory; Dielectric materials; DNA; Ellipsometry; Gold; Light scattering; Molecules; Nanoparticles; Nanospheres; Numerical methods; Physiology; Plasmons; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Biological sensing and sensors; Ellipsometric measurements; Ellipsometry and polarimetry; Green's function approaches; Metallic nanoparticles; Scattering theory; Spherical harmonic basis; Theoretical simulation; Bioinformatics","Chang, Y.-C.; Research Center for Applied Sciences, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Taiwan; email: yiachang@gate.sinica.edu.tw","Cullum B.M.McLamore E.S.Kiehl D.L.","SPIE",0277786X,9781510609334,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025137859

In IoT, various smart objects (smart sensors, embedded devices, PDAs, and smartphones) share their data with one another irrespective of their geographical locations using the Internet. The amount of data generated by these connected smart objects will be on the order of zettabytes in the coming years. This huge amount of data creates challenges with respect to storage and analytics given the resource constraints of these smart devices. Additionally, to process the large volume of information generated, the traditional cloud-based infrastructure may lead to long response time and higher bandwidth consumption. To cope up with these challenges, a new powerful technology, edge computing, promises to support data processing and service availability to end users at the edge of the network. However, the integration of IoT and edge computing is still in its infancy. Task scheduling will play a pivotal role in this integrated architecture. To handle all the above mentioned issues, we present a novel architecture for task selection and scheduling at the edge of the network using container-as-a-service (CoaaS). We solve the problem of task selection and scheduling by using cooperative game theory. For this purpose, we developed a multi-objective function in order to reduce the energy consumption and makespan by considering different constraints such as memory, CPU, and the user's budget. We also present a real-time internal and external container migration technique for minimizing the energy consumption. For task selection and scheduling, we have used lightweight containers instead of the conventional virtual machines to reduce the overhead and response time as well as the overall energy consumption of fog devices, that is, nano data centers (nDCs). Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the energy consumption and the average number of SLA violations by 21.75 and 11.82 percent, respectively. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Computation theory; Containers; Data handling; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Game theory; Human computer interaction; Internet of things; Nanosensors; Network architecture; Scheduling; Bandwidth consumption; Cooperative game theory; Geographical locations; Integrated architecture; Migration technique; Multi-objective functions; Resource Constraint; Service availability; Green computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361284,,IWCEA,,"English","IEEE Wirel.

It establishes that for any pair of infinite sequences A and B, B is Martin-Löf random and A is Martin-Löf random relative to B if and only if the interleaved sequence A B is Martin-Löf random. This implies that A is relative random to B if and only if B is random relative to A [1–3]. This paper studies the validity of this phenomenon for different notions of time-bounded relative randomness. We prove the classical van Lambalgen theorem using martingales and Kolmogorov compressibility. We establish the failure of relative random-ness in these settings, for both time-bounded martingales and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. We adapt our classical proofs when applicable to the time-bounded setting, and construct counterexamples when they fail.

We show that while it is sensible to think of recall as simply retrieving items when probed with a cue - typically the item list itself - it is better to think of recognition as retrieving cues when probed with items. To test this theory, by manipulating the number of items and cues in a memory experiment, we show a crossover effect in memory performance within subjects such that recognition performance is superior to recall performance when the number of items is greater than the number of cues and recall performance is better than recognition when the converse holds. We build a simple computational model around this theory, using sampling to approximate an ideal Bayesian observer encoding and retrieving situational co-occurrence frequencies of stimuli and retrieval cues. This model robustly reproduces a number of dissociations in recognition and recall previously used to argue for dual-process accounts of declarative memory. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

After demonstration of such functions by Patterson and Wiedemann in 1983, for more than three decades the efforts have been channelized in obtaining the instances only. For the first time, in this paper, we try to explore non-trivial upper bounds on nonlinearity of such functions which are invariant under several group actions. In fact, we consider much larger sets of functions than what have been considered so far and obtain tight upper bounds on the nonlinearity in several cases. To support our claims, we present computational results for functions on n variables where n is an odd composite integer, 9 ≤ n ≤ 39. In particular, our results for n = 15 and 21 are of immediate interest given recent research results in this domain.

They are required to respond to such challenges very rapidly and effectively so as to preserve stability and continuity of operations at any time, regardless of what may occur in the surroundings. This in fact is the true measure of what sustainable energy systems (SES) are all about, and homeostatic control (HC) of energy systems seeks just that: to enable energy systems to become highly efficient and effective very rapidly, by attaining a state of equilibrium between energy supply and energy expenditure in electric power systems (EPS) operation. To accomplish so they ought to imitate homeostasis mechanisms present in all living organisms. Ever since Cannon (1929, 1935) first introduced the concept, attention on homeostasis and its applications have been the sole patrimony of medicine and biology to find cures for diseases like diabetes and obesity. Nevertheless, homeostasis is rather an engineering concept in its very essence - even more so than in the natural sciences - and its application in the design and engineering of sustainable hybrid energy systems (SHES) is a reality. In this paper we present the groundwork that supports the theoretical model underlining the engineering of homeostasis in SHES. Homeostasis mechanisms are present in all living organisms, and thus are also applicable to EPS in order to enable and maintain a sustainable performance when EPS are linked to energy efficiency (EE) and thriftiness. In doing so, both reactive and predictive homeostasis play a substantive role in the engineering of such mechanisms. Reactive homeostasis (RH) is an immediate response of the SES to a homeostatic challenge such as energy deprivation, energy shortage or imbalance. RH entails feedback mechanisms that allow for reactive compensation, reestablishing homeostasis or efficient equilibrium in the system. Predictive homeostasis (PH), on the other hand, is a proactive mechanism which anticipates the events that are likely to occur, sending the right signals to the central controller, enabling SES to respond early and proactively to environmental challenges and concerns. The paper explores both concepts based on previous work in order to advance the research in the field of HC applied to electric power systems.","environmental challenges; exergy; homeostatic control; predictive homeostasis; Reactive; sustainable hybrid energy systems; thriftiness","Biology; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Engineering research; Exergy; Physiology; Sustainable development; Environmental challenges; Homeostatic control; Hybrid energy system; predictive homeostasis; Reactive; thriftiness; Electric power system control","Yanine, F.; College of Engineering, Universidad Finis Terrae, Av.

Research efforts relevant to these paradigms are focused on the mode selection policies which decide when to switch from CR mode (i.e., opportunistic vacant spectrum access mode) to the RFEH mode (i.e., battery charging using ambient RF energy) and vice-versa. So far, very little attention has been paid to the dual but competing task of frequency band selection in CR and RFEH modes under partially observable environment in the decentralized wireless networks. Furthermore, the need of tunable bandwidth frequency band access for CRs and lower subband switching cost (SSC) for energy efficient implementation have made the design of the decision making policy (DMP) more challenging. In this paper, a new CR-RFEH DMP has been proposed for RFEH enabled CR terminals in the decentralized wireless networks. The proposed DMP consists of three sub-units: 1) Bayesian approach based tunable Thompson sampling algorithm for subband statistics estimation, 2) Thompson sampling algorithm based subband access scheme exploiting the past collision events to minimize collisions among CRs, and 3) Mode selection scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed DMP offers 10–35% improvement in the throughput of the decentralized network and 40–90% reduction in the number of subband switchings compared to existing DMPs. The simulation results are then validated using real radio signals on the proposed USRP testbed. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit algorithms; Radio frequency energy harvesting; Thompson sampling","Bandwidth; Bayesian networks; Decision making; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Learning algorithms; Radio systems; Radio waves; Sampling; Secondary batteries; Wireless networks; Bayesian approaches; Decentralized networks; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Partially observable environments; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Thompson samplings; Cognitive radio","Darak, S.J.; Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, IIITIndia; email: Sumit@iiitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Inc.",10512004,,DSPRE,,"English","Digital Signal Process Rev J",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987941268

However, to achieve this integration and make them easy to program, we first need to enable users with varying expertise to easily develop cloud applications that leverage FPGAs. With the growing size of FPGAs, allocating them monolithically to users can be wasteful due to potentially low device utilization. Hence, we also need to be able to dynamically share FPGAs among multiple users. To address these concerns, we propose a methodology and a runtime system that together simplify the FPGA application development process by providing: 1) a clean abstraction with high-level APIs for easy application development; 2) a simple execution model that supports both hardware and software execution; and 3) a shared memory-model which is convenient to use for the programmers. Akin to an operating system on a computer, our lightweight runtime system enables the simultaneous execution of multiple applications by virtualizing computational resources, i.e., FPGA resources and on-board memory, and offers protection facilities to isolate applications from each other. In this paper, we illustrate how these features can be developed in a lightweight manner and quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead they introduce on a small set of applications running on our proof of concept prototype. Our results demonstrate that these features only introduce marginal performance overheads. More importantly, by sharing resources for simultaneous execution of multiple user applications, our platform improves FPGA utilization and delivers higher aggregate throughput compared to accessing the device in a time-shared manner. © 2013 IEEE.","Field programmable gate arrays; platform virtualization; reconfigurable architectures; runtime environment","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer operating systems; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Memory architecture; Reconfigurable architectures; Software prototyping; Aggregate throughput; Application development; Computational resources; Hardware and software; Multiple applications; Platform virtualization; Runtime environments; Shared memory model; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Asiatici, M.; School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)Switzerland; email: mikhail.asiatici@epfl.ch",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015797434

Presence of aggregation prone regions plays an important role in determining the aggregation propensity of a protein, hence understanding the characteristics of these regions is of keen interest in academia and industry. In this work, we have identified 465 aggregation prone regions with 353 unique peptides in human proteome. Evaluation of the performance of available methods for identifying these 353 peptides showed a sensitivity in the range of 15% to 90%. Further, we identified the amino acid properties enthalpy, entropy, free energy and hydrophobicity are important for promoting aggregation. Utilizing these properties, we have developed a model for distinguishing between amyloid forming and non-amyloid peptides, which showed an accuracy of 71% with a balance between sensitivity and specificity.

We measure energy efficiency by the maximum number of transmissions (‘shots’) allowed to any node in the network. In particular, we examine the case in which a bound k is given and a node may transmit at most k times during the broadcasting protocol. Initially, we focus on oblivious algorithms for k-shot broadcasting, that is, algorithms where at each step each node decides whether to transmit or not with no consideration of the transmission history. Our main contributions are (a) a lower bound of Ω(n2/k) on the broadcasting time of any oblivious k-shot broadcasting algorithm, and (b) an oblivious broadcasting protocol that achieves a matching upper bound, namely O(n2/k), for every k≤n and an upper bound of O(n3/2) for every k&gt;n. We also study the general case of adaptive broadcasting protocols where nodes decide whether to transmit based on all the available information, namely the transmission history known to each. We prove a lower bound of Ω(n1+kk) on the broadcasting time of any protocol by introducing the transmission tree construction which generalizes previous approaches. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Ad hoc radio networks; Distributed algorithms; Energy efficiency; k-shot broadcasting; Oblivious protocols; Wireless networks","Broadcasting; Parallel algorithms; Radio broadcasting; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Ad hoc radio networks; Ad hoc wireless networks; Broadcasting algorithm; Broadcasting protocols; Energy efficient broadcasting; Number of transmissions; Oblivious algorithms; Transmission trees; Energy efficiency","Pagourtzis, A.; School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of AthensGreece; email: pagour@cs.ntua.gr",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708667,,,,"English","J.

How can an artificial or real cell make inferences about its environment? From which kinds of probability distributions can chemical reaction networks sample? We begin tackling these questions by showing three ways in which a stochastic chemical reaction network can implement a Boltzmann machine, a stochastic neural network model that can generate a wide range of probability distributions and compute conditional probabilities. The resulting models, and the associated theorems, provide a road map for constructing chemical reaction networks that exploit their native stochasticity as a computational resource. Finally, to show the potential of our models, we simulate a chemical Boltzmann machine to classify and generate MNIST digits in-silico. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Calculations; Chemical reactions; Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; DNA; Probability; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Boltzmann machines; Chemical reaction networks; Computational resources; Conditional probabilities; Road-maps; Stochastic chemical reactions; Stochastic neural network; Stochasticity; Probability distributions","Gopalkrishnan, M.; India Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: manoj.gopalkrishnan@gmail.com","Brijder R.Qian L.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319667980,,,"English","Lect.

The state-of-practice of decision-making that relies heavily on human experts is often reported as ineffective, imprecise and lacking in agility. This paper evaluates a set of candidate technologies and makes a case for using actor based simulation techniques as an aid for complex dynamic decision-making. The approach is justified by enumeration of basic requirements of complex dynamic decision-making and the conducting a suitability of analysis of state-of-the-art enterprise modelling techniques. The research contributes a conceptual meta-model that represents necessary aspects of organisation for complex dynamic decision-making together with a realisation in terms of a meta model that extends Actor model of computation. The proposed approach is illustrated using a real life case study from business process outsourcing industry. Copyright © 2017 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

M2M aggregation and access barring are considered as a means to reduce congestion due to the nature of M2M traffic. The cell is modelled as a multiservice queueing system with streaming and elastic customers. Resources for M2M communications are allocated in batches of fixed size; requests for them arrive according to a Markovian arrival process. We obtain the stationary probability distribution of the system and formulas for its performance measures and propose an algorithm for their computation. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Access barring; Aggregation; Internet of things IoT; LTE; M2M; Machine-to-machine communication; Machine-type communication; Map; Markovian arrival process; MTC; Queueing system; Teletraffic theory","Agglomeration; Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Maps; Markov processes; Mobile telecommunication systems; Probability distributions; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Wireless telecommunication systems; Access barring; Machine type communications; Markovian arrival process; Queueing system; Teletraffic theory; Machine-to-machine communication","Vishnevsky, V.M.; V.A.
