Two methods have been used for further classification. In the first method, E-Gabor is used as a stand-alone feature for classification. Hypersphere-based normalization has been used for normalizing the E-Gabor features, thereby improving the efficiency in the classification of emotions. In the second method, the E-Gabor feature descriptor is fused with Pyramid Histogram of Gradient (PHOG) feature descriptor and projected to a common subspace of six dimensions using the proposed Pearson General Kernel-based Discriminant Analysis (PGK-DA) before classification. In both the methods, Pearson General Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine (PGK-ELM) is used for classification. Experiments conducted on Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE), Cohn Kanade (CK+), Multimedia Understanding Group (MUG), Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW), Oulu-Chinese Academy of Science, Institute of Automation (Oulu-CASIA) and Man–Machine Interaction (MMI) datasets report a classification accuracy of 97.6%, 97.9%, 95.7%, 35.4%, 87.7% and 82.7% with method I and 95.7%, 97.2%, 94.9%, 35.2%, 87.1% and 82.1% with method II, respectively, for seven class emotion detection, which is high when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Discriminant analysis; ELM; Emotion; Facial expression; Gabor,Discriminant analysis; Learning systems; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Classification accuracy; Classification of emotions; Emotion; Extreme learning machine; Facial Expressions; Gabor; State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information),"Alphonse, A.S.; CSE Department, Regional Campus of Anna UniversityIndia; email: sherls82@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027501922

Health informatics is important as it provides quick predictions on diseases based on nearness of symptoms. Modelling solutions for the same on cloud using deep learning is the motivation of this paper. Here, we propose a deep learning model associated with correlation based feature selection method for cirrhosis image classification. We compare the results with three other conventional classifiers algorithms to improve the better classification accuracy. First in pre-processing stage, noises are eliminated from pathological scan images by using modified laplacian pyramid non-linear diffusion filter. From the pre-processed scan images, each cirrhosis region is obtained under the guidance of radiology or physicians. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch by gray level, local binary pattern and scale invariant feature, a feature selection technique is applied to choice the predominant texture features for each classifier. Finally a convolution neural network is implemented to improve the performance of classifiers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Convolution neural network algorithm with two hidden layers gives more accuracy in classifying cirrhosis image with 98% sensitivity. Experiments are carried out with 990 cirrhosis image patches which demonstrates that our proposed deep learning classifier perform 100% well than original classifiers in terms of accuracy. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Convolution neural network; Correlation based feature selection; Liver cirrhosis classification; Modified diffusion filter; Texture features,Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Medical imaging; Ultrasonic applications; Classification accuracy; Convolution neural network; Diffusion filter; Feature selection methods; Liver cirrhosis; Performance of classifier; Scale invariant features; Texture features; Classification (of information),"Suganya, R.; Department of Information Technology, Thiagarajar College of EngineeringIndia; email: rsuganya@tce.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039695155

Literature presents several algorithms for email spam classification based on classification methods. In this paper, we propose a spam classification framework using S-Cuckoo and hybrid kernel based support vector machine (HKSVM). At first, the features are extracted from the e-mails based on the text as well as the image. For the textual features, TF-term frequency is used. For the image dependent features, correrlogram and wavelet moment are taken. The hybrid features have then high dimension so the optimum features are identified with the help of hybrid algorithm, called S-Cuckoo search. Then, the classification is done using proposed classifier HKSVM model which is designed based on the hybrid kernel by blending three different kernel functions and then it is used in the SVM classifier. The additional features provided based on image and the modification of SVM classifier provides significant improvement as compared with existing algorithms. The spam classification performance is measured by db1 (combining bare-ling spam and Spam Archive corpus) and db2 (combining lemm-ling spam and Spam Archive corpus). Experimental results show that the proposed spam classification framework has outperformed by having better accuracy of 97.235% when compared with existing approach which is able to achieve only 94.117%. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Correlogram; Cuckoo search; S-Cuckoo search; Spam; Support vector machine,Electronic mail; Image enhancement; Optimization; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Correlograms; Cuckoo searches; Electronic media; Hybrid algorithms; Spam; Spam classification; Textual features; Classification (of information),"Kumaresan, T.; Bannari Amman Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kumaresant@bitsathy.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039701994

However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance.

However, experimental identification of catalytic residues is a tedious and time-consuming task, which can be expedited by computational predictions. Despite significant development in active-site prediction methods, one of the remaining issues is ranked positions of putative catalytic residues among all ranked residues. In order to improve ranking of catalytic residues and their prediction accuracy, we have developed a meta-approach based method CSmetaPred. In this approach, residues are ranked based on the mean of normalized residue scores derived from four well-known catalytic residue predictors. The mean residue score of CSmetaPred is combined with predicted pocket information to improve prediction performance in meta-predictor, CSmetaPred_poc. Results: Both meta-predictors are evaluated on two comprehensive benchmark datasets and three legacy datasets using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision Recall (PR) curves. The visual and quantitative analysis of ROC and PR curves shows that meta-predictors outperform their constituent methods and CSmetaPred_poc is the best of evaluated methods. For instance, on CSAMAC dataset CSmetaPred_poc (CSmetaPred) achieves highest Mean Average Specificity (MAS), a scalar measure for ROC curve, of 0.97 (0.96). Importantly, median predicted rank of catalytic residues is the lowest (best) for CSmetaPred_poc. Considering residues ranked ?20 classified as true positive in binary classification, CSmetaPred_poc achieves prediction accuracy of 0.94 on CSAMAC dataset. Moreover, on the same dataset CSmetaPred_poc predicts all catalytic residues within top 20 ranks for ~73% of enzymes. Furthermore, benchmarking of prediction on comparative modelled structures showed that models result in better prediction than only sequence based predictions. These analyses suggest that CSmetaPred_poc is able to rank putative catalytic residues at lower (better) ranked positions, which can facilitate and expedite their experimental characterization. Conclusions: The benchmarking studies showed that employing meta-approach in combining residue-level scores derived from well-known catalytic residue predictors can improve prediction accuracy as well as provide improved ranked positions of known catalytic residues. Hence, such predictions can assist experimentalist to prioritize residues for mutational studies in their efforts to characterize catalytic residues.

Colour and texture from both sides of the leaf contain deterministic parameters to identify the species. This paper explores feature vectors from both the front and back side of a green leaf along with morphological features to arrive at a unique optimum combination of features that maximizes the identification rate. A database of medicinal plant leaves is created from scanned images of front and back side of leaves of commonly used ayurvedic medicinal plants. The leaves are classified based on the unique feature combination. Identification rates up to 99% have been obtained when tested over a wide spectrum of classifiers.

Since medical data usually contains a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity, proper ordering and classification require a proper comparative performance analysis of machine learning classifiers. Machine learning classifiers are applied on the Ovarian Cancer Dataset. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women, and is the deadliest of gynecological cancers. The mortality rate of ovarian cancer ranks first. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving the patients' cure rate and prolonging their survival. Here we have investigated Mass spectrometry (MS) field data to develop a computer-aided system for the purpose. Using machine learning techniques, data is classified in different categories to identify benign and malignant cancerous cells and a comparative study has been done to identify the most suitable technique under different operational conditions and datasets.

The machine learning algorithm we have proposed is the Logit model of the Logical Regression Classifier. As the process of walking is automatically controlled by the nervous system it is important to develop a non-invasive method so that patients with serious neurological disorders like Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease receive early medical attention and they get proper care before they are more affected. Swing, Stance and double support intervals (expressed as percentages of stride) of 63 subjects were analyzed. In this paper, a relevant gait signal feature extractor is developed which is combined with Logistic Regression Classifier to classify healthy subjects and pathological subjects. Analysis of real-time gait signals is simplified using the Hilbert Transform which converts the real signals into an analytic signal. The proposed algorithm was developed using the MATLAB platform and the average accuracy of multiclass classification is found to be 86.05% while the accuracy of detecting healthy subjects from pathological subjects is 87.79% and the accuracy of classifying subjects having the Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease is found to be 85.22%. © 2017 IEEE.",Feature Extraction; Gait Signals; Hilbert Transform; Logistic Regression Classifiers; Multi-class Classification,Artificial intelligence; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mathematical transformations; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurology; Noninvasive medical procedures; Regression analysis; Automatic classification; Hilbert transform; Logistic regression classifier; Logistic regressions; Machine learning approaches; Multi-class classification; Neurological disorders; Signal classification; Classification (of information),,Piuri V.Mukherjee A.Mondal A.Das A.Maulik U.Bhattacharjee D.Bhaumik H.Panigrahi B.K.Gandhi T.Bhattacharyya S.Pan I.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSO) has been widely applied to feature selection because of its efficiency and effectiveness. However, since feature selection is a challenging task with a complex search space, CSO quickly gets stuck the local minimum problem. This paper aims to improve the CSO searching ability by applying logistic and tend chaotic maps to assist the CSO swarm in exploring the search space better. The proposed chaotic chicken swarm algorithm (CCSO)-based feature selection algorithm is compared with four feature selection algorithms on five benchmark data sets. A comparison among several types of popular classifiers is done to figure out the sensitivity of each classifier corresponding to the selected features and the dimension reduction. During iterations, the best fitness value shows remarkable improvement of the classification accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",bio inspired swarm algorithm; Chaotic chicken swarm; chaotic maps; Feature selection; optimized supervised feature selection model; wrapper algorithm,Animals; Artificial intelligence; Chaotic systems; Classification (of information); Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Lyapunov methods; Optimization; Chaotic chicken swarm; Chaotic map; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Complex search spaces; Feature selection algorithm; Swarm algorithms; Swarm optimization algorithms; Feature extraction,,Piuri V.Mukherjee A.Mondal A.Das A.Maulik U.Bhattacharjee D.Bhaumik H.Panigrahi B.K.Gandhi T.Bhattacharyya S.Pan I.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this work, multi speaker shouted and single speaker normal speech classes are addressed as shouted and normal speech, respectively. Spectral features and source features are explored for the classification task. The source characteristics are studied in terms of strength of excitation (SoE). Spectral flux, spectral tilt, sum of ten largest spectral peaks (STLP), modulation spectrum energy (ModSE) and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are explored as the spectral features. Shouted and normal speech are classified using two approaches. In the first approach, these features, except MFCCs, are non-linearly mapped and combined using a threshold based technique. In the second approach, a predefined radial basis function (RBF) kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for the classification task on the extracted features. The performance evaluation is done in terms of F-Score. The performance is also evaluated on the basis of leave one out analysis to measure the strength of a particular feature for this task. By leave one out analysis, SoE is the most important feature among all one-dimensional features. When all the features are combined for classification, F-score of forty four dimensional feature is highest. © 2017 IEEE.",Shouted / normal speech classification; Source features; spectral features; SVM,Radial basis function networks; Speech; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; One-dimensional features; Performance evaluations; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Source characteristics; Source features; Spectral feature; Speech classification; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044205583

Despite all, making gestures using bare hand comes naturally to humans as compared to any input devices such as red-markers, data-glove, and 3D cameras etc. In this system, three texture features, namely, gray-level histogram, R-HoG, Gabor feature and three color-texture features, namely, color based HSV histogram, color R-HoG, and color Gabor, are explored using Naive Bayes (Probabilistic view), Euclidean and Chebyshev distance (Proximity view) and Gentle, Modest and Real AdaBoost (Boosting algorithm).

This paper proposes sparse proximity based fingerprint matching methodology. The sparse representation based classification problem can be solved as representing the test sample in terms of training set with some sparse residual error which is solved through sparse coding problem. The sparse representation based classification methodology learns an over-complete dictionary using the discriminating features extracted from the training samples. The learned over-complete dictionary contains each column as the feature vector of one of the training samples. The key concept behind SRC is that if sufficient training samples are available for each class in training phase then it will be possible to represent test samples as a linear combination of training samples belonging to that particular class. Sparse proximity error is calculated for a test sample corresponding to dictionary of each class. The test sample is labeled with the class whose dictionary yields minimum reconstruction error. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher recognition accuracy in comparison with other state of the art methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Equal error rate; Fingerprint Recognition; Sparse proximity,Classification (of information); Errors; Pattern matching; Sampling; Equal error rate; Fingerprint matching; Fingerprint Recognition; Over-complete dictionaries; Recognition accuracy; Sparse proximity; Sparse representation based classifications; State-of-the-art methods; Palmprint recognition,,Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proceeding - IEEE Int.

This is directly related to solving recognition problem for dynamic texture. Recognizing dynamic texture has become a fundamental problem to understand natural video content. It is a powerful technique for recognizing natural scenes such as fire, waves and smoke. Methods which exist today suffer from various problems such as camera motion, varying illumination etc. To solve these problems, we propose a deep learning based method, which have shown considerable success in image classification. One of the major requirements for using deep-learning techniques is a large dataset which is not available for dynamic texture. Hence, in this paper, we have given our own dataset divided over 11 categories with each category consisting of atleast 50 videos. We have used a pre-trained CNN model which is fine tuned on our dataset to extract features and use it as an input to SVM/Random Forest classifiers.

In general, fMRI records a combination of neural activation signals and several other noisy components. Alternatively, fMRI data is represented as a high dimensional array using a number of voxels, time instants, and snapshots. The organisation of fMRI data includes a number of Region Of Interests (ROI), snapshots, and thousand of voxels. The crucial step in cognitive task classification is a reduction of feature size through feature selection. Extraction of a specific pattern of interest within the noisy components is a challenging task. Tensor decomposition techniques have found several applications in the scientific fields. In this paper, a novel tensor gradient-based feature extraction technique for cognitive task classification is proposed. The technique has efficiently been applied on StarPlus fMRI data.

The performance of these wavelets was evaluated through fourteen distinct single and simultaneous PQ events which were generated following IEEE Std. 1159. Further, to investigate the interaction between induction algorithm and wavelet basis, two induction algorithms were included: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB). The results of the investigation convincingly demonstrate that 'db18' from the Daubechies family provides the best overall performance among 110 wavelet bases included in this study. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; power quality; signal processing; wavelet basis selection; wavelet packet transform,Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Nearest neighbor search; Power quality; Signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Daubechies; Induction algorithms; K-nearest neighbors; Naive bayes; Power quality event; Wavelet basis; Wavelet basis selection; Wavelet packet transforms; Wavelet transforms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044208985

The filter based approach is independent of the nature of induction algorithms used for the classification purposes and therefore offers several advantages over other approaches such as wrappers. This property of filter approach has been exploited in this study to obtain a generic feature subset that can be used with any induction algorithm. For this purpose, fourteen distinct single and simultaneous PQ events were simulated following IEEE Std. 1159. The feature selection of these events is accomplished through a combination of meta-heuristic search method and correlation based feature evaluation. Two meta-heuristic search methods based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) have been included for the comparison of search performance. The efficacy of reduced feature subsets is evaluated through induction algorithm based on Naive-Bayes. The results convincingly demonstrated that it is possible to obtain significant reduction in the features (approx. 50% with GA, 86% with BPSO) without any compromise in the classification performance. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Dimensionality Reduction; Feature Correlation; Feature Selection; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning; Particle Swarm Optimization; Power Quality,Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Modular robots; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power quality; Binary particle swarm optimization; Classification performance; Dimensionality reduction; Feature correlation; Induction algorithms; Meta-heuristic search; Power quality event; Search performance; Feature extraction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044226516

It considered as one of the widely accepted technologies worldwide. During these days people to avoid the expense of IT infrastructure and maintenance they are started adopting the cloud services. When we choose cloud service security is most significant obstacle and data security is biggest hurdle in case of security. When data is store on servers it may store directly or with encryption of whole data. But we know data have different characteristics and needs so different security levels are required. So in this paper we review some classification algorithms to classify the data on basis of their different security needs. After classification which part required more security that can be encrypted by various cryptographic techniques and then store it over the cloud whereas other part can store directly without any encryption on cloud storage. For further security we can partition the cloud storage. And this will help us to overcome the security issue i.e. confidentiality and also save our efforts and time of encryption and uploading of data over data storage. It prevents the data leakage also because after classification hacker will also not able to know the starting and ending point of data and it will also difficult for him to hack multiple storage than single.

A hybrid classifier algorithm is developed by merging Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms which will classify the Fitness data set. The nature of the data set is such that the classification accuracy does not reach the desired levels with individual classifiers but when classification is carried out with the hybrid classifier the classification accuracy is enhanced by 15.79% as compared to Decision Tree and 3.6% when compared with Naïve Bayes classifier.

But still Web pages are observed unstructured, semi-structured or asynchronous, which contains excess irrelevant information like advertisement, sponsored links, headers, footers etc. Hence guiding on to fetch particular documents over the Internet is well supported by search engines, on giving appropriate keywords in form of queries, or either by catalogues generation, which organize documents into hierarchical file structure. But maintenance of such catalogues manually is more difficult, due to the huge data residing on the Web; hence it becomes necessary build some techniques for auto-categorization of documents.

The best way to improve the patient’s chances for survival is the early detection of potentially cancerous cells. But, the conventional systems fails to segment the cancerous cells of various types namely, well-circumscribed, juxta-pleural, juxta-vascular and pleural-tail at its early stage (i.e., less than 3 mm) that leads to less classification accuracy. It is also noted that none of the existing systems achieved accuracy more than 98%. In this paper, we propose an optimal diagnosis system not only for early detection of lung cancer nodules and also to improve the accuracy in Fog computing environment. The Fog environment is used for storage of the high volume CT scanned images to achieve high privacy, low latency and mobility support. In our approach, for the accurate segmentation of Region of Interest (ROI), the hybrid technique namely Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and region growing segmentation algorithms are used. Then, the important features of the nodule of interest such as geometric, texture and statistical or intensity features are extracted. From the above extracted features, the optimal features used for the classification of lung cancer are identified using the Cuckoo search optimization algorithm. Finally, the SVM classifier is trained using these optimal features, which in turn helps us to classify the lung cancer as either of type benign or malignant. The accuracy of the proposed system is tested using Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP) public database CT lung images. The total sensitivity and specificity attained in our system for the above said database are 98.13 and 98.79% respectively. This results in a mean accuracy of 98.51% for training and testing in a sample of 103 nodules occurring in 50 exams. The rate of false positives per exam was 0.109.

In this big data era, the unpredictable flow and huge quantity of data brings new challenges in FPM such as space and time complexity. In general, most of the research work focus on recognizing the patterns that occurs frequently, from the set of specific data, where the patterns within every transaction were definitely known a priori. Among these, the users focus only on the small part of this FP. In order to tackle such problems in the current scenario, it is necessary sometimes to select the important features alone, using appropriate FPM algorithms, in order to reduce the complexity level. The major objective of this work is to improve FPM mining results and improve classification accuracy of big dataset samples. To tackle the first challenge, the levy flight bat algorithm (LFBA) along with online feature selection (OFS) approach is proposed, which is used to filter the low quality features from the big data in an online manner. Subsequently to address the second challenge, a weighted entropy frequent pattern mining (WEFPM) is enforced for FPM, to accomplish better computation time when compared with other methods such as direct discriminative pattern mining (DDPMine) and iterative sampling based frequent itemset mining (ISbFIM), where enumeration of entire feature combinations were completed. So the WEFPM algorithm employed in this paper, targets to identify only the specific frequent patterns which are required by the user. By iterating this procedure, it assures that the acquired frequent patterns can be enumerated by using both the theoretical and empirical research, so that enumeration doesn’t proceed into a combinatorial explosion. And also, using the above said LFBA–OFS approach and WEFPM algorithm, frequent patterns that are different in nature, are generated for building high quality learning model. For finding the frequent patterns, here the minimum support threshold is matched with entropy. As a final step, multiple Kernel learning support vector machine is employed as a classifier, to evaluate the performance of the big data samples for efficiency and accuracy. Empirical study reveal that considerable progress is obtained in terms of accuracy and computation time when applied to UCI benchmark big datasets, using the proposed approach for efficient and effective FPM of the online features. It is clear that WEFPM is the most efficient method, because it produces higher average accuracy results of 92.34, 93.218, 91.374 and 87.87% values for adult, chess, hybo and sick dataset respectively.

Though qualitative analysis of intracranial recordings from the patients involves cumbersome procedure, it provides significant neuronal activities of the brain that is essential for clinical decision making. Methods This study considered three epileptic seizures stages, namely, pre-ictal (set C), post-ictal (set D) and epileptic (set E) iEEG from the University of Bonn, Germany database. Four entropies, Shannon, log energy, spectral and Renyi entropies were considered as features to evaluate MLP-NN network. Four classification tasks with the dataset were formed, namely CE, DE, CDE, and CD. In order to identify the optimal configuration of MLP-NN for classification, network parameters such as input-hidden layer activation/transfer functions, hidden-output layer activation/transfer functions, network training/learning functions, the number of hidden neurons were considered and the optimality was arrived based on the mean square error (MSE), classification accuracy (CA). The efficiency of the entropy features was exploited by the parameters, mutual range of coefficient (?), p-value, and z-score, which showed the band discrimination for various classification tasks. Results Simulations results showed that the tan sigmoid, pure linear were found to be optimal input-hidden, hidden-output transfer function and Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm as optimal training function for all the four classification tasks. It was inferred from the proposed study that the CA indirectly varies with ? value, p value, and MSE, and directly varies with z-score. From the experimental study, the best CA of 97.68%, 94.56%, 84.58%, and 57.8% was obtained for case CE, DE, CDE, and CD respectively.

Most of the existing models use word level embeddings for the final classification of the sentiments. This paper proposes a novel representation of short text derived from a combination of word embeddings and character embeddings using Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). Along with this, we use attention mechanism that learns to focus on sentiment specific words. Robust representation of short text can be applied for sentiment classification as well as predicting intensity of sentiments.

In past, Identity of a person verified by traditional token-based or knowledge-based system but in recent year's bio-metrics traits like face, finger, iris, palm print etc. become a key technology for identity verification. Palm print is also the one bio-metric trait that can be used for the efficient identification. Palm print contains many unique features like principal lines, points, ridges, textures etc. that can differentiate two person. Because palm is a large area of hand, there is a common problem of palm displacement over scanner that results in increase in false rejection rate. This paper proposed a method which first generates ROI of captured palm image then median filtering is applied to remove noise and increasing edge sharpness. Histogram equalization applied after that for contrast stretching for low resolution images. Enhanced image is then divided in sixteen equal part, texture feature is extracted from each part of image separately using different orientations of Gabor filter. The generated feature vectors of all sixteen images are then normalized to a single feature vector using n bin histogram process. This increase acceptance rate in case if palm is placed over scanner in slightly different angles because working on small areas of palm helps to extract detail features. This paper used SVM for classification of generated feature vector and Experiment performed on polyU palm print database [1]. © 2017 IEEE.",Biometrics; Gabor Filter; Palm Print,Bandpass filters; Biometrics; Classification (of information); Gabor filters; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Image processing; Knowledge based systems; Median filters; Scanning; Contrast stretching; False rejection rate; Histogram equalizations; Identity verification; Low resolution images; Median filtering; Palmprints; Texture features; Palmprint recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This field is challenging as there may be mixture of emotions and to classify them, no well defined standards are available. Due to present life style 'Stress' is experienced by everybody, everyday either mild or intense. Stress is a silent killer in medical terms. Stress can exacerbate mood disorders like anxiety, fear, and depression. Overload of work, targets, nature of work, night shifts are the parameters mostly affecting Information technology (IT) professionals. It develops hypertension and diabetes resulting in depression and alcohol consumption. Stress or anxiety may result in shaky voice, stuttering voice and linguistic problem. Early detection of symptoms will reduce these cases. In India this problem is seen in 68% of IT professionals.

This research paper proposes a novel image processing technique that includes two phases depicts an optimized selection of feature extraction and classification algorithm that enhances the quality, exactness of the seed variety and realization of the most excellent classification production percentage of 98.9%. In the identification and classification phase, image representation of the pulse seed varieties is pre-processed to enhance the seed image with S-component Conversion and the escalated seed image is processed to detect the outer boundary of the seed and also the inner region of the pulse seed image is extracted for the more accurate and closed boundaries to detect and fill the inner holes of the pulse seed image. This proposed algorithm employed with extraction of 256 features by evaluating the shape, color, texture and seed specialized features. And to attain significant features selection by weighting and ranking techniques for the particular varietal classification. In the second phase, the quality determination of the pulse seed is established to find good viability condition of seed using thermal imaging techniques. The quality aspects are estimating water content in the seed, germination level, and vigorness of the seed and trueness of the seed. In our proposed work average utilization time for processing of identification and classification for each seed is 0.21s. Findings: This work implemented two main phases: Pulse seed Identification and classification and Pulse Quality Determination. In Phase-I, the seed image is acquisitioned and pre-processed by image enhancement and noise removal. Then the enhanced image is processed to detect the inner and outer region of the seed image for the identification process. Then features are extracted from the segmented image for the classification of the pulse seed variety.

As it is required to discuss about the issue of supervised Land-cover classification of multispectral satellite images in the perspective of cluster ensemble and self learning. Different information partitions inferred by several clustering methods which are gathered into a better solution by cluster ensembles. supervised iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) method can be initialized by cluster ensemble based strategy which will be examined in the paper. This will deliver better approximation of cluster parameters. Here definition of Land-cover classes is vital. Another method for producing suitable labeling model for each and every clustering of the consensus is introduced for cluster ensembles. The upgraded parameter set acquired from the EM step is trained by maximum likely-hood classifier to classify the rest of the pixels. The effect of data overlapping from several clusters can be reduced by the self learning classifier.

We dealt with binary classification data and hence the data modelling problem involves the computation of two decision boundaries of which one related with that of kernel learning and the other with that of input data. In our approach, they are found with the aid of a single cost function by constructing a global reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as the direct sum of the RKHSs corresponding to the decision boundaries of kernel learning and input data and searching that function from the global RKHS, which can be represented as the direct sum of the decision boundaries under consideration. In our experimental analysis, the proposed model had shown superior performance in comparison with that of existing two stage function approximation formulation of MKL, where the decision functions of kernel learning and input data are found separately using two different cost functions. This is due to the fact that single stage representation helps the knowledge transfer between the computation procedures for finding the decision boundaries of kernel learning and input data, which inturn boosts the generalisation capacity of the model. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",classification; function approximation; Multiple kernel learning; online learning; support vector machine,Bins; Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Input output programs; Knowledge management; Support vector machines; Binary classification; Binary classification problems; Experimental analysis; Function approximation; Multiple Kernel Learning; Online learning; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Supervised classification; Classification (of information),"Sumitra, S.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: sumitra@iist.ac.in",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,207721,,IJSYA,,English,Int.

Four tools that expose traces of semantic manipulation based on specific statistical cues are designed that work cohesively to allow detection of forgeries in single image (copy-move), composite image (splicing) and two generic artefacts (double JPEG compression and noise inconsistency). The measurement level fusion of tool outcome is carried out with Sugneo and Choquet integrals as the underlying aggregation operators.

When a huge number of research proposals are received, it is common to group them along with their similarities in research discipline areas. Then the grouped proposals are assigned to the appropriate experts for peer review. Existing approaches are not efficient to classify the document of project proposal correctly. Text-mining methods are used to solve the problem of classifying text documents automatically. In this paper, research proposals are classified based on the discipline areas and proposals in each discipline are grouped using the text-mining technique. Dice’s coefficient, Damerau–Levenshtein distance, Tversky index, Cosine similarity and Jaro–Winkler distance are used to find the similarity between the documents. The classification is used to predict the target class for each document proposal in the dataset accurately. In this work, Proposed Ensemble classifiers are used that contain various classifiers such as Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naïve Bayes.

An adversarial exploitation of published data poses a risk of information disclosure about individuals. On the other hand, imposing privacy constraints on the data results in substantial information loss and compromises the legitimate data analysis. Motivated by the increasing growth of PPDM algorithms, we first investigate the privacy implications and the crosscutting issues between privacy versus utility of data. We present a privacy model that embeds the anonymization procedure in to a learning algorithm and this has mitigated the additional overheads imposed on data mining tasks. Our primary concern about PPDM is that the utility of data should not be compromised by the transformation applied.

The identification of individual cattle is an important issue for classification of different breads, their registration, traceability, health management, and verification of false insurance claim throughout the world. To solve these major problems, the muzzle (nose) point image pattern of cattle is a suitable and primary biometric characteristic for the recognition of cattle. The recognition of muzzle point images is similar to the recognition of minutiae points in the human fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature extraction approach for the automatic recognition and classification of cattle breeds based on captured muzzle point image pattern features using low- cost camera. The major contributions of this research is based on following aspects: (1) preparation of muzzle point image dataset, (2) extraction of salient set of features and (3) K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), Fuzzy-KNN, Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes classification models are applied to recognition, and classification of individual cattle using their muzzle point pattern. This paper, therefore, demonstrates the automatic recognition and classification of livestock using the set of extracted muzzle point image features.

Modelling of the emotion recognition process serves to understand as well as assess the performance of the system. This paper compares two different models for speech emotion recognition using vocal tract features namely, the first four formants and their respective bandwidths. The first model is based on a decision tree and the second one employs logistic regression. Whereas the decision tree models are based on machine learning, regression models have a strong statistical basis. The logistic regression models and the decision tree models developed in this work for several cases of binary classifications were validated by speech emotion recognition experiments conducted on a Malayalam emotional speech database of 2800 speech files, collected from ten speakers. The models are not only simple, but also meaningful since they indicate the contribution of each predictor. The experimental results indicate that speech emotion recognition using formants and bandwidths was better modelled using decision trees, which gave higher emotion recognition accuracies compared to logistic regression. The highest accuracy obtained using decision tree was 93.63%, for the classification of positive valence emotional speech as surprised or happy, using seven features. When using logistic regression for the same binary classification, the highest accuracy obtained was 73%, with eight features. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Decision trees; Logistic regression; Modelling; Speech emotion recognition,Bandwidth; Binary trees; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Fisher information matrix; Learning systems; Models; Regression analysis; Speech; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Trees (mathematics); Binary classification; Decision tree models; Emotion recognition; Emotional speech; Logistic regression models; Logistic regressions; Regression model; Speech emotion recognition; Speech recognition,"Jacob, A.; Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation, Government Engineering CollegeIndia; email: agneswills3@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13812416,,ISTEF,,English,Int J Speech Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029584048

Several countermeasures to thwart such analysis have been also proposed in the related cryptographic literature. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel combination of power and fault analysis strategies to devise attacks against such protected implementations of Grain stream cipher. We considered clock glitch induced faults occurring in practice to construct our fault model. In addition, we developed a generic power analysis attack technique against the Grain family of stream ciphers assuming that the cipher implementation can be resynchronized multiple times with a fixed secret key and any randomly generated initialization vector. Subsequently, we combine our proposed power analysis strategy with the notion of the practically occurring faults to mount attacks on various fault attack countermeasures. In order to validate our proposed power analysis attack, we report the results of power trace classifications of a Grain v1 implementation on SASEBO-GII board. The captured power traces were analyzed using least squares support vector machine learning algorithm-based multiclass classifiers to segregate the power traces into the respective Hamming distance (HD) classes. To extract power samples with high information about HD classes, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric was chosen for feature selection. The experimental results of power trace classifications of test set showed success rate as high as 92.5% when the seven largest SNR sample instants over a clock cycle were chosen as features along with a suitable kernel hyperparameter combination. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Clock glitch; differential power analysis; fault attack countermeasures; Grain stream cipher; least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM); SASEBO-GII board,Classification (of information); Clocks; Cryptography; Hamming distance; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Signal to noise ratio; Support vector machines; Differential power Analysis; Fault attack countermeasures; Least squares support vector machines; SASEBO-GII; Stream Ciphers; Side channel attack,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2780070,,ITCSD,,English,IEEE Trans Comput Aided Des Integr Circuits Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040672575

Accurate motion states estimation and the target representation in visual tracking system are based on the appearances of the target. The factor affects the learning of target representation is the accumulated error due to the pose, illumination changes, and the uneven background. The presence of dynamic background and the shadowing effects causes the visual drift and destructive information. Besides, the misclassification of target region induces the false detection of moving objects. The K-means and Fuzzy-C-means clustering algorithms are available to segment the foreground/background and suppress the shadow region on the basis of the non-changing background of the surveillance area. This paper proposes the novel background normalization technique with textural pattern analysis to suppress the shadow region. The Neighborhood Chain Prediction (NCP) algorithm is used to cluster the uneven background and the Differential Boundary Pattern (DBP) extracts the texture of the video frame to suppress the shadow pixels present in the frame. The lower intensity estimation and the prediction of the area around the lower intensity in proposed work enhance the pixels for shadow removal. The shadow-free frame split up into several grids and the histograms of features are extracted from the grid formatted frame. Finally, the Machine Level Classification (MLC) finds the matching grid corresponds to the tracking region and provides the binary labeling to separate the background and foreground. The proposed DBP-based visual tracking system is high robustness over the sudden illumination changes and the dynamic background due to the texture pattern analysis. The comparison of proposed NCP-DBP combination with the existing segmentation techniques regarding the accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, success and error rate assured the effectiveness in visual tracking applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Binary labeling; Boundary pattern; Classification; Clustering; Computer vision; Object tracking,Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Computer control systems; Computer vision; Fuzzy clustering; Image processing; Object detection; Pixels; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Background normalization; Boundary patterns; Clustering; Computer vision applications; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Object Tracking; Segmentation techniques; Visual tracking systems; Visual servoing,"Mohanapriya, D.; Department of Computer Applications, Alagappa UniversityIndia; email: mohanapriya.researchscholar@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014627969

In this paper, we propose an efficient CAD system to classify pathological and healthy brains using brain MR images. The suggested pathological brain detection system (PBDS) has the ability to help radiologists to initiate the corrective measures for treating the ailing patients at an early stage. The proposed scheme uses a simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN) for the region of interest (ROI) segmentation and fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT) for feature extraction. Subsequently, PCA+LDA approach is harnessed for feature dimensionality reduction and finally probabilistic neural network (PNN) is applied for classification. The scheme is validated on various standard datasets and compared with existing competent schemes with respect to classification accuracy and number of features. The statistical set up is kept similar as reported in the recent literature to derive an unbiased analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested scheme yields higher accuracy as compared to others with considerably less number of features. The number of parameters need to be tuned at different stages are significantly less in contrast to existing schemes. Further, PNN used has a simple network structure and offers faster learning speed. Therefore, the proposed scheme can effectively detect pathological brain in real-time and hence has a potential to be installed on medical robots. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD); Fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); PCA+LDA; Probabilistic neural network (PNN); Pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN),Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT); PCA+LDA; Probabilistic neural networks; Pulse coupled neural network; Computer aided diagnosis,"Nayak, D.R.; Pattern Recognition Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 769 008, India; email: depakranjannayak@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021979257

With the information explosion of different learning algorithms and the changing data scenarios, there is a need of smart learning system. The paper shows one approach where past experiences learned are used to suggest the best suitable learner using 3 meta-features namely simple, statistical and information theoretic features. The system tests 38 UCI benchmark datasets from various domains using nine classifiers from various categories. It is observed that for 29 datasets, i.e., 76 % of datasets, both the predicted and actual accuracies directly match. The proposed approach is found to be correct for algorithm selection of these datasets. New proposed equation of finding classifier accuracy based on meta-features is determined and validated.

It is a two-stage classifier that uses maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to maximize posterior probabilities of classification map obtained in first stage to incorporate spatial information for better classification accuracy. Two different forms of compatibility coefficients based on correlation and mutual information are used for MAP estimation. The initial probability estimates are obtained from probabilistic support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The combination of SVM with MAP estimation is investigated and compared with benchmark Markov random field and extended morphological profile-based approaches and some other recent methods. The experimental results are presented for three airborne hyperspectral images. The results reveal that incorporation of contextual information with both forms of compatibility coefficients statistically significantly improved SVM results.

The widespread popularity of imagery applications and the advent of powerful and inexpensive cameras are among the numerous reasons that have contributed to this upward spike in the reach of image manipulation. A considerable number of features – including numerous texture features – have been proposed by various researchers for identifying image forgery. However, detecting forgery in images utilizing texture-based features have not been explored to its full potential – especially a thorough evaluation of the texture features have not been proposed. In this paper, features based on image textures are extracted and combined in a specific way to detect the presence of image forgery. First, the input image is converted to YCbCr color space to extract the chroma channels. Gabor Wavelets and Local Phase Quantization are subsequently applied to these channels to extract the texture features at different scales and orientations. These features are then optimized using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This method leads to the classification of images with accuracies of 99.33%, 96.3%, 97.6%, 85%, and 96.36% for the CASIA v2.0, CASIA v1.0, CUISDE, IFS-TC and Unisa TIDE datasets respectively showcasing its ability to identify image forgeries under varying conditions.

The objective is to explore the potency of syntax based linguistic features extracted using shallow natural language processing techniques for plagiarism classification task. Shallow syntactic features, viz., part of speech tags and chunks are utilized after effective pre-processing and filtrations for pruning the irrelevant information. The work further proposes the modelling of this classification phase as an intermediate stage, which will be post candidate source retrieval and before exhaustive passage level detections. A two-phase feature selection approach is proposed, which improves the effectiveness of classification by selecting appropriate set of features as the input to machine learning based classifiers. The proposed approach is evaluated on smaller and larger test conditions using the corpus of plagiarized short answers (PSA) and plagiarism instances collected from PAN corpus respectively. Under both the test conditions, performances are evaluated using general as well as advanced classification metrics. Another main contribution of the current work is the analysis of dependencies and impact of the extracted features, upon the type and complexity of plagiarism imposed in the documents. The proposed results are compared with the two state-of-the-art approaches and they outperform the baseline approaches significantly.

It has been observed that the ideal balancing ratio has yielded better performance than the imbalanced dataset, but it was not the best as compared to some intermediate ratio.

This non-deterministic nature of algorithms such as the K-Means clustering algorithm limits their applicability in areas such as cancer subtype prediction using gene expression data. It is hard to sensibly compare the results of such algorithms with those of other algorithms. The non-deterministic nature of K-Means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroids. Method We propose an improved, density based version of K-Means, which involves a novel and systematic method for selecting initial centroids. The key idea of the algorithm is to select data points which belong to dense regions and which are adequately separated in feature space as the initial centroids. Results We compared the proposed algorithm to a set of eleven widely used single clustering algorithms and a prominent ensemble clustering algorithm which is being used for cancer data classification, based on the performances on a set of datasets comprising ten cancer gene expression datasets. The proposed algorithm has shown better overall performance than the others. Conclusion There is a pressing need in the Biomedical domain for simple, easy-to-use and more accurate Machine Learning tools for cancer subtype prediction. The proposed algorithm is simple, easy-to-use and gives stable results. Moreover, it provides comparatively better predictions of cancer subtypes from gene expression data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cancer subtype prediction; Centroid initialization; Clustering; Density based; Gene expression data; K-Means,"Classification (of information); Diseases; Forecasting; Gene expression; Learning systems; Cancer subtypes; Centroid initializations; Clustering; Density-based; Gene Expression Data; K-means; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; Article; brain tumor; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; comparative study; consensus; data base; density; gene expression; K means clustering; medulloblastoma; prediction; priority journal; cluster analysis; gene expression profiling; genetic database; genetics; human; metabolism; neoplasm; procedures; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Neoplasms","Nidheesh, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology CalicutIndia; email: nidheesh.n@nitc.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,29100115,English,Comput.

Broadly, the review work is dichotomized into feature extraction methods with and without noise compensation techniques. Feature extraction methods without noise compensation techniques are divided into following categories: On the basis of high/low level of feature extraction; type of transform; speech production/auditory system; type of feature extraction technique; time variability; speech processing techniques. Further, feature extraction methods with noise compensation techniques are classified into noise-screened features, feature normalization methods, feature compensation methods.

This paper presents a feature selection-based hybrid-bagging algorithm (FS-HB) for improved credit risk evaluation. The 2 feature selection methods chi-square and principal component analysis were used for ranking and selecting the important features from the datasets. The classifiers were built on 5 training and test data partitions of the input data set. The performance of the hybrid algorithm was compared with that of the standalone classifiers: feature selection-based classifiers and bagging. The hybrid FS-HB algorithm performed best for qualitative dataset with less features and tree-based unstable base classifier. Its performance on numeric data was also better than other standalone classifiers, whereas comparable to bagging with only selected features. Its performance was found better on 70:30 data partition and the type II error, which is very significant in risk evaluation was also reduced significantly. The improved performance of FS-HB is attributed to the important features used for developing the classifier thereby reducing the complexity of the algorithm and the use of ensemble methodology, which added to the classical bias variance trade-off and performed better than standalone classifiers.

The training data is prepared by randomly selecting some text sentences from the large corpus of financial text. Conventionally, bootstrapping algorithm is used to annotate large volume of unlabeled data by learning from a small set of annotated data. However, the small set of annotated data have to be carefully chosen as seed data. Thus, our approach is a digress from the conventional approach of bootstrapping as we let the users randomly select the seed data. We show that our proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 73.56% in classifying the financial texts into the different categories (“Accounting”, “Cost”, “Employee”, “Financing”, “Sales”, “Investments”, “Operations”, “Profit”, “Regulations” and “Irrelevant”) even when the training data is just 30% of the total data set. Additionally, the accuracy improves by an approximate average of 2% for an increase of the training data by 10% and the accuracy of our system is 77.91% when the training data is about 50% of the total data set. As a dictionary of hand chosen keywords prepared by domain experts are often used for financial text extraction, we assumed the existence of almost linearly separable hyperplanes between the different classes and therefore, we have used Linear Support Vector Machine along with a modified version of Label Propagation Algorithm which exploits the notion of neighborhood (in Euclidean space) for classification.

The method simultaneously optimizes two feature selection criteria, namely, set approximation accuracy of rough set theory and relational algebra based derived score, in order to select the most relevant feature subset from an entire feature set. Superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods is confirmed by experimental results, which is conducted over seven publicly available benchmark datasets of different characteristics such as a low number of objects with a high number of features, and a high number of objects with a low number of features. © 2017.

There are multiple benchmark algorithms based on filter, wrapper and hybrid methods. These algorithms adopt different techniques which vary from traditional search-based techniques to more advanced nature inspired algorithm based techniques. In this paper, a hybrid feature selection algorithm using graph-based technique has been proposed. The proposed algorithm has used the concept of Feature Association Map (FAM) as an underlying foundation. It has used graph-theoretic principles of minimal vertex cover and maximal independent set to derive feature subset. This algorithm applies to both supervised and unsupervised classification. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with several benchmark supervised and unsupervised feature selection algorithms and found to be better than them. Also, the proposed algorithm is less computationally expensive and hence has taken less execution time for the publicly available datasets used in the experiments, which include high-dimensional datasets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Clustering; Feature selection; Graph theory,Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Graph theory; Clustering; High dimensional datasets; Hybrid feature selections; Maximal independent set; Nature inspired algorithms; Supervised and unsupervised classification; Unsupervised classification; Unsupervised feature selection; Feature extraction,"Das, A.K.; A.K.

The aim of this study was to introduce a robust method that can automatically identify alcoholic EEG signals based on time–frequency (T–F) image information as they convey key characteristics of EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method to classify automatically the alcoholic and control EEG signals. The proposed scheme is based on time–frequency images, texture image feature extraction and nonnegative least squares classifier (NNLS). In T–F analysis, the spectrogram of the short-time Fourier transform is considered. The obtained T–F images are then converted into 8-bit grayscale images. Co-occurrence of the histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) and Eig(Hess)-CoHOG features are extracted from T–F images. Finally, obtained features are fed into NNLS classifier as input for classify alcoholic and control EEG signals. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we replace the NNLS classifier by artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine classifier separately, with the same features. Experimental outcomes along with comparative evaluations with the state-of-the-art algorithms manifest that the proposed method outperforms competing algorithms. The experimental outcomes are promising, and it can be anticipated that upon its implementation in clinical practice, the proposed scheme will alleviate the onus of the physicians and expedite neurological diseases diagnosis and research. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Alcoholism; Classification; Electroencephalogram; Feature extraction; Nonnegative least squares classifier; Texture image; Time–frequency images,Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Discriminant analysis; Electroencephalography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image texture; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Alcoholism; Frequency image; Histograms of oriented gradients; Linear discriminant analysis; Nonnegative least squares; Short time Fourier transforms; Support vector machine classifiers; Texture image; Biomedical signal processing,"Bajaj, V.; Discipline of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and ManufacturingIndia; email: bajajvarun056@yahoo.co.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

This paper proposes a new method of crop classification in which fusion of spectral, spatial and vegetation indices is used as the feature set to overcome the limitation of spectral similarity problem.

The applications of classification problems has increased so rapidly that the need for efficient and accurate classifiers has become a vital requirement in the area of data mining. Multi-label classification problem is distinguished from the single label classification because of the capability to handle multiple labels. In this paper, we put forward a good method to predict the multiple labels of an unlabeled instance by using apriori algorithm. The proposed solution MLCA is able to find unknown labels for any test instance by checking for the presence of particular set of attributes, along with their discretized values. MLC-A intends to employ Apriori algorithm for multi-label classification purpose, in contrast, to the well known existing methods. Apriori algorithm is utilized to find the relationship between attributes and labels by generating rules. The generated rules will find the occurrence of a label given the existence of various attributes. The experimental results on datasets of yeast, scene and emotions had given excellent accuracy. Using MLC-A the time complexity has reduced to a great extend.

The algorithm employed there, modeled the intrusion signal as a linear combination of chirplets. The extracted chirplet-based features were fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification. This resulted in a platform that, under the tested conditions, resulted in high classification accuracy, in excess of 95%. The current paper is aimed at determining the extent to which the classification accuracy could be attributed to the use of the algorithm employed. Fifteen different algorithms for intrusion detection and classification are examined in the current paper, these operate on a database that builds on top of the earlier database. These fifteen algorithms correspond to the different possible pairings obtained by selecting from among 5 feature-vectors and 3 classifiers. The results show that the chirplet-based feature extractor to play a major role in achieving high-accuracy classification, easily beating the performance of the other feature extractors, particularly in terms of the more challenging task of separating intrusion from vegetative clutter.

These features are in terms of numerical vectors which are used to train decision trees, neural networks, k-nn and Naive Bayes. The chosen text and authors are of the same period and same genre. Using the proposed algorithm, high accuracy rate can be achieved. While training and testing a classifier, features play an important role. The number of features can have both positive and negative impacts on accuracy rate. Therefore, a set of features are required which can provide high accuracy rate. This set can vary for different classification algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Decision trees; K-NN; Naive-bayes; Neural networks; Stylometric features,Classifiers; Decision trees; Electronic mail; Forestry; Information retrieval systems; Neural networks; Syntactics; Text processing; Classification algorithm; Email classification; Fraud detection; Naive bayes; Punctuation marks; Sentence length; Stylometric features; Training and testing; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This perhaps is due to the use of inappropriate descriptors during the feature extraction stage. In this paper, a Radon Transform is used as an iris signature descriptor. Blood vessels are segmented from iris image. After blood vessel segmentation, the radon transform is applied on the segmented image. The GLCM, Gabor and Local Binary Patterns are used for feature extraction. Well known SVM classifier is used for classification of the iris data. The performance of the system is evaluated on DRIVE and High Resolution Image Databases. The system performs better for the radon transform signature. This proposed approach of iris recognition using blood vessel segmentation is robust and secure and has the ability to recognize retinal images from the photographs of the known iris images. The system is more efficient in terms of accuracy as well as time complexity. The GLCM features when applied on Radon signatures gives improved results for both datasets of DRIVE and HRF. © 2017 IEEE.",Blood vessel segmentatio; Gabor; GLCM; Local binary pattern; Radon transform; SVM,Bins; Biometrics; Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Digital storage; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Mathematical transformations; Blood vessel segmentation; Feature extraction stages; Gabor; GLCM; High resolution image; Local binary patterns; Radon Transform; Signature descriptor; Blood vessels,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

MRI is the commonly used modality for the diagnosis of brain tumor. Brain tumor image classification is one of the fundamental problem faced by the clinicians and doctors who worked in this field. In this paper, we proposed a robust method for MR brain image classification based on fractal dimensions (FD). Brain tumor increases the intracranial pressure (ICP) inside the brain and changes the normal structure of the human brain. This structural changes can be effectively characterized by using fractal dimension analysis. Fractal dimension is a commonly used measure to detect the irregularity of a structure. Brain tumor also causes changes in the regular structure of tissues such as gray matter and white matter in the human brain. We analyzed this irregularity for image classification. In the first stage, input MR brain images are preprocessed using mathematical morphology based operations. In the second stage, we extracted the gray matter and white matter of tumored and non-tumored MR brain images separately by using fuzzy c-means clustering method. In the final stage, the fractal dimension of gray matter and white matter is computed. We found that the presence of tumors can cause significant changes in the fractal dimension of gray matter and white matter of the human brain. We used this variation in the fractal dimension for the classification of MR brain images into tumored and non tumored images. © 2017 IEEE.",Brain Image Classification; Fractal Dimension (FD); Gray Matter (GM); MRI; White Matter (WM),Brain; Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Diagnosis; Finite difference method; Fractals; Histology; Image analysis; Image classification; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical morphology; Tissue; Tumors; Brain images; Fractal dimension analysis; Fuzzy c-means clustering method; Gray matter; Intracranial pressure; Regular structure; Robust classification; White matter; Fractal dimension,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This had shown astonishing performance in sentence and document modeling. To leverage this, we use LSTM network to the encrypted text categorization at character and word level of texts. These texts are transformed in to dense word-vectors by using bag-of-words embedding. Dense word vectors are fed in to recurrent layers to capture the contextual information and followed by dense and activation layer with nonlinear activation function such as softmax for classification. The optimal network architecture has found by conducting various experiments with varying network parameters and network structures. All the experiments are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5]. Most of the LSTM network structures substantially performed well in 5-fold cross-validation. Based on the 5-fold cross-validation results, we claim that the character level inputs are more efficient in dealing with the encrypted texts in comparison to word level, due to the fact that character level input keeps more information from lowlevel textual representations. Character level based LSTM models achieved highest accuracy as 0.99 and the word level achieved highest accuracy as 0.94 in the classification settings of 5-fold cross validation using LSTM networks.

In real life applications, classifiers are applied on data sets which are unbalanced i.e. some classes having very less number of instances known as minority classes as compared to other classes known as majority classes. Classification algorithms are highly accurate for the majority classes but significantly less accurate for the minority classes. Unbalanced data sets have a negative effect on classification performance of traditional classification algorithms. Analyzing such problem is called class imbalance problem. To solve Class Imbalance Problem different techniques have been proposed at the Data level, Algorithm level and at the Hybrid level. Most commonly used data balancing techniques are over and under sampling for handling the class imbalance problem. In our paper we compare various oversampling techniques which are SMOTE (Synthetic minority oversampling approach), ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, Safe-Level SMOTE by applying different classifiers to the problem and observing various performance metrics. © 2017 IEEE.",ADASYN; BORDERLINE SMOTE; Class imbalance problem.; Oversampling; SAFE LEVEL SMOTE; SMOTE,Problem solving; ADASYN; BORDERLINE SMOTE; Class imbalance problems; Over sampling; SAFE LEVEL SMOTE; SMOTE; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Adopting a new and existing machine learning classifiers to NIDS has been a significant area in security research due to the fact that the enhancement in detection rate and accuracy is of important in large volume of security audit data including diverse and dynamic characteristics of attacks. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various shallow and deep networks to NIDS. The shallow and deep networks are trained and evaluated on the KDDCup '99' and NSL-KDD data sets in both binary and multi-class classification settings. The deep networks are performed well in comparison to the shallow networks in most of the experiment configurations. The main reason to this might be a deep network passes information through several layers to learn the underlying hidden patterns of normal and attack network connection records and finally aggregates these learned features of each layer together to effectively distinguish the normal and various attacks of network connection records. Additionally, deep networks have not only performed well in detecting and classifying the known attacks additionally in unknown attacks too. To achieve an acceptable detection rate, we used various configurations of network settings and its parameters in deep networks. All the various configurations of deep network are run up to 1000 epochs in training with a learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5] to effectively capture the time varying patterns of normal and various attacks. © 2017 IEEE.",Shallow and Deep networks,Classification (of information); Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Deep networks; Dynamic characteristics; Information and Communication Technologies; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-class classification; Network connection; Network intrusion detection systems; Time-varying patterns; Computer crime,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The quantum computing concept is used to decide the connection weights and threshold of neurons. A boundary threshold parameter is introduced to optimally determine the neuron threshold. This parameter uses min, max function to decide threshold, which assists efficient learning. A manually prepared signature dataset is used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. To uniquely identify the signature, several novel features are selected such as the number of loops present in the signature, the boundary calculation, the number of vertical and horizontal dense patches, and the angle measurement. A total of 45 features are extracted from each signature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by rigorous training and testing with these signatures using partitions of 60–40 and 70–30%, and a tenfold cross-validation. To compare the results derived from the proposed quantum neural network, the same dataset is tested on support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, back propagation neural network, and Naive Bayes.

While existing literature focuses on facial feature recognition for non-verbal communication, we propose using handshake patterns to classify the personality of the concerned human. Due to the largely random nature of the gestures in handshakes, general pattern recognition methods cannot be used to classify them effectively. This paper proposes to classify a handshake into two labels: dominant and submissive, by using the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm on apriori ranked statistical markers extracted from the training data. For the purpose of data acquisition, a wearable device attached to the wrist of the robot was designed. The wearable was fitted with a 9-axis accelerometer and a flex sensor. The training data consists of accelerometric data from handshakes with 12 different individuals, with each individual exhibiting both a dominant and submissive personality trait. Mutual Information and Statistical Dependence are used to rank statistical markers extracted from the training data. The best ranked features were used to classify the handshakes using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and classify the handshake into the two class labels. The proposed methodology classifies data with an accuracy of 75.0% when tested on 8 different handshakes. © 2017 IEEE.",,Cybernetics; Data acquisition; Human robot interaction; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Robots; Wearable technology; Facial feature; General patterns; K nearest neighbor algorithm; Mutual informations; Non-verbal communications; Personality traits; Statistical dependence; Wearable devices; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Emotion recognition from audio is an attractive option due to its non-obtrusive nature and availability of microphones in devices at the workplace. We describe building a classifier that analyzes the para-linguistic features of audio streams to classify them into positive, neutral and negative affect. Since speech at the workplace is different from acted speech, and because it is important that the training data be situated in the right context, we designed and executed an emotion induction procedure to generate a corpus of non-acted speech data of 33 speakers. The corpus was used to train a set of classification models and a comparative analysis of these models was used to choose the feature parameters. Bootstrap aggregation (bagging) was then used on the best combination of algorithm (Random Forest) and features (60 millisecond window size). The resulting classification accuracy of 73% is on par with, or exceeds, accuracies reported in the current literature for non-acted speech for a speaker-dependent test set.

One of the major usefulness of big data is found in the field of healthcare analytics. The healthcare data come from varied sources. Specifically EHR data provide a comprehensive view of patient's health. People are paying more attention to their health and want the best possible healthcare especially with new technologies evolving every now and then. We can analyze this astronomical patient's information and try to study certain patterns, which can give us the better understanding of the data present. In this study a neurological dataset of thousand patients has been collected from a hospital. Out of this data the particular cases of head injury are taken into account and specific attributes like pulse rate, blood pressure, Glasgow coma scale, respiratory rate, CNS are studied and analyzed. The analysis is performed on the basis of two factors: duration of patient's stay in the hospital and seriousness level of the injury. A classification model is prepared on the data and the implementation is carried out in R Programming, using its statistical packages and graphical abilities. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Data mining; EHR; Healthcare analytics; Pattern recognition,Big data; Blood pressure; Classification (of information); Data mining; Health care; Hospitals; Intelligent systems; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Glasgow coma scale; Head injuries; New technologies; Pulse rate; R programming; Respiratory rate; Statistical packages; Information management,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The high dimensional data sets generally comprise of irrelevant and redundant features also along with the relevant features which deteriorate the clustering result. Therefore, feature selection is necessary to select a subset of relevant features as it improves discrimination ability of the original set of features which helps in improving the clustering result. Though many metaheuristics have been suggested to select subset of the relevant features in wrapper framework based on some criteria, most of them are marred by the three key issues. First, they require objects class information a priori which is unknown in unsupervised feature selection. Second, feature subset selection is devised on a single validity measure; hence, it produces a single best solution biased toward the cardinality of the feature subset. Third, they find difficulty in avoiding local optima owing to lack of balancing in exploration and exploitation in the feature search space. To deal with the first issue, we use unsupervised feature selection method where no class information is required. To address the second issue, we follow pareto-based approach to obtain diverse trade-off solutions by optimizing conceptually contradicting validity measures silhouette index (Sil) and feature cardinality (d). For the third issue, we introduce genetic crossover operator to improve diversity in a recent Newtonian law of gravity-based metaheuristic binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in multi-objective optimization scenario; it is named as improved multi-objective BGSA for feature selection (IMBGSAFS). We use ten real-world data sets for comparison of the IMBGSAFS results with three multi-objective methods MBGSA, MOPSO, and NSGA-II in wrapper framework and the Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (FM-CC) as a multi-objective filter method. We employ four multi-objective quality measures convergence, diversity, coverage and ONVG. The obtained results show superiority of the IMBGSAFS over its competitors. An external clustering validity index F-measure also establish the above finding. As the decision maker picks only a single solution from the set of trade-off solutions, we employee the F-measure to select a final single solution from the external archive. The quality of final solution achieved by IMBGSAFS is superior over competitors in terms of clustering accuracy and/or smaller subset size. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",Data clustering; Feature selection; Gravitational search algorithm; Multi-objective optimization,Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Set theory; Clustering validity index; Data clustering; Exploration and exploitation; Feature subset selection; Gravitational search algorithms; Linear correlation coefficient; Unsupervised classification; Unsupervised feature selection; Feature extraction,"Prakash, J.; Computational Intelligence and Data Mining Research Laboratory, ABV - Indian Institute of Information technology and Management GwaliorIndia; email: jayprakash.iiitm@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035104565

It selects a subset of most informative words (terms) from the set of all words. Term distribution affects the feature selection process, e.g. an even distribution of terms in a specific class ensures a higher association of these terms with that class, but an even distribution in almost classes shows a lesser association. This paper computes sample variance using standard Mutual Information (MI) method to measure the variations in distribution of terms. MI method assigns a higher rank to the terms distributed in a specific category (i.e. rare terms) which shows it strong influence with the rare terms than common terms (i.e. terms which most frequently in almost classes). To address this issue, a new text feature selection method named Mutual Information Using Sample Variance (MIUSV) is proposed in this paper. It considers sample variance in term distribution while computing the Mutual Information score of the term. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifiers model, check the utilities of the selected terms by the proposed MIUSV. These models classify four standard text data sets, viz. Webkb, 20Newsgroup, Ohsumed10, and Ohsumed23. Two standard performance measures named Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 show a significant improvement in the results using proposed MIUSV method. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Feature selection; Information Retrieval; Term Frequency; Text Analysis; Text Classification; Text Mining,Classification (of information); Data mining; Information retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN); Multinomial naive bayes; Predictive capabilities; Term Frequency; Text analysis; Text classification; Text feature selections; Text mining; Feature extraction,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Classification performance depends on the nature of the sample input datasets during the training of classifier. When data samples of one class are more than the data samples of other class, then it is called as imbalanced datasets. In such case, algorithms always favor classifying samples into the overrepresented (majority) class. Existing classification model are inefficient in recognizing samples of the underrepresented (minority) class, which is frequently the class of interest (the minority class). In this paper, Support vector machine with clustering is proposed for learning from imbalanced data in which multiple sub-datasets are built from majority class samples by cluster partitioning method such that each of these sub-dataset has an approximately equal number of samples as a minority class datasets. Then a number of SVM classifiers is developed so that each classifier is trained with a different majority subdatasets and the same minority datasets. Advantage of proposed approach is that there is no loss of valuable information and no overfitting problem because proposed approach is not removing or adding any samples to datasets. Proposed approach is evaluated on many datasets and its performance is compared with existing SVM. Based on an overall result, we can conclude that the proposed SVM with clustering method is very efficient method for class imbalance problem. And result shows that the proposed approach has improved the minority class performance for imbalance problem compared to existing SVM techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Clustering; Imbalanced Datasets; Sampling; Support Vector Machine,Cluster analysis; Sampling; Support vector machines; Class imbalance problems; Classification models; Classification performance; Cluster partitioning; Clustering; Clustering methods; Imbalanced Data-sets; Over fitting problem; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

These processes improve the decision making during decease identification. Image classification is usually done by checking image visual or semantic content similarity. Image content may be represented by its low level visual features referring to mathematical attributes or high level description based semantic attributes. Image similarity is verified by using similarity or dissimilarity measures or distance metrics. As image attributes are wide in range, the similarity measure that worked well for one particular feature set may not show the similar performance for the other. Based on it this paper explored geometrical, statistical and cumulative dissimilarity measures viz. Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Cosine, Chi-square, Kullback, Jeffrey, Kolmogorov, Earthmover's and Cramer distances and compared their effect in similar looking image retrieval process. Experiments were done on these distance metrics with respect to appearance based features, intensity features, texture features and shape features. Through the experimentation, certain conclusions were drawn on the performance of these distance metrics with different feature sets in classification and retrieval.

This system is named LTE-CommSense by the authors and can be used in many environment sensing objectives namely monitoring of crop growth over a period of time, disaster monitoring, sea state monitoring, snow avalanche monitoring, security of large unmanned landscapes etc. This technology focuses on already known information from received signal e.g. reference symbols in the LTE communication signal frames. In the equalizer block of the receiver, the equalizer tap coefficients gets modified while training the equalizer using reference symbols. These modifications depend on the channel through which the received signal has passed through. Therefore the adaptive equalizer tap coefficients contain information related to the channel condition. We propose to use these coefficients to get an estimate of change in the channel properties. LTE spectrum and infrastructure will be utilized to get channel characteristics without affecting the existing communication system. After the channel information is received, phenomenological knowledge about the environment will be obtained using ASIN (Application Specific INstrumentation) phylosophy.

The purpose of this research is to detect DR in early stage. Early detection decrease blindness prevalence. Microaneurysm (MA) are the only earliest noticeable feature of DR. We propose a novel two-level method: coarse level use morphology for MA candidate detection and fine level use a binary decision tree (DT) classifier based on classification and regression tree(CART) for true MA classification.

The objective of this paper is to show the significance of incorporating chrominance information to the task of scene classification. An improved color-to-grayscale image conversion algorithm that effectively incorporates chrominance information is proposed using the color-to-gray structure similarity index and singular value decomposition to improve the perceptual quality of the converted grayscale images. The experimental results based on an image quality assessment for image decolorization and its success rate (using the Cadik and COLOR250 datasets) show that the proposed image decolorization technique performs better than eight existing benchmark algorithms for image decolorization. In the second part of the paper, the effectiveness of incorporating the chrominance component for scene classification tasks is demonstrated using a deep belief network-based image classification system developed using dense scale-invariant feature transforms. The amount of chrominance information incorporated into the proposed image decolorization technique is confirmed with the improvement to the overall scene classification accuracy. Moreover, the overall scene classification performance improved by combining the models obtained using the proposed method and conventional decolorization methods. © 2017 SPIE and IS&T.",color-to-gray structure similarity; color-to-grayscale; image decolorization; Oliva Torralba scene; scene classification; singular value decomposition,Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Color; Color image processing; Image enhancement; Singular value decomposition; Gray scale; image decolorization; Oliva Torralba scene; Scene classification; Structure similarity; Image classification,"Divakaran, G.; Centre for Computational Engineering and Networking, Amrita Vishwa VidyapeethamIndia; email: d_govind@cb.amrita.edu",,SPIE,10179909,,JEIME,,English,J.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a very powerful tool for investigating patient’s health and different physiological activities of the brain. A significant challenge in this BCI application is the accurate and reliable recognition of motor imagery (MI) task. A brain–computer interface based on MI interprets the patient’s brain activities into a control signal through classifying EEG patterns of various motor imagination tasks. The appropriate features are essential to achieving higher classification accuracy of EEG motor imagery task. For EEG signal feature extraction, wavelet transform is suitable for analysis of nonlinear time series signals. Nevertheless, the dimension of the extracted feature is huge and it may reduce the performance of classification method. Dimensionality reduction and classification play an important role in BCI motor imagery research. In this study, hybridization of particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based rough set feature selection technique is proposed for achieving a minimal set of relevant features from extracted features. The selected features are applied to the proposed novel neighborhood rough set classifier (NRSC) method for classification of multiclass motor imagery. The experimental results are delivered for nine subjects of the BCI Competition 2008 Dataset IIa to show the greater performance of the proposed algorithm. The outcome of proposed algorithms produces a higher mean kappa of 0.743 compared to 0.70 from sequential updating semi-supervised spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis.

This fact is more important in diseases like thyroid, which is very difficult to detect as its symptoms coincide with several diseases. Usage of machine learning algorithms for thyroid disease diagnosis is prominent. A typical thyroid disease diagnosis system uses three main steps, namely, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the use of filter-based (F-Score) and wrapper-based (Recursive Feature Elimination) feature selection algorithms on its effect on disease identification and classification. The analysis is also performed with Principle Component Analysis dimensionality reduction algorithms. Performance evaluation was performed with three metrics, namely, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Four classifiers, namely, MultiLayer Perceptron, Back Propagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Extreme Learning Machine were used to analyze the selected algorithms. Experimental results showed that while both F-Score and Recursive Feature Elimination improved the performance of thyroid disease diagnosis, the wrapper-based algorithm produced maximum efficiency and produced a maximum accuracy of 98.14% with ELM classifier. © 2017 IEEE.",Computer Aided Diagnosis; Dimensionality Reduction; Feature Selection; Filter-Based Algorithm; Principal Component Analysis; Thyroid Disease Diagnosis; Wrapper-Based Algorithm,Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Health care; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Back propagation neural networks; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction algorithms; Feature selection and classification; Filter-based; Principle component analysis; Recursive feature elimination; Thyroid disease diagnosis; Computer aided diagnosis,,Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,IEEE Int.

Several attempts to secure 802.11 standard ends up with the inadequate security mechanisms that are vulnerable to various attacks and intrusions. Thus, integration of external defense mechanism like intrusion detection system (IDS) is inevitable. An anomaly-based IDS employs machine learning algorithms to detect attacks. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensure the performance of the classifier in terms of speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability. This paper proposes a normalized gain based IDS for MAC Intrusions (NMI) to improve the IDS performance significantly. The proposed NMI includes two primary components OFSNP and DCMI. The first component is optimal feature selection using NG and PSO (OFSNP) and the second component is Detecting and Categorizing MAC 802.11 Intrusions (DCMI) using SVM classifier. The OFSNP ranks the features using an independent measure as normalized gain (NG) and selects the optimal set of features using semi-supervised clustering (SSC). The SSC is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that uses labeled and unlabeled features simultaneously to find a group of optimal features. Using the optimal set of features, the proposed DCMI utilizes a rapid and straightforward support vector machine (SVM) learning that classifies the attacks under the appropriate classes. Thus, the proposed NMI achieves a better trade-off between detection accuracy and learning time. The experimental results show that the NMI accurately detects and classifies the 802.11 specific intrusions and also, it reduces the false positives and computation complexity by decreasing the number of features. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Intrusion detection system; MAC 802.11; Normalized gain (NG); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machine (SVM) classifier; WLAN,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Computation complexity; Intrusion Detection Systems; MAC 802.11; Normalized gains; Optimal feature selections; Semi-supervised Clustering; WLAN; Feature extraction,"Kavitha, P.; Department of Information Technology, Adhiyamaan College of EngineeringIndia; email: kavitha.it@adhiyamaan.in",,Springer New York LLC,10220038,,WINEF,,English,Wireless Networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969850606

HMNNA consists of three neural networks trained specifically on different areas of problem space under consideration, and the trained networks are then arranged in a tree structure forming hierarchical modular neural network architecture. The three specialized neural networks are trained by Levenberg–Maarquardt neural network algorithm. As compared to the standard back propagation algorithm, Levenberg–Maarquardt is fast and stable for convergence with only one drawback, i.e., storage requirement for estimated Hessian Matrix. For training and testing of HMNNA, a huge primary database is created which contains 8091 cervical cell images pertaining to 200 clinical cases collected from two health care institutions of northern India. The raw cases of cervical cancer in the form of Pap smear slides were photographed under a multi-headed digital microscope. Individual cells were manually cropped off from these slide images which were then passed through a feature extraction module for morphological profiling. Each cell was calibrated on the basis of 40 features from both cytoplasm and nucleus. After profiling, these cells were vigilantly assigned cell classes as per the latest 2001-Bethesda system of cervical cancer cell classification, by trained cytotechnicians and histopathologists. HMNNA is also trained and tested on the Herlev Benchmark dataset created by the Denmark University, which consists of 1417 cervical cancer cells. Both the datasets have seven classes of diagnosis, i.e., superficial squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ, corresponding to the level of abnormality in cervical cells. These datasets are available in public domain at http://digitalpapsmeardb.in/and http://mde-lab.aegean.gr/index.php/downloads.The screening potential of the HMNNA is compared with 25 well-known machine learning algorithms available in MatlabR2016 (Machine learning and statistics toolbox 10.2) and monolithic neural network algorithms available in Matlab neural network pattern recognition toolbox. The HMNNA outperformed in all the 25 algorithms for both the datasets. For the Novel Benchmark database, it produced a classification accuracy of 95.32% with an F-value of 0.949310 and classification accuracy of 88.41% with an F-value of 0.89145 for the Herlev dataset. The screening potential of HMNNA was also evaluated and compared with the other diagnostic systems available in the recently published literature and was found to be performing much better than the counterparts on multiple parameters of performance evaluation. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Cervical cancer; Machine learning; Modular neural networks; Neural networks; Pap smear test,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Cells; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Cytology; Database systems; Digital devices; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Trees (mathematics); Cervical cancer cells; Cervical cancers; Classification accuracy; Modular neural networks; Neural network algorithm; Pap smear; Standard back propagation algorithms; Storage requirements; Network architecture,"Ali, M.; Department of Computer Science and IT, University of JammuIndia; email: mehbobaali@gmail.com",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

Large amount of EEG records have been taken from PhysioNet database and analyzed with the help of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The various statistical measures like maximum value, minimum value, mean value and standard deviation value of DWT sub-bands are used as extracted features for detection of different sleep disorders. For reducing the dimension of extracted features different feature reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are used.

The classification using the different machine learning technique leads for over fitting and under fitting. To select the optimized feature is a difficult task. The high dimension feature vector requires a high computational cost. The hand craft feature selection machine learning techniques performed poor. We have used the incremental feature selection strategy for feature selection. In this paper we first selected the feature and identify the principle feature then we classify gait data using different machine learning technique (KNN, ANN, SVM, DNN and classifier fusion) and shown the performance comparison. Experimental result on real time datasets propose method is better than previous method as far as humanoid locomotion classification is concerned and the generalization accuracy provided by new feature selection method i.e. incremental feature selection (IFS) with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Zhang et al., 20). During the feature extraction, 17 features were selected from the existing literatures (Wang et al. in IEEE Trans Circ Syst Video Technol 14(2):149–158, 15). Using all the features could lead to over fitting, information redundancy and dimension disaster. Thus, a system with optimal features was selected using ANOVA combined with IFA. These selected features were then fed as an input to the ANN, SVM, KNN and DNN model. These individual classifiers were combined to produce classifier fusion model. The 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Based on the empirical results it may be concluded that classifier fusion provides satisfactory results (92.23 %) compared to other individual classifiers.

Conventional medical image classification algorithms usually neglect the semantic gap problem between low-level features and high-level image semantic, which will largely degrade the classification performance. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-scale non-negative sparse coding based medical image classification algorithm. Firstly, Medical images are decomposed into multiple scale layers, thus diverse visual details can be extracted from different scale layers. Secondly, for each scale layer, the non-negative sparse coding model with fisher discriminative analysis is constructed to obtain the discriminative sparse representation of medical images. Then, the obtained multi-scale non-negative sparse coding features are combined to form a multi-scale feature histogram as the final representation for a medical image. Finally, SVM classifier is combined to conduct medical image classification.

First, monocular video taken using a stationary camera is given as the input to Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based foreground detector. Then a grid is used to measure the number of foreground pixels. If the pixels inside the grid is greater than a pre-assigned threshold, the grid will sense the presence of a vehicle. When the presence of a vehicle is identified within a frame, the region within the bounding box (created by foreground detector), which contain the RGB image of the vehicle is cropped and saved. SURF features of the stored frames are extracted and used for training classifier for 5 vehicle classes, namely, two wheelers, three wheelers, cars, Heavy Motor Vehicle (HMV) and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV). For classifying a test video, frames with vehicles are extracted using the grid and SURF features are extracted and applied to the classifier. When the feature of test vehicle image becomes closer to that of class, the vehicle will be categorized into that class. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified for different videos of heterogeneous traffic. © 2017 IEEE.",BoF (Bag of Features); GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model); SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features),Classification (of information); Food products; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Light weight vehicles; Pixels; Signal processing; Vehicles; Bag of features; Gaussian Mixture Model; Gmm (gaussian mixture model); Heterogeneous traffic; Light commercial vehicles; Speeded up robust features; Stationary cameras; Vehicle classification; Commercial vehicles,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Local tetra pattern (LTrP) is used to obtain the feature map from an input image. Decomposition of DWT up to single level and the features obtained from it would make the CBIR system very sensitive to noise. Therefore, decomposition up to three scales is used to remove noise. On each of the sub band LTrP is applied and 130 features are extracted. Further, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed for index matching and image retrieval task which gives the classification accuracy of 97.9 % for Corel 1K database. We have compared our proposed feature extraction scheme with LTrP and other existing local descriptor. Results show that combination of DWT and Local Tetra Patterns (DWT + LTrP) extracts more robust features than LTrP alone. Also, the effect of different wavelet filters on the accuracy of the system has been analyzed. Proposed framework has been tested on Corel-1000 and Corel-10000 databases. We have used average retrieval rate, precision, and recall for performance measure of the CBIR system. Proposed method outperforms the retrieval rate from 75.9% using LTrP to 97.9% using proposed method on Corel 1K database. Improvement in performance measures as compared to the other existing methods evidence that, the proposed spatio-frequency local descriptor is more robust for image retrieval task. © 2017 IEEE.",ANN; Corel database; DWT; Image retrieval; LBP; Local Tetra patterns,Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Database systems; Discrete wavelet transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Food products; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Content-Based Image Retrieval; Different wavelets; Index matching; Local descriptors; Local Tetra patterns; Performance measure; Spatio frequency; Image retrieval,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

However, such technological initiatives are still lacking in India, although it is the leading producer of many vegetables and fruits, for example, coconuts. Some of the activities carried out in a coconut farm that requires human labor are coconut dehusking, loading and unloading of coconuts. Automating these activities in a coconut farm would require a robotic system to pick and transport coconuts, for which the primary need would be to detect coconuts in those environments under natural lighting conditions. Towards this, the work in this paper tests for the applicability of three most used computer vision based object detection approaches namely, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) cascade, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) cascade and Haar-like cascade in coconut detection. This vision system would enable any field robot to automate the tasks in coconut farms without human assistance. A comparative analysis using confusion matrix is carried on these three approaches.

But, traditional methods based one-class classifiers are very time consuming due to its iterative process and various parameters tuning. In this paper, we present six OCC methods and their thirteen variants based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and online sequential ELM (OSELM). Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction based and boundary based, where three proposed classifiers belong to reconstruction based and three belong to boundary based. We are presenting both types of learning viz., online and offline learning for OCC. Out of six methods, four are offline and remaining two are online methods. Out of four offline methods, two methods perform random feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. We present a comprehensive discussion on these methods and their comparison to each other. Kernel feature mapping based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of one-class classifiers is tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a crucial factor in case of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been employed so far and analyze the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial datasets to check their boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from different discipline to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our proposed classifiers exhibit better performance compared to ten traditional one-class classifiers and ELM based two one-class classifiers. Through proposed one-class classifiers, we intend to expand the functionality of the most used toolbox for OCC i.e. DD toolbox. All of our methods are totally compatible with all the present features of the toolbox. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Autoassociative ELM (AAELM); Extreme learning machine (ELM); One-class classification (OCC); One-class ELM (OCELM); Online sequential ELM (OSELM),Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Mapping; Radial basis function networks; Autoassociative ELM (AAELM); Extreme learning machine; One-class Classification; One-class ELM (OCELM); Online sequential ELM (OSELM); E-learning; accuracy; Article; classification algorithm; classifier; data analysis; kernel method; linear system; machine learning; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; online system; prediction; priority journal; support vector machine,"Gautam, C.; Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Khandwa RoadIndia; email: chandangautam31@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,9252312,,NRCGE,,English,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013371957

TEO can track energy as a function of both amplitude and frequency of an audio signal. TEO is better for capturing energy variations in the signal that is produced by a real physical system, such as, environmental sounds that contain amplitude and frequency modulations. In proposed feature set, we have used Gammatone filterbank since it represents characteristics of human auditory processing. Here, we have used two classifiers, namely, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using cepstral features, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using spectral features. We performed experiments on two datasets, namely, ESC-50, and UrbanSound8K. We compared TEO-based coefficients with Mel filter cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Gammatone cepstral coefficients (GTCC), in which GTCC used mean square energy. Using GMM, the proposed TEO-based Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (TEO-GTCC), and its score-level fusion with MFCC gave absolute improvement of 0.45 %, and 3.85 % in classification accuracy over MFCC on ESC-50 dataset. Similarly, on UrbanSound8K dataset the proposed TEO-GTCC, and its scorelevel fusion with GTCC gave absolute improvement of 1.40 %, and 2.44 % in classification accuracy over MFCC. Using CNN, the score-level fusion of Gammatone spectral coefficient (GTSC) and the proposed TEO-based Gammatone spectral coefficients (TEO-GTSC) gave absolute improvement of 14.10 %, and 14.52 % in classification accuracy over Mel filterbank energies (FBE) on ESC-50 and UrbanSond8K datasets, respectively. This shows that proposed TEO-based Gammatone features contain complementary information which is helpful in ESC task. © EURASIP 2017.",,Filter banks; Gaussian distribution; Neural networks; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; Speech recognition; Amplitude and frequency modulations; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Environmental sound classifications; Gaussian Mixture Model; Real physical systems; Spectral coefficients; Teager energy operators; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78099E+12,,,English,"Euro.

The proposed method employs multiple dictionaries to effectively model variations present in the speech signal. Here, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is built using spectral features corresponding to frames of all the examples of a speech class. Multiple dictionaries corresponding to different mixture are learned using the respective speech frames. Given a train/test speech frame, minimum spectral distance measure from the GMM means is employed to select an appropriate dictionary. The selected dictionary is used to obtain the sparse feature representation, which is used for the classification of speech units. The effectiveness of the proposed feature is demonstrated using continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) based classifiers for (i) classification of isolated utterances of E-set of English alphabet, (ii) classification of consonant-vowel (CV) segments in Hindi language and (iii) classification of phoneme from TIMIT phonetic corpus.

An intelligent traffic surveillance system, equipped with electronic devices, works by communicating with moving vehicles about traffic conditions, monitor rules and regulations and avoid collision between cars. Therefore the first step in this process is the detection of cars. The system uses Haar like features for vehicle detection, which is generally used for face detection. Haar feature-based cascade classifiers are an effective object detection method first proposed by Viola and Jones. It's a machine learning based technique which uses a set of positive and negative images for training purpose.

The phase information is extracted from the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectrum. The phase of the pitch harmonic is used as a proposed feature for speech emotion classification. Pitch frequency varies with emotions, and due to this pitch harmonic also varies with different emotions. It is expected that the phase of the pitch harmonic contains emotion information. Significance of the harmonic phase is carried out by evaluating the mean and variance values for speech emotion classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed feature. The performance is evaluated using EMODB database. The performance of the proposed feature is compared with the the linear prediction coefficients (LPC), mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Teager energy operator (TEO) based non-linear critical band TEO autocorrelation envelope (TEO-CB-Auto-Env) features.

Feature selection is a preprocessing step used for selecting the significant information. The selection of optimal feature subset is an optimization problem which has been solved by several versions of metaheuristic algorithms. The metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the behavior of cuckoo birds is adapted to build the parallel cuckoo search optimization (PCSO) algorithm. The wrapper approach of parallel cuckoo search with Naive Bayes (PCSNB) is developed by combining the power of exploration of PCSO with the speed of Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier for finding feature subset that maximizes the accuracy.

The available resources in web are used by the users and also they involve in giving feedbacks and thus generate additional information. It is very essential to explore, analyze and organize their opinions and feedbacks in an efficient way for better decision making. So sentiment analysis (SA) is used to find the users opinion about a particular topic, product or problem in a more efficient way. The main aim of SA is to solve the problems in relation to opinions about products, movies, politics, review sites etc. Sentiment analysis can be done with different modalities by taking inputs from text, image, audio and video. This paper proposes a system that will automatically recognise the facial expression from the image and classify emotions for final decision. The system uses a simplified method called 'Viola Jones Face Detection' algorithm for face localization. Then facial features are extracted using three methods 'Zernike moments', 'LBP' and 'DCT transform'. The different feature vectors are combined together using a subset feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of recognition and classification process. Finally the combined features are trained and classified using SVM, Random Forest and KNN classifier.

Apart from the planting multiple tea varieties, growth of natural vegetation species is common scenario in plantations. The objective of this research was spectral discrimination of nine important tea varieties in the presence of six natural vegetation species in Munnar, Western Ghat highlands of south India. Discrimination models using six methods: k-nearest neighborhood classifier (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), normalized spectral similarity score (NS3), maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied on the hyperspectral reflectance measurements collected at canopy level. The existence and statistical significance of spectral differences of the tea and natural vegetation species were assessed by MANOVA. Results indicate that six out of 9 tea varieties could be discriminated with best accuracies 75 to 80%. While a closer spectral similarity is observed in few tea varieties, the presence of natural vegetation species has decreased inter species variability for few tea varieties while enhancing the same for few other tea varieties at the cost of reducing spectral separability among the vegetation species. © 2014 IEEE.",classification; hyperspectral species level discrimination; MANOVA; spectral matching; Tea plantations,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Image processing; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Vegetation; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral reflectance; Linear discriminant analysis; MANOVA; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Spectral matchings; Statistical significance; Tea plantations; Signal processing,"Nidamanuri, R.R.; Department of Earth and Space Sciences, Indian Institute of Space Science and TechnologyIndia; email: rao@iist.ac.in",,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78147E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

The acceptance of deep learning concept is due to unsupervised and scalable nature of it.

But as the visual recognition tasks such as scene classification and object detection become more challenging, the semantic gap between low-level feature and the concept descriptor of the scene images increases. In this paper, we present novel semantic multinomial (SMN) image representation that renders it possible to represent natural scenes by complex semantic description. SMN is a semantic representation of an image that corresponds to a vector of posterior probabilities of concepts. Proposed SMN representation uses dynamic kernel based support vector machines (SVMs) to model the semantic content of images. It is necessary to have ground truth (true) concept labels to obtain SMN representation. In this work, we also propose to use pseudo-concepts in the absence of true concept labels. The proposed SMN representation is also complementary to the low-level visual representation.

In the dataset, every feature is a contributor for prediction accuracy, the selection of significant features from the dataset is a challenging task. The feature selection technique based on metaheuristic algorithms is used for the selection of significant data. The metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the fish behavior under water is artificial fish swarm optimization (AFSO) is proposed in this paper. The wrapper approach of AFSO with support vector machine (SVM) is used for finding the feature subset with a minimum number of features. The proposed approach is tested on nine different datasets having binary and multiple imbalanced classes and correlated with other metaheuristic algorithms. The results show that the proposed approach is providing high classification accuracy with features subset having fewer features. © 2017 IEEE.",artificial fish swarm optimization; Classification; Feature selection; support vector machine,Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Optimization; Support vector machines; Artificial fish swarm optimizations; Classification accuracy; Efficient feature selections; Imbalanced class; Medical data sets; Meta heuristic algorithm; Prediction accuracy; Selection techniques; Feature extraction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To improve the accuracy of classification, many algorithms have been proposed earlier, but they suffer from poor classification accuracy and more false classification ratio. To overcome this issue, a multi attribute depthness similarity estimation technique to classify the data points towards the number of classes has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method takes the dataset and data points grouped by using labels. This method performs preprocessing by removing the noisy data points. It identifies distinct attributes of each class which has more importance among the data points. Based on identified attribute sets, this method computes multi attribute depthness similarity for each of the data points towards each class. The class which has more depthness value will be assigned as a class to the input data point. The classification accuracy is high compared to other algorithms by employing the Pertinent Dimension Detection and classification algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Classification Accuracy; Depthness similarity; High Dimensional Data Points; Labeled Data,Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Accuracy of classifications; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Depthness similarity; High dimensional data; Labeled data; Multi-attributes; Similarity estimation; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

Owing to its open architecture and large user base, it provides the developers with an open access to its code base and a large surface area to launch their malicious activities. This paper presents an approach to perform dynamic analysis of android applications to classify the applications as malicious or non malicious. To this end we have developed a syscall-capture system which collects and extracts the system call traces of all the applications during their run-time interactions with the phone platform. Subsequently all the collected system call data is aggregated and analysed to detect and classify the behaviour of Android applications. We have used our system to analyse the behaviour of 50 malicious applications obtained from the Android Malware Genome Project and 50 benign applications obtained from the Google Play Store. With the aim to classify the behaviour of these applications, we have considered the frequency of system calls made by each application as the prime feature set. To this effect we have achieved an acceptable levels of accuracy in correctly classifying the application as malicious or benign using the J48 Decision Tree algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",Android; Benign; Classification; Dynamic Analysis; Malicious; Malware Detection; System call,Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Dynamic analysis; Intrusion detection; Malware; Android; Benign; Malicious; Malware detection; System calls; Android (operating system),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This research is usable in monitoring, sorting and picking of fruits for ensuring faster production chain. This paper aims to analyze popular methods of auto-harvesting, categorization of fruits and proposes a new approach that overcomes some of the drawbacks of the previous methods. The proposed approach takes into account different types of fruits. The main goal is to come up with a method for classifying these different types of fruits accurately and efficiently. Images are preprocessed in order to separate the fruit in the foreground from the background. Texture features from Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and statistical color features are extracted from the segmented image. Two types of features are combined in a single feature descriptor. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model is trained using these feature descriptors extracted from the training dataset. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the category for an unlabeled image from the validation set. The proposed approach also works best for embedded systems and single board computers as it realizes the trade-offs of these devices. © 2017 IEEE.",color; GLCM; recognition; segmentation; SVM,Classification (of information); Color; Computer vision; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Fruits; Image segmentation; Integrated circuits; Intelligent robots; Support vector machines; Classification models; Color and texture features; Feature descriptors; GLCM; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Machine intelligence; recognition; Single board computers; Image texture,"Jana, S.; School of Education Technology, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: jana.susovan2@gmail.com",Nandi S.Sarkar A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

One of the most important and challenging issue in the data stream domain is the classification of the big datasets. However the conventional classification methods developed to run in a streaming environment with high use of memory constraints and longer execution running time. Another three major important issues in the data stream classification methods are huge length, conception drift and Feature Selection (FS). In this review paper, we consider the difficult problem of FS algorithms for streaming data, in which the size of streaming data for the feature set is unknown, primary to an inflexible demand in computation constraints, and not every feature is available from classifier model. In order to solve this difficulty, Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms are performed on the high dimensionality and streaming big dataset samples which result in increase classification accuracy, less memory consumption and lesser running time when compared to the existing streaming FS algorithms on various datasets. The proposed SI based FS algorithms overcomes the difficulty of the traditional FS algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Big data; Data Stream Mining; Data streams classification; Feature Selection (FS); metaheuristics; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Swarm Intelligence (SI),Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Signal processing; Swarm intelligence; Classification accuracy; Conventional classification methods; Data stream; Data stream classifications; Data stream mining; Feature selection algorithm; Hardware and software; Meta heuristics; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This mainly corresponds to the bulk of information which was easily embedded on each hyperspectral image. A large number of kernel based techniques were formulated and used in this regard. Since the dimension of the hyperspectral image (HSI) is very large, conventional image processing and classification methods does not have an emphasizing effect on feature extraction. This paper compares the performance of various classification algorithms such as kernel based methods implemented using LibSVM and GURLS and sparsity based algorithm known as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The assessment is done based on HSI classification accuracy. The experiment is conducted on standard dataset namely Indian Pines procured by the AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer). These algorithms can handle the entire dimensionality by taking the total number of classes into account, to retain information potential and effectively differentiate classes with sharp spectral differences. Based on the analysis of experiments undertaken, the study pinpoints to LIBSVM as a better classifier to OMP and GURLS being the best of the three. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; GURLS; Hyperspectral Image; Kernal methods; LIBSVM; OMP,Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Data mining; Extraction; Hyperspectral imaging; Image processing; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometers; Classification algorithm; Extraction of information; GURLS; Hyper-spectral imageries; Kernal methods; LIBSVM; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Image classification,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Based on the sparse classification depthness measure the method identifies the region which has affected or abnormal. At the classification stage, the method computes the sparse learning based pixel similarity measure to identify the most affected region and to perform classification. The entire hardware model can be split into two important levels namely Algebric histogram based Feature extraction and sparse learning based feature classification using SDNN technique. The identification of the kidney Abnormality in the image is displayed with colour for easy identification and visibility in monitor using HDL algorithms.

The extracted aspects are fine-grained for the presentation form known as Review Highlights. The syntactic approach for extraction process suffers from the overlapping chunking rules which result in noise extraction. We introduce a hybrid technique which combines machine learning and rule based model. A multi-label classifier identifies the effective rules which efficiently parse aspects and opinions from texts. This selection of rules reduce the amount of noise in extraction tasks. This is a novel attempt to learn syntactic rule fitness from a corpus using machine learning for accurate aspect extraction. As the model learns the syntactic rule prediction from the corpus, it makes the extraction method domain independent. It also allows studying the quality of syntactic rules in a different corpus. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Speech emotion recognition is a field having diverse applications. The prime objective of this paper is to recognize emotions in speech and classify them in 7 emotion output classes namely, anger, boredom, disgust, anxiety, happiness, sadness and neutral. The proposed approach is based upon the Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and energy of the speech signals as feature inputs and uses Berlin database of emotional speech. The features extracted from speech are converted into a feature vector, which in turn are used to train different classification algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Decision Forest and Gradient Boosting.

This paper highlights the application of classifying and predicting a specific disease by implementing the operations on medical data generated in the field of medical and healthcare. In this project an efficient multiclass Naïve Bayes algorithm is used for prediction of a particular disease by training it on a set of data before implementation. Wrong clinical decisions taken by medical practitioners can cause any harm or result in serious loss of life of a patient which is hard to afford by any hospital. To acquire a precise and cost effective treatment, technology based Data Mining Systems can be constructed to make worthy decisions. The main aim of this project is to build a basic decision support system which can determine and extract previously unseen patterns, relations and concepts related with multiple disease from a historical database records of specified multiple diseases. The proposed system can solve difficult queries for detecting a particular disease and also can assist medical practitioners to make smart clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems were not able to. The decisions taken by medical practitioners with the help of technology can result in effective and low cost treatments. There is an insufficiency of technology and analysis system and methods to discover connections, concepts and patterns in the medical data. Data mining is an engineering study of extracting previously undiscovered patterns from a selected set of data. In this paper, data mining methods namely, Naive Bayes and J48 algorithms are compared for testing their accuracy and performance on the training medical datasets. The medical datasets will be visualized by different visualization techniques like 2D/3D graphs, pie charts and other methods. The algorithms mentioned above are compared and evaluated on basis of their accuracy and time consumption factors.

Here measurement error and heterogeneity in the health data set has been handled using fuzzy variables and represented as symptoms. A parameter severity-factor has been designed to measure health condition of the patient based on the combination of the symptoms, demonstrating deviation from the normal values. Another parameter disease-factor is proposed to assess chance of disease of the person based on symptoms other than blood pressure and pulse rate.

Data classification is another type of problem for classifying a feature set into several feature subsets, and those are further clustered into different classes on the basis of binary or multiclassification. Many problems in science and technology, industry and commercial business and medicine and health care can be treated as classification problems. In recent years, many methods are existing to build a classification model based on many statistical concepts and optimization methods. One major issue of building statistical model will have the principle to provide good accuracy simply when the principal assumptions are correct. The classification decision made on accuracy only justifies the performance of the particular model. Before applying the model to the particular application, it requires good perceptive of data utilized. In order to provide an effective learning algorithm to refine such complexity in handling the data and to minimize output errors and to provide the hands to improve the efficiency of the model, this research article is framed. In this work, a novel algorithm named ‘swarm-based cluster algorithm’ is proposed to complete the feature selection task in order to produce optimized feature-based clusters for effective data and weblogs classification. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Blog classification; Data classification; k-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm-based cluster algorithm (SBCA),Blogs; Classification (of information); Data handling; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Blog classifications; Classification decision; Classification models; Cluster algorithms; Data classification; K-means clustering; Multi-classification; Science and Technology; Clustering algorithms,"Neeba, E.A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Computing, Veltech Dr. RR and Dr. SR UniversityIndia; email: neebaphd@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9208542,,JOSUE,,English,J Supercomput,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031503457

Proposed approach identifies control points (Voronoi diagram) by exploring the structures of class specific manifolds which constructs complex boundaries with piecewise linear nature. Such a framework has less number of hyperparameters to tweak resulting easy control and understanding of the system. The learning characteristics of the proposed algorithm has been depicted on toy and optical coherence tomography data set.

The choice of features, which compose a big difficulty in classification techniques, is solved by using Genetic Algorithm.

Time and frequency domain statistical features derived from breath-to-breath (BB) interval series of respiratory signal is input to a support vector machine (SVM) backend classifier. We used data from normative population, individuals with anxiety disorders and regular meditators for validating the effectiveness of the system. We experimented with different kernels for the backend SVM classifier in our baseline system, and note that the best results were obtained for the polynomial kernel, a classification accuracy of 69.23%. It may be noted that for classification using SVM, either the features should match the kernel, or the kernel that matches the features should be selected for optimum performance. Often, this process is very difficult, owing to the difficulty in identifying a matching kernel. Alternatively, we may transform the feature vectors to a higher dimensional linear space, and then use SVM with a linear kernel. We used Fisher vector encoding (FVE) for mapping the features to a higher dimensional linear space. Also, we examined principal component analysis (PCA) and covariance normalization on the input features and the transformed feature vectors, in an effort to reduce the effect of patient specific variations in the signal to improve the performance. A performance improvement of 7.69% absolute using PCA-AnD, 15.38% absolute using FVE-AnD, and 15.38% absolute using CVN-AnD, over the baseline system were obtained. Further, we combined FVE and CVN, and obtained FVE-CVN system with a classification accuracy of 92.30% absolute, which is 23.08% absolute improved over the baseline system. © 2017 IEEE.",anxiety detection; biomedical; health care; psychiatric disorders; statistical features; SVM,Frequency domain analysis; Health care; Mathematical transformations; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Signal analysis; Smart city; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Vectors; biomedical; Classification accuracy; Higher-dimensional; Optimum performance; Psychiatric disorders; Respiratory signals; Statistical features; Time and frequency domains; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

Most of the reported techniques suffer from the disadvantages of large feature dimension, computational complexity of the features and complex classifiers which make implementation difficult and time consuming. In this paper we explore the utility of Fourier harmonic phase of the ECG data for MI identification. The phase response properties of the Fourier harmonics of the time and amplitude normalized lead II ECG beats from healthy and infarction records were analyzed to identify two clearly distinguishable features related to the changes in the phase distribution pattern. Use of heuristic threshold based classification with these extracted features could classify the healthy and the inferior infarction data from the PTB diagnostic ECG database with a high detection accuracy of 97.4% and sensitivity and specificity of 98.2% and 96.3% respectively. The robustness of the proposed technique was also validated with real ECG data collected using BIOPAC MP-45 data acquisition system. The results are clearly indicative of the potential of this novel feature space for MI identification.

Since vehicle tracking involves localizationand association of vehicles between frames, detection and classification of vehicles is necessary. Vision-based approaches are popular for this task due to cost-effectiveness and usefulness of appearance information associated with the vision data. In this paper, a deep learning system using region-based convolutional neural network trained with PASCAL VOC image dataset is developed for the detection and classification of on-road obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians and animals. The implementation of the system on a Titan X GPU achieves a processing frame rate of at least 10 fps for a VGA resolution image frame. This sufficiently high frame rate using a powerful GPU demonstrate the suitability of the system for highway driving of autonomous cars. The detection and classification results on images from KITTI and iRoads, and also Indian roads show the performance of the system invariant to object's shape and view, and different lighting and climatic conditions. © 2017 IEEE.",Autonomous driving; convolutional neural network; deep learning; object classification; object detection; R-CNN,Automobile frames; Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Graphics processing unit; Neural networks; Object detection; Obstacle detectors; Roads and streets; Smart city; Transportation; Vehicles; Autonomous driving; Classification results; Climatic conditions; Convolutional neural network; Object classification; Perception systems; R-CNN; Vision-based approaches; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

Smart healthcare, communication, infrastructure are required for the development of smart cities. Security is one of the major concern in the development of smart cities. Automatic surveillance helps in boosting security in multiple areas like traffic, hospitals, schools, and industries etc. Video camera and Global Positioning System (GPS) based monitoring are one of the key parts of it. Filtering or classification of infrequent or anomalous activities in traffic data help to understand the flow of movements in monitoring area. Video based surveillance involves the extraction of object trajectories from videos and then analyzing them to spot unusual behavior of objects to secure area under surveillance. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for the classification of object trajectories using the combination of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering technique and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The features extracted from FCM are then classified using SVM classifier. The approach has been tested on two publicly available datasets, namely, CROSS [12] and T11 [18]. Accuracies of 90.37% and 87.29% have been recorded on CROSS and T11 datasets, respectively.

However, due to increasing needs for scalability and performance, alternative systems have emerged, namely NewSQL technology. NewSQL is a class of modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) that provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) read-write workloads while still maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system. The rising interest in NewSQL technology, over the last few years resulted in an increasing number of evaluations and comparisons among competing NewSQL technologies. Some of the NewSQL databases currently used in various popular web applications are VoltDB, Google Spanner, MemSQL, SAP HANA, NuoDB, and TokuDB. This work is trying to comment on the various NewSQL database systems which describes benefits, characteristics, and classification of NewSQL databases for online transaction processing (OLTP) for Big data management. It also provides the list of popular NewSQL databases in categorized tables. This dissertation work mainly covers evaluation comparison between four NewSQL databases: NuoDB, VoltDB, MemSQL, and Cockroach DB on the basis of various parameters like read latency, write latency, update latency, and execution time.

Face, Fingerprint and Iris are the biometric modalities commonly used in the authentication systems. Simplicity of use, reliability and uniqueness are important characteristics of biometric based authentications. This kind of techniques can solve the typical problem of systems based on use of password which can be forgotten or stolen. Biometric systems plays a significant role in personal, national, and global security. Despite the increase in usage of biometric based systems, these are quiet susceptible to sophisticated spoofing attacks. Various spoofing attacks are present to defeat such biometric authentication systems. To improve the level of security, it is necessary to augment the reliable liveness detection tools as software modules along with the existing authentication systems. This paper targets the countermeasures for the biometric spoofing attacks and also suggests technical measures for implementing the biometric liveness detection systems. The research in this field is very active, with local descriptors. In order to overcome the shortcomings of already existing liveness detection tools, in this work we propose two different feature extraction techniques for software-based liveness detection: Convolutional Networks and Local Binary Patterns. Both techniques were used in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

The human faces may be obstructed by other object that makes the acquisition of fully holistic image processing as a complex task. To overcome this problem, a new partial face recognition system is introduced in this paper. This work includes the preprocessing, face detection, feature extraction and classification tasks. At first, the given face image is preprocessed by using the Gaussian filtering technique, which efficiently removes the noise and smoothens the image. Then, the Viola Jones algorithm is implemented to detect the face from the filtered image. Here, the Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) technique is employed to extract the features for better classification. After that, the Robust Point Set Matching (RPSM) technique is used to align the probe partial face to gallery facial images even with the presence of occlusion, random partial crop and exaggerated facial expression. Finally, the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classification technique is developed to classify the given face image. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed face recognition system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision and recall. © 2017 IEEE.",Face recognition; Gaussian Filtering; Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN); Robust Point Set Matching (RPSM); Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT); Viola Jones Face Detection,Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Geometry; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image processing; Neural networks; Pulse shaping circuits; Gaussian filtering; Point set; Probabilistic neural networks; Scale invariant feature transformations; Viola jones; Face recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The odour detection systems can be broadly classified into four categories such as gas sensors, bio-sensors, gas chromatography systems and hybrid systems. Other common odour detection instruments like electronic noses (E-noses), mass spectrometers (MS), differential optical absorption spectrometers (DOAS) are also reviewed in this paper. The selection of any odour detection technique is influenced by several factors like on-field deployability, odour detection and classification capabilities, sensitivity of the instruments and sensitivity of the instruments to the air matrices. Among all the possible detection methods, Electronic nose is having advanced capabilities as compared to other instruments. The presence of interference noise act as a major hindrance for the efficiency of the odour detection devices.

A number of theoretical and practical solutions to query processing have been proposed under various scenarios. With the recent popularity of cloud computing, data owners now have the opportunity to outsource not only their data but also data processing functionalities to the cloud. Because of data security and personal privacy concerns, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) should be encrypted before being outsourced to a cloud, and the cloud should perform query processing tasks on the encrypted data only. These tasks are termed as Privacy Preserving Query Processing (PPQP) over encrypted data. These protocols protect the confidentiality of the stored data, user queries, and data access patterns from cloud service providers and other unauthorized users.

Gait recognition is a behavioural biometric method that includes human identification from afar i.e. in absence of human and this is achieved by analysing the behaviour of their walking. Main aim to make GAIT recognition system is to impart a best method to recognize risks in places where high security is required like in banking, parking, airports etc. or to detect disease like Parkinson’s. In this paper we have shown the importance of gait recognition in order to detect whether a human GAIT is normal or abnormal, firstly the features of human gait is collected and then they are classified using neural network (Back propagation) and KNN classification technique. To test the proposed system the database contains 204 gaits and 16 different features were recognised, in which 3 datasets are crouch gait dataset and one normal gait dataset of 4 different humans is collected. We have obtained 100% of classification accuracy for a training data.

The process of classifying objects into predefined and semantically meaningful categories using its features is called object classification. Many researchers are working in this area to improve the accuracy of classification and to reduce the dimension of features extracted which are used for classifying the objects. In this paper, we propose Linear Predictive Coding(LPC) based signal approximation on the Tensor features which reduces the dimension of the feature by removing the redundancies in the feature set, so that the accuracy is increased with less computation time. Deep Neural Network (DNN) which is a type of artificial intelligence that could solve complex perceptual problems as fast as human brain is used in this work to classify the objects in videos and images. In the proposed method we employ the combination of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Tensor features of reduced dimensions.

In this manuscript a FSM based architecture is developed for the efficient implementation of K-means algorithm.

Differences in the results of such categorization arise from the feature set chosen to base the association of a given document with a given category. This process is challenging mainly because there can be large number of discriminating words which render many of the current algorithms unable to complete this. For most of these tasks there exist both relevant as well as irrelevant features. The objective here is to bring about a text classification on the basis of the features selected and also pre-processing to bring down the dimensionality and increase the accuracy of classification of the feature vector. Here the most commonly used methods are meta-heuristic algorithms in order to facilitate selection. Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) takes the underlying intelligence of the behaviour of fish swarming to combat the problems of optimization as well as the combinatorial problems. This method has been greatly successful in diverse applications but does suffer from certain limitations like not having multiplicity. Therefore, a modification has been proposed to AFSA which is MAFSA that has a crossover in its operation in order to bring about an improvement in the text classification selection. SVM or Support Vector Machine, Adaboost classifiers and naïve bayes are all used here. MAFSA has proved itself to be superior to AFSA in terms of precision and also the selected feature numbers. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA); Classifiers; Feature selection; Text classification,Adaptive boosting; Classifiers; Feature extraction; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Image retrieval; Optimization; Support vector machines; Text processing; Accuracy of classifications; Ada boost classifiers; Artificial fish swarm algorithms; Combinatorial problem; Diverse applications; Meta heuristic algorithm; Text categorization; Text classification; Classification (of information),"Thiyagarajan, D.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, K.S.

In this paper we apply and analyze the commonly used classification algorithms on medical data set that helps to predict heart disease that accounts to be the primary cause of death worldwide. It is complex for medical practitioners to envisage the heart attack as it requires experience and knowledge. The health sector today contains concealed yet significant information for making decisions. Experiments conducted reveal that algorithm such as J48, SIMPLE CART and REPTREE provides more predictive accuracy than other algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification techniques; Data mining; Diseases,Data mining; Diseases; Internet of things; Supervised learning; Amount of information; Classification algorithm; Classification technique; Data mining classification algorithms; Knowledge discovery from database; Medical practitioner; Predictive accuracy; Semi- supervised learning; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Brain MRI classification into normal and abnormal has received increasing attention because of the high level of difficulty in handling those huge numbers of images. Recently, many computational techniques are widely employed to segregate the normal images from pathological. Thus, this study has attempted to analyse the capability of various supervised data mining techniques in classifying the brain MR images. Initially, the images are pre-processed and the volumetric features are extracted. Then, these are fed into feature selection techniques viz. Principal Component Analysis, Runs, Fisher filtering and ReliefF feature selection to determine relevant features. The selected features are utilised for the supervised data mining techniques viz. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Tree and C4.5 to identify the abnormal images of brain. Among them, SVM has achieved highest accuracy of 71.33% with the features extracted through ReliefF feature selection with Leave-One-Out cross validation. Random Tree achieved accuracy of 82% with Runs filtered features. The classification will aid the segmentation of brain tumor from large set of MRI slices by eliminating the normal slices. This greatly reduces the computational time and memory required for the process of segmentation. © 2017 IEEE.",Brain Tumor; Classification; Data Mining; Machine Learning Challenge; Magnetic Resonance Images,Brain; Computation theory; Computational methods; Data mining; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image classification; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Principal component analysis; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Tumors; Accurate prediction; Brain tumors; Computational technique; Computational time and memory; Leave-one-out cross validations; Level of difficulties; Selection techniques; Volumetric features; Classification (of information),,Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Researchers are utilising scattering-based model, polarimetric-based model and empirical model for classification purpose on SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, but achieving good classification accuracy requires more consideration. Most of the work reported has been performed by either utilising only single polarisation channel or on the composite image, due to which the significance of each channel remains unidentified. Previously, SAR feature-based land cover characterisation has shown favourable results, by examining the use of one or two forms of features and not much attempt has been dedicated to the simultaneous incorporation of multiple types of texture and wavelet features in a manner that preserves all the significant segregation information for land cover classification. Therefore, in this paper, different statistical, textural and wavelet features were analysed on three individual polarimetric channels (HH, HV and VV). For enhancing the discrimination capability, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis have been employed and the classification information attained from the three polarimetric channels was fused for accounting the implication of each of them.

In this paper, a new technique for automated classification of sleep stages based on iterative filtering of EEG signals is presented. In order to perform sleep stages classification, the EEG signals are decomposed using iterative filtering method. The modes obtained from iterative filtering of EEG signal can be considered as amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) components. The discrete energy separation algorithm (DESA) is applied to the modes to determine amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions. The extracted amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions have been used to compute Poincaré plot descriptors and statistical measures. The Poincaré plot descriptors and statistical measures are applied as input features for different classifiers in order to classify sleep stages. The classifiers namely, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, C4.5 decision tree, and random forest are applied in order to classify the EEG epochs corresponding to various sleep stages. The experimental study has been performed on online available Sleep-EDF database for two-class to six-class classification of sleep stages based on EEG signals. The two-class to six-class classification problems are formulated by taking different combinations of EEG signals corresponding to various sleep stages. The comparison of the results is presented for different multi-class classification problems with the other recently proposed methods. The results show that the proposed method has provided better tenfold cross-validation classification accuracy than other existing methods. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Classifiers; Electroencephalogram signal; Iterative filtering; Sleep stages; Teager energy operator,Amplitude modulation; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Frequency modulation; Iterative methods; Nearest neighbor search; Signal processing; Sleep research; Automated classification; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram signals; Iterative filtering; Multiclass classification problems; Sleep stage; Sleep stages classifications; Teager energy operators; Biomedical signal processing,"Sharma, R.; Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology IndoreIndia; email: phd1301102007@iiti.ac.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

New technologies and skills should be developed and formulated to fight against malwares with the goals of automatic identification of malwares as well as their families. A lot of research is going on to combat the malwares, but still in vain. In order to design tools to fight against it, a systematic understanding is needed on its various types, behaviors along with different detection and analysis techniques. With all above, this paper summarizes a thorough information regarding malwares, their classification techniques, different obfuscation methods, packing and unpacking concepts along with particular tools.

Dynamic texture is the sequence of images of a moving scene that shows some form of temporal regularity. Though, the dynamic texture is the spatiotemporal extension of the conventional texture, its analysis requires additional attention, since the motion causes continuous changes in the geometry of these textures. Hence, to recognize the noisy dynamic texture, the noise should be estimated not only at the spatial level; it must also be estimated at the temporal level. To this end, an auto tuned noise resistance descriptor, based on the Local Binary Pattern approach, is proposed for the modeling and classification of the dynamic texture. Our approach based on the fact that, uniform local binary patterns are the fundamental units of image texture and occur more frequently in an image in comparison to non-uniform patterns. Noise affects these uniform local binary patterns and more likely fall into non-uniform codes. To counter this, we have extended conventional local binary pattern descriptor from a 2-value code to a 3-value code to include an additional state (called indecisive state) to represent the noise affected pixels. However, the estimation of the indecisive state is of the primary concern of this letter due to the inherently varying nature of the dynamic texture. The proposed technique devised a new scheme to estimate the noisy pixels in a dynamic texture. Eventually, the indecisive state is corrected back to non-noisy natural states using a mapping function so as to form a uniform LBP code. Experimental results on the UCLA and Dyntex++ databases demonstrate high classification efficiency of the proposed approach in the noisy environment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Dynamic texture; Local binary pattern; Noise resistance; Uniform pattern,Binary images; Bins; Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Content based retrieval; Pixels; Classification efficiency; Dynamic texture recognition; Dynamic textures; Local binary patterns; Noise resistance; Non-uniform patterns; Uniform local binary patterns; Uniform pattern; Image texture,"Tyagi, V.; Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology, Raghogarh, India; email: dr.vipin.tyagi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992179518

However, many of these features may be irrelevant and redundant, which only worsen the performance of the learning algorithms, and this may lead to the problem of overfitting. These superfluous features only degrade the accuracy and the computation time of a classification algorithm. So, the selection of relevant and nonredundant features is an important preprocessing step of any classification problem. Most of the global optimization techniques have the ability to converge to a solution quickly, but these begin with initializing a population randomly and the choice of initial population is an important step. In this paper, local searching algorithms have been used for generating a subset of relevant and nonredundant features; thereafter, a global optimization algorithm has been used so as to remove the limitations of global optimization algorithms, like lack of consistency in classification results and very high time complexity, to some extent. The computation time and classification accuracy are improved by using a feature set obtained from sequential backward selection and mutual information maximization algorithm which is fed to a global optimization technique (genetic algorithm, differential evolution or particle swarm optimization). In this proposed work, the computation time of these global optimization techniques has been reduced by using variance as stopping criteria.

The automated delineation of lesion is a prerequisite prior to characterization, which is challenging itself. Thus, this paper has two major objectives: (a) design of a segmentation system which can model by learning the lesion characteristics and this is posed as a Bayesian model; (b) develop a psoriasis risk assessment system (pRAS) by crisscrossing the blocks which drives the fundamental machine learning paradigm. Methods The segmentation system uses the knowledge derived by the experts along with the features reflected by the lesions to build a Bayesian framework that helps to classify each pixel of the image into lesion vs. background. Since this lesion has several stages and grades, hence the system undergoes the risk assessment to classify into five levels of severity: healthy, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. We build nine kinds of pRAS utilizing different combinations of the key blocks. These nine pRAS systems use three classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN)) and three feature selection techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and Mutual Information (MI)). The two major experiments conducted using these nine systems were: (i) selection of best system combination based on classification accuracy and (ii) understanding the reliability of the system. This leads us to computation of key system performance parameters such as: feature retaining power, aggregated feature effect and reliability index besides conventional attributes like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. Results Using the database used in this study consisted of 670 psoriasis images, the combination of SVM and FDR was revealed as the optimal pRAS system and yielded a classification accuracy of 99.84% using cross-validation protocol. Further, SVM-FDR system provides the reliability of 99.99% using cross-validation protocol. Conclusions The study demonstrates a fully novel model of segmentation embedded with risk assessment. Among all nine systems, SVM-FDR produced best results. Further, we validated our pRAS system with automatic segmented lesions against manually segmented lesions showing comparable performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian segmentation; Color features; Machine learning; Performance evaluation; Psoriasis; Texture features,"Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Dermatology; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Reliability; Support vector machines; Bayesian segmentation; Color features; Performance evaluation; Psoriasis; Texture features; Risk assessment; Article; Bayes theorem; benchmarking; classifier; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity assessment; Fsher Discriminant Ratio; image segmentation; machine learning; Mutual Information; nerve cell network; principal component analysis; psoriasis; risk assessment; support vector machine; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; discriminant analysis; human; pathology; psoriasis; reproducibility; risk assessment; Bayes Theorem; Decision Trees; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Principal Component Analysis; Psoriasis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Support Vector Machine","Suri, J.S.; Skin Point-of-Care Division, Global Biomedical Technologies, Inc.United States; email: jsuri@comcast.net",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28859832,English,Comput.

Generally, a classifier ensemble performs better than any single classifier in the ensemble. Naive Bayes classifiers are simple but popular classifiers for many applications. As it is difficult to create diverse naive Bayes classifiers, naive Bayes ensembles are not very successful. In this paper, we propose Random Subclasses (RS) ensembles for Naive Bayes classifiers. In the proposed method, new subclasses for each class are created by using 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) framework that uses randomly selected points from the training data. A classifier considers each subclass as a class of its own. As the method to create subclasses is random, diverse datasets are generated. Each classifier in an ensemble learns on one dataset from the pool of diverse datasets. Diverse training datasets ensure diverse classifiers in the ensemble. New subclasses create easy to learn decision boundaries that in turn create accurate naive Bayes classifiers. We developed two variants of RS, in the first variant RS(2), two subclasses per class were created whereas in the second variant RS(4), four subclasses per class were created. We studied the performance of these methods against other popular ensemble methods by using naive Bayes as the base classifier. RS(4) outperformed other popular ensemble methods. A detailed study was carried out to understand the behavior of RS ensembles. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",adaBoost.M1; bagging; Classifier ensembles; clusters; naive bayes; subclasses,Classifiers; adaBoost.M1; bagging; Classifier ensembles; clusters; Naive bayes; subclasses; Classification (of information),"Ahmad, A.; College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates UniversityUnited Arab Emirates; email: amirahmad@uaeu.ac.ae",,World Scientific Publishing Co.

An attempt towards accurate classification of dental diseases is addressed in this paper. Labeled dataset consisting of 251 Radio Visiography (RVG) x-ray images of 3 different classes is used for classification. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a most effective tool in machine learning which enables solving the problems like image recognition, segmentation, classification, etc., with high order of accuracy. It is found from literature that CNN performs well in natural image classification problems where large dataset is available. In this paper we experimented on the performance of CNN for diagnosis of small labeled dental dataset. In addition, transfer learning is used to improve the accuracy. Experimental results are presented for three different architectures of CNN.

Majority times, only few of the reported bugs are selected to be fixed. The selected bugs are prioritized (ordered) based on their severity (e.g. the bug inhibits an important feature of the product, the bug affects a large number of users) and then fixed according to their priority. If the severity is assigned incorrectly then time and resources may be wasted to fix that bug. Hence there is a need for new techniques to avoid this misuse of resources. In this paper, bagging ensemble method is used for predicting the severity of bug reports. Also, bagging ensemble method is compared with C4.5 classifier. The results have shown that bagging ensemble method gives better accuracy compared to C4.5 general classifier on the given dataset. © 2016 IEEE.",Bug Severity; Bug triage; Bugzilla,Computer circuits; Bug reports; Bug Severity; Bug triage; Bugzilla; Business needs; Classification algorithm; Ensemble methods; Important features; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The projected approach includes a technique to elicit emotion factors from users, a replacement illustration of emotions and a framework for predicting and pursuit user’s emotional mechanical phenomenon over time. The neural network based CML service has better training concert and enlarged exactness compare to other large scale deep learning systems. Opinions are important to almost all human activities and cloud based sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment related information from text. With the rising popularity and availability of opinion rich resources such as personal blogs and online appraisal sites, new opportunities and issues arise as people now, actively use information technologies to explore and capture others opinions. In the existing system, a segmentation ranking model is designed to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification. A classification model is used for predicting the sentiment polarity of segmentation. The joint framework is trained directly using the sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without the use of any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. However the existing system still has issue with classification accuracy results. To improve the classification performance, in the proposed system, cloud integrate the support vector machine, naive bayes and neural network algorithms along with joint segmentation approaches has been proposed to classify the very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative features more effectively using important feature selection. Also to handle the outliers we apply modified k-means clustering method on the given dataset. It is used to cloud cluster the outliers and hence the label as well as unlabeled features is handled efficiently.

The specific study emphasizes on the selection of best EEG features for classification and detection of epileptic seizure from temporal EEG. This study makes use of twelve different features to select suitable quantitative features. During the experimental study, it was observed that the variance, maximum, wavelet log energy entropy, rms and band power features were increasing parameters for epileptic EEG, on the other hand, the minimum, wavelet Shannon entropy and zero crossing features were increasing parameters for normal EEG and shows distinguishable differences between normal and epileptic EEG.

Every single day, we hear of emergency situations in flights like fires, birdstrikes, diversions, engine failures and emergency landings etc. Across the globe, Air Traffic Controllers are constantly monitoring the in-flight situation based on inputs from the pilots and advicing them on possible diversions or measures to take so as to avoid any danger to the lifes of passengers and the cabin crew. Though, the manual monitoring of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Conversations is efficient and reliable, but still, it may be subject to human biass and glitches. Also, post-flight monitoring is difficult because there is no such automatic measure for arriving at the conclusion, whether the flight faced an emergency or not. Audio Signal Processing finds an interesting use in this case. By extracting some crucial features from an audio conversation, one can proceed towards the classification once the feautres seem good and efficient. The paper mainly focusses on extracting these features critical to ATC analysis.

Choosing the most relevant qualities from huge microarray expression is very important. It is a most explored subject in bioinformatics because of its hugeness to move forward humans understanding of inherent causing cancer mechanism. In this paper, we aim to classify leukaemia cells. Our approach relies on selecting the predominant features from the dataset and classifying it using classification algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM). As the dataset is very large we need to reduce the size before classification, to decrease the computation time and increase the accuracy of the classifier. SVM-RFE removes only most irrelevant gene in each iteration. This algorithm does not differentiate the correlated genes. So before applying SVM-RFE for gene selection, a correlation-based feature selection is applied using FCBF (Fast Correlation-Based Filter) to select the most prominent not correlated genes. The resultant classifier generated using this set of genes yields more accurate result and reduce the computational time. © 2017 IEEE.",Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia(ALL); Acute Myeloid Leukaemia(AML); Fast Correlation-Based Filter(FCBF).; Gene expression; Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE),Diseases; Gene expression; Iterative methods; Support vector machines; Acute lymphoblastic leukaemias; Acute Myeloid Leukaemia(AML); Cancer classification; Classification algorithm; Correlation based feature selections; Fast Correlation-Based Filter(FCBF); Microarray expressions; Support vector machine recursive feature eliminations; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Detection of outlier is an active area of research in data mining. If clustering methods are used, the elements that are lying outside the clusters are focused and detected as outliers. But it is not true few unknown elements will become a part of the cluster. So to ignore the irrelevant data completely from the data set, it becomes necessary to identify and eliminate these data merged with the clusters. An efficient hybrid approach is proposed to reduce the number of outliers. Two algorithms namely multilayer neural networks (MLN) and weighted-K means adopted for datamining are employed in proposed approach to identify outliers in a data group. This approach guides and results in better cluster formation. Each element in the dataset provided as input to MLN after assigning weights by weighted K-means. MLN is trained to reproduce the normal input data (inliers) and ensures that groups formed by weighted K-means are consisting of inliers only. Among the outlier detection methods presented in literature for outlier detection in data mining, the proposed method is based on Integrating Semantic Knowledge. This method relates the data point is an outlier by identifying the behaviour of the data elements that differ from other data elements belonging to the same cluster or class. The principle intention of this research work is to reduce the amount of outliers by enhancing the performance of clustering or classification techniques that guides to improve accuracy and reduce the mean square error.

Principal contributions of the paper are: wavelet descriptor has been applied to extracting moment invariant shape future of hand gestures and possibility theory (PT) has been used for classification of gestures. Preprocessing and extraction of overlapping frames (start and end point of each gesture) are the other major events which have been solved using background modeling and novel gradient method. We have shown that the overlapping frames are helpful for fragmenting a continuous ISL gesture into isolated gestures. These isolated gestures are further processed and classified. During the segmentation process some of the geometrical features like shape and orientation of hand are deformed, which has been overcome by extracting a new moment invariant feature through wavelet descriptor. These features are then combined with the other two features (orientation and speed) and are classified using PT. Here we use PT in place of probability theory because possibility deals with the problem of uncertainty and impression whereas probability handles only uncertainty issues. Experiments have been performed on 20 sentences of continuous ISL gestures having 4000 samples where each sentence having 20 instances. In this dataset 50% samples have been used for training and 50% have been used for testing. From analysis of results we found that the proposed approach gives 92% classification accuracy with 20 subjects on continuous ISL gestures. This result has been compared with the results obtained with other classifiers like Hidden Markov Model and KNN and found 10% increment in the classification rate with proposed approach. These classified gestures are then combined for generating a sentence in the text format which is being matched with the knowledge database of NAO robot which has also increased the classification accuracy. These sentences are further converted in the form of speech or gesture using NAO robot. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Gesture recognition; ISL; NAO robot; Wavelet descriptor,Anthropomorphic robots; Audition; Classification (of information); Gesture recognition; Gradient methods; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Probability; Robots; Statistical tests; Text processing; Classification accuracy; Classification rates; Descriptors; Geometrical features; Hearing-impaired persons; Indian sign languages; Indian sign languages (ISL); Segmentation process; Human robot interaction,"Baranwal, N.; Robotics and AI Lab, Indian Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: baranwal.neha24@gmail.com",,Springer Netherlands,18754791,,,,English,Int.

The previous outcomes recommend that the overlapping between classes and the presence of noise have the most grounded impact on the performance of learning algorithm, and software defect datasets are no exceptions. The class overlap problem is concerned with the performance of machine learning classifiers critical problem is class overlap in which data samples appear as valid examples of more than one class which may be responsible for the presence of noise in datasets. We aim to investigate how the presence of overlapped instances in a dataset influences the classifier’s performance, and how to deal with class overlapping problem. To have a close estimate of class overlapping, we have proposed four different measures namely, nearest enemy ratio, subconcept ratio, likelihood ratio and soft margin ratio. We performed our investigations using 327 binary defect classification datasets obtained from 54 software projects, where we first identified overlapped datasets using three data complexity measures proposed in the literature. We also include treatment effort into the prediction process. Subsequently, we used our proposed measures to find overlapped instances in the identified overlapped datasets. Our results indicated that by training a classifier on a training data free from overlapped instances led to an improved classifier performance on the test data containing overlapped instances. The classifiers perform significantly better when the evaluation measure takes the effort into account. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Class overlapping; Data complexity measures; Data mining; Machine learning; Software defect prediction,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Defects; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Class overlapping; Classifier performance; Critical problems; Data complexity; Defect classification; Evaluation measures; Prediction process; Software defect prediction; Classification (of information),"Gupta, S.; Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing JabalpurIndia; email: shivani.panchal@iiitdmj.ac.in",,Springer-Verlag Wien,0010485X,,CMPTA,,English,Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009227462

Generally in MKL, the optimal kernel is defined as a combination of kernels under consideration (base kernels). In this paper, we formulated MKL using composite kernel functions (MKLCKF), in which the optimal kernel is represented as the linear combination of composite kernel functions. Corresponding to each data point a composite kernel function is designed whose domain is constructed as the direct product of the range space of base kernels, so that the composite kernels make use of the information of all the base kernels for finding their image. Thus MKLCKF has three layers in which the first layer consists of base kernels, the second layer consists of composite kernels and third layer is the optimal kernel which is a linear combination of the composite kernels. For making the algorithm more computationally effective, we formulated one more variation of the algorithm in which the coefficients of the linear combination are replaced with a similarity function that captures the local properties of the input data. We applied the proposed approach on a number of artificial intelligence applications and compared its performance with that of the other state-of-the-art techniques. Data compression techniques had been used for applying the models on large data, that is, for large scale classification, dictionary learning while for large scale regression pre-clustering approach had been applied. On the basis of the performance, rank was assigned to each model we used for analysis, The proposed models scored higher rank than the other models we used for comparison.

In the end, extensive experimentations are carried out over a novel database developed in our laboratory to compare performance of the proposed method to several competitive, state-of-the-art methods in order to check suitability of the proposed classification method for various real life applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Joint dynamic; Joint sparse representation; Kernel robust simultaneous sparse coding; Multimodal multivariate ear recognition; Sparse representation,Classification (of information); Query processing; Regression analysis; Statistics; Classification methods; Ear recognition; Joint dynamics; Multivariate regression; Sparse coding; Sparse representation; Sparse representation based classifications; State-of-the-art methods; Iterative methods,"Chatterjee, A.; Jadavpur University, Electrical Engg DepttIndia; email: cha_ami@yahoo.co.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9521976,,EAAIE,,English,Eng Appl Artif Intell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025631734

Soil classification aids farmers in deciding the type of crop to be sown for a particular type of soil. Similarly, wheat variety classification assists in selecting the right type of wheat for a particular product. Current methods used for classifying agricultural data are mostly manual. These methods involve agriculture field visits and surveys and are labor-intensive, expensive, and prone to human error. Recently, data mining techniques such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) have been used in classification of agricultural data such as soil, crops, and land cover. The resulting classification aid the decision making process of government organizations and agro-industries in the field of agriculture. SVM is a popular approach for data classification. A recent study on SVM highlighted the fact that using multiple kernels instead of a single kernel would lead to better performance because of the greater learning and generalization power. In this work, a hybrid kernel based support vector machine (H-SVM) is proposed for classifying multi-class agricultural datasets having continuous attributes. Genetic algorithm (GA) or gradient descent (GD) methods are utilized to select the SVM parameters C and ?. The proposed kernel is called the quadratic-radial-basis-function kernel (QRK) and it combines both quadratic and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The proposed classifier has the ability to classify all kinds of multi-class agricultural datasets with continuous features. Rigorous experiments using the proposed method are performed on standard benchmark and real world agriculture datasets. The results reveal a significant performance improvement over state of the art methods such as NB, k-NN, and SVM in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture; Classification; Hybrid; Kernels; SVM,Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Crops; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Radial basis function networks; Soils; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Continuous attribute; Decision making process; Government organizations; Hybrid; Kernels; Radial basis function kernels; Radial Basis Function(RBF); State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information),"Shastry, K.A.email: adityashastry.k@nmit.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

The face biometrics are one that possesses the merits of both high accuracy and low intrusiveness. An efficient machine recognition of human faces in big dataset is both important and challenging tasks. This paper addresses an intelligent face recognition system that is pose invariant and can recognize multi-expression, occluded and blurred faces through efficient but compact deep learning. Superior functionality of neural network in a complex domain has been observed in recent researches. My work presents a new approach, which is the fusion of higher-order novel neuron models with multivariate statistical techniques in a complex domain with a sole goal of improving performance of biometric systems. This also aims at reducing the computational cost and providing a faster recognition system. This paper presents the formal algorithms for feature extraction with multivariate statistical techniques in complex domain and compare them their real domain counterpart. This paper also presents a classifier structure (OCON : One-Class-in-One-Neuron) which contains an ensemble of novel higher order neurons, which drastically reduces the complexity of proposed learning machine because only single neuron is sufficient to recognize a subject in the database. This novel fusion in the proposed deep learning machine has thoroughly presented its superiority over a wide spectrum of experiments.

Effortless accessibility of these data attracts the researchers from diverse disciplines to process them for the benefit of the society. In the field of signal processing, a new area of research has been introduced namely genomic signal processing (GSP). GSP basically processes genes, proteins and DNA sequences using various signal processing methodologies to extract the information hidden in it. As some genetic abnormalities turn into cancer diseases, proper understanding and analysis of genes and proteins may lead to a new horizon in cancer genomic study. In genomic signal processing, exact identification and classification of diseased gene is a great challenge to the researchers. Hence in the present paper, the crucial job of gene identification and classification is attempted. As a solution to this problem, statistical methods like entropy estimation and mutual information calculation is adopted along with DSP technique. Rayleigh distribution of estimated entropy of gene is treated as identifier of healthy and cancerous Homo sapiens. Once the cancer genes are identified, mutual information estimator based on their minimum entropy is used as classifier to detect different types of cancer genes. The present algorithms are successfully tested on several healthy and cancerous prostate, breast and colon genes collected from NCBI genbank. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Biodiversity; Classification (of information); Diseases; DNA sequences; Entropy; Genes; Proteins; Entropy estimation; Gene identification; Genetic abnormality; Genomic-signal-processing; Microarray technologies; Mutual information calculations; Mutual informations; Rayleigh distributions; Signal processing,"Barman, S.; Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, University of CalcuttaIndia; email: barmanmandal@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,9467076,,,,English,Microsyst Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978035577

This requirement demands the need for noise free data or images. The existing partial differential equation based diffusion models can remove noise present in an image but lacking in preserving thin lines, fine details and sharp corners. The classifier algorithms can able to make correct judgement to which class the image belongs to only if all edges are preserved properly during denoising process. To satisfy this requirement the authors proposed a new improved partial differential equation based diffusion algorithm for edge preserving image denoising. The proposed new anisotropic diffusion algorithm is an extension of self-snake diffusion filter which estimates edge and gradient directions as eigenvectors of a structure tensor matrix. The unique feature of this proposed anisotropic diffusion algorithm is diffusion rate at various parts of an image matches with the speed of level set flow. In the proposed algorithm an efficient edge indicator function dependent on the trace of the structure tensor matrix is used. The proposed model performs best in preserving thin lines, sharp corners and fine details since diffusion happens only along edges and diffusion is totally stopped across edges in this model. The additional edge-stopping term which is a vector dot product of derivative of an edge stopping function and derivative of an image computed along gradient and edge orthogonal directions is used in this model as shock filter which enables increased sharpness at all discontinuities. The performance of proposed diffusion algorithm is compared with other classical diffusion filters like conventional perona-malik diffusion, conventional self-snake diffusion methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Anisotropic diffusion; Determinant of matrix; Edge stopping function; EigenVector; Enhancement; Perona-Malik model; Structure tensor matrix; Trace of matrix,Anisotropy; Classification (of information); Diffusion; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Image denoising; Image enhancement; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Optical anisotropy; Orthogonal functions; Partial differential equations; Predictive analytics; Tensors; Anisotropic Diffusion; Anisotropic diffusion model; Edge stopping functions; Orthogonal directions; Performance of classifier; Perona-Malik diffusions; Perona-malik models; Structure tensors; Edge detection,"Kamalaveni, V.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita UniversityIndia; email: v_kamalaveni@cb.amrita.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011923284

Information loss and common attacks possible on the anonymized data are serious challenges of anonymization. Recently, data anonymization using data mining techniques has showed significant improvement in data utility. Still the existing techniques lack in effective handling of attacks.

For designing of an efficient classification framework 480 MLO view digitized screen film mammographic images are taken from DDSM dataset. The ROIs of fixed size i.e. 128 × 128 pixels are cropped from the center area of the breast (i.e. the area where glandular ducts are prominent). A total of 292 texture features based on statistical methods, signal processing based methods and transform domain based methods are computed for each ROI. The computed feature vector is subjected to PCA for dimensionality reduction. The reduced feature space is fed to the classification module. In this work 4-class breast density classification has been conducted using hierarchical framework where the first classifier is used to classify an unknown test ROI into B-I/other class. If the test ROI is predicted as other class, it is inputted to second classifier for the classification into B-II/dense class. If the test ROI is predicted as belonging to dense class, it is inputted to classifier for the classification into B-III/B-IV class.

The obtained maximum OCA value is 80.4% using PCA-NFC in hierarchical approach. Further, the best performing individual classifiers are clubbed together in a hierarchical framework to design hybrid hierarchical framework for classification of breast density using digitized screen film mammograms.

Useful and interesting patterns can be identified with data collaboration. But, some of the sensitive patterns that are supposed to be kept private may be disclosed and such disclosure of sensitive patterns may effects the profits of the organizations that own the data. Hence the rules which are sensitive must be concealed prior to sharing the data. Concealing of sensitive patterns can be handled by modifying or reconstructing the database before sharing with others. However, to make the reconstructed database usable for data analysts the utility or usability of the database is to be maximized. Hence, both privacy and usability are to be balanced. A novel method is proposed to conceal the classification rules which are sensitive by reconstructing a new database. Initially, classification rules identified from the database are made accessible to the owner of the data to spot out the sensitive rules that are to be concealed.

The abnormality is identified through physical examination with a screening of blood smears. However, this method is error prone and labor intensive task for haematologist. Hence, haematologist needs a specific computer aided diagnostic system (CAD) that can deal with these limitations of prior systems and capable of discriminating immature leukemic cells from mature healthy cells. Thus, this work addresses the problem of segmenting a microscopic blood image into different regions, and then further analyzes those regions for localization of the immature lymphoblast cell. Further, it investigates the use of different geometrical, chromatic and statistical textures features for nucleus as well as cytoplasm and pattern recognition techniques for sub typing immature acute lymphoblasts as per FAB (French– American – British) classification. This can facilitate haematologist for acquiring essential information about prognosis and for an appropriate cure for leukemia. The exhaustive experiments have been conducted on 260 microscopic blood images (i.e. 130 normal and 130 cancerous cells) taken from ALL-IDB database. The proposed techniques consisting of the segmentation module used for segmenting the nucleus and cytoplasm of each leukocyte cell, feature extraction module, feature dimensionality reduction module that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to mapped the higher feature space to lower feature space and classification module that employs the standard classifiers, like support vector machines, smooth support vector machines, k-nearest neighbour, probabilistic neural network and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Chromatic features; Geometrical features; Hierarchical classifiers; Leukaemia; Principal Component Analysis; Statistical texture features,Blood; Cells; Cytology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Chromatic features; Geometrical features; Hierarchical classifiers; Leukaemia; Statistical texture features; Classification (of information),"Rawat, J.; G.B.

The classification of the images is one of the effective ways to manage and retrieve images. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale multimedia image data classification algorithm based on deep learning. We firstly select the image characteristics to represent the flag for retrieval, which represents the color, texture and shape characteristics respectively. A feature of color is the most basic image data, mainly including the average brightness, color histogram and dominant color, etc. What the texture refers to is the image data in the anomalous, macroscopic as well as orderly one key character that on partial has. The contour feature extraction of image data needs to rely on the edge detection, edge of the detected edge through the connection or grouping to form a meaningful image event. Secondly, we revise the convolutional neural network model based on the pooling operation optimization, the pooling is in the process of the convolution operation to extract the image characteristics of the different locations to gather statistics. Furthermore, we integrate the parallel and could storage strategy to enhance the efficiency of the proposed methodology. The performance of the algorithm is verified, compared with the other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed one obtains the better efficiency and accuracy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image data classification; Information retrieval; Large-scale system; Multimedia architecture,Classification (of information); Color; Convolution; Data mining; Digital storage; Edge detection; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Information retrieval; Large scale systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Search engines; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image characteristics; Image data; Multimedia architecture; Operation optimization; Shape characteristics; State-of-the-art approach; Image texture,"Li, J.; Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: lijuncas@163.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009863270

We present a novel benefit of voting, that has not been observed before: we can use the voting patterns to assess the performance of a team and predict their final outcome. This prediction can be executed at any moment during problem-solving and it is completely domain independent. Hence, it can be used to identify when a team is failing, allowing an operator to take remedial procedures (such as changing team members, the voting rule, or increasing the allocation of resources). We present three main theoretical results: (1) we show a theoretical explanation of why our prediction method works; (2) contrary to what would be expected based on a simpler explanation using classical voting models, we show that we can make accurate predictions irrespective of the strength (i.e., performance) of the teams, and that in fact, the prediction can work better for diverse teams composed of different agents than uniform teams made of copies of the best agent; (3) we show that the quality of our prediction increases with the size of the action space. We perform extensive experimentation in two different domains: Computer Go and Ensemble Learning. In Computer Go, we obtain high quality predictions about the final outcome of games. We analyze the prediction accuracy for three different teams with different levels of diversity and strength, and show that the prediction works significantly better for a diverse team. Additionally, we show that our method still works well when trained with games against one adversary, but tested with games against another, showing the generality of the learned functions. Moreover, we evaluate four different board sizes, and experimentally confirm better predictions in larger board sizes. We analyze in detail the learned prediction functions, and how they change according to each team and action space size. In order to show that our method is domain independent, we also present results in Ensemble Learning, where we make online predictions about the performance of a team of classifiers, while they are voting to classify sets of items. We study a set of classical classification algorithms from machine learning, in a data-set of hand-written digits, and we are able to make high-quality predictions about the final performance of two different teams.

We have also proposed a semi-supervised learning technique to learn different categories of crime events from the News documents. This helps in continuous evolution of the crime dictionaries. Thus the proposed methods are not restricted to detecting known crimes only but contribute actively towards maintaining an updated crime dictionary.

Of these, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults. Tumor biopsy being challenging for brain tumor patients, noninvasive techniques like imaging play an important role in the process of brain cancer detection, diagnosis and prognosis; particularly using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Therefore, development of advanced extraction and selection strategies of quantitative MRI features become necessary for noninvasively predicting and grading the tumors. In this paper we extract 56 three-dimensional quantitative MRI features, related to tumor image intensities, shape and texture, from 254 brain tumor patients. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier based on linguistic hedges (ANFC-LH) is developed to simultaneously select significant features and predict the tumor grade.

Despite the parallel and distributed ELM on MapReduce framework able to handle very large scale dataset for bigdata applications, the process of coping up with the rapidly updating data is a challenging one. Among the unified algorithms, the ELM with kernel uses kernels instead of random feature mappings. After, analyzing the property of ELM, it is observed that its most expensive computational part is matrix multiplication and matrix inversion. With the exponentially increasing volume of data, the matrix operations cannot be directly implemented on MapReduce. This paper proposes a novel approach, online sequential ELM with kernel (OS-ELM-Ker) based on sparsification criteria. Consequently, the efficient learning of frequently updated massive dataset is obtained.

Given a large variability in tissue appearance, to better capture discriminative traits, images can be acquired at different optical magnifications. In this paper, we propose an approach which utilizes joint colour-texture features and a classifier ensemble for classifying breast histopathology images. While we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an important objective of this work is to study the image classification across different optical magnification levels. We provide interesting experimental results and related discussions, demonstrating a visible classification invariance with cross-magnification training-testing.

The study focuses on extraction of significant features from raw EMG signals corresponding to six different grasping hand movements and then using them to classify the respective hand movements using different classifiers. We propose a hybrid multi-feature set comprising of Autoregressive (AR), Root Mean Square (RMS), Zero Crossing (ZC), Slope Sign Change (SSC), Waveform Length (WL) and Mean Absolute Value (MAV) time domain features. We use four different classifiers (k-NN, LDA, QDA and Subspace Discriminant Ensemble) for this experiment. Different set of features yield varying accuracies depending upon the choice of classifiers. Conventional AR feature set provides maximum accuracy of 80.83% with LDA classifier. Similarly, the feature set excluding AR obtains maximum accuracy of 72.5% with k-NN classifier. Our proposed multi-feature set of all six features provides the highest accuracy of 83.33% with Ensemble classifier which is significantly higher than the accuracy values of other feature sets.

Mutual information technique selects the input features of classifier by analyzing the relation between different features with attacks. The developed classifier is the integration of multiple support vector machine classifiers in which each classifier detect specific attack only.

Thus web is transforming into a huge repository of textual data, which can be classified to fathom the sentiment and emotional state of an online user. There are many text classification algorithms proposed by different researchers that take in texts from online media and after text preprocessing, mining and classification, the sentiment of a user is predicted. In this paper, we are proposing a Lexicon-based text classification algorithm which is used to analyze and predict a user's sentiment polarity viz. positive, negative & neutral from online reviews. Our algorithm is different from other Lexicon-based algorithms in the context that it uses the three degrees of comparison viz. positive, comparative and superlative degrees on words; for each of the positive and negative sentiment words. Further, we have used the negation words to show how the accuracy of the system can be improved. © 2016 IEEE.",Lexicon-Based Approach; Sentiment Analysis; Text Classification,Classification (of information); Metadata; Emotional state; Lexicon-based; Negative sentiments; Sentiment analysis; Space and time; Text classification; Text classification models; Text preprocessing; Text processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

As few years back, data mining was essential and vital to any sphere, so is the now the spectrum of privacy preserving data mining expanding with a thrust upon its applicability and efficacy. PPDM is a pool of solutions which takes care of shielding of data which has personal or private information and where any level of percolation of such information can be a cause of colossal and irreversible loss to an individual or business. At the same time, PPDM is also concerned with not compromising on the utility of other data which would be participating in mining. A balance between both the aspects: the secrecy and accuracy requires a smart balancing solution. Any algorithm suggested vary in several measures like efficiency, accuracy, data transfer costs, level of secrecy maintained, speed: to name a few. No algorithm is such that it can be generalized to perform superior to the rest. They are situation, domain and requirement specific. In this paper, an algorithm with a background framework for PPDM is proposed which anonymizes sensitive horizontal partitioned style distributed data, before they partake in collective mining process. Efforts have been made to conceal maximum personal information and not allowing it to affect on the results of mining. It is also kept in mind that the data transfer remains minimal during the entire process without distressing the quality of final findings. The experimental results and analysis is also presented for a detailed evaluation of the proposed method.

Importantly, there is a growing need for a better understanding of brain plasticity CP and the neural involvements for the initiation and control of these abilities so as to develop better rehabilitation programmes and external support devices. In this paper, we attempt to identify gait-related neural activities by decoding neural signals obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements while subjects performed three types of walking: without exoskeleton (free walking), and with exoskeleton support (zero force and assisting force). An average classification accuracy of 92.0% for training and 73.8% for testing sets was achieved using features extracted from mu and beta frequency bands. Furthermore, we found that mu band features contributed significantly to the classification accuracy and were localized mainly in sensorimotor regions that are associated with the control of the exoskeleton.

This paper proposes an efficient scheme known as semantic context model to derive high-level image descriptors well suited for the retrieval operation. Semantic context model uses an undirected graphical model based formulation which jointly exploits low-level visual features and contextual information for classifying local image blocks into some predefined concept classes. Contextual information involves concept co-occurrences and their spatial correlation statistics. More expressive potential functions are introduced to capture the structural dependencies among various semantic concepts. The proposed framework proceeds in three steps. Initially, optimal values of model parameters that impose spatial consistency of concept labels among local image blocks are learned from the training data. Then, the semantics associated with the constituent blocks of an unseen image are inferred using an improved message-passing algorithm. Finally, a compact but discriminative image signature is derived by integrating the frequency of occurrence of various regional semantics. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that semantic context model can effectively resolve local ambiguities and consequently improve concept recognition performance in complex images. Moreover, the retrieval efficiency of the new semantics based image feature is found to be much better than state-of-the-art approaches. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Contextual information; Graphical models; Image retrieval; Semantic gap,Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Graphic methods; Image classification; Message passing; Semantic Web; Semantics; Speech recognition; Contextual information; GraphicaL model; Image representations; Message passing algorithm; Retrieval efficiency; Semantic gap; Spatial correlations; State-of-the-art approach; Image retrieval,"Arun, K.S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: iamarunks@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,18688071,,,,English,Intl.

Hence, the early detection of cardiac diseases based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is important for delivering appropriate and timely treatment to the heart patients and it is increasing the heart patient’s survival. Recent trends in clinical decision making systems appeal automation in ECG signal processing and beat classification. Automatic beat classification is a significant method to support clinical specialists to categorize arrhythmia signals in ECG recording. The main objective of this paper is to construct novel automatic classification system for analysis of ECG signal and decision making purposes. The proposed method involves three main parts: De-noising, feature extraction and classification. Initially, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied before classification for signal De-noising and feature extraction. In this work, neighborhood rough set is applied to classify the ECG signals into normal and four abnormal heart beats. The presence of neighborhood rough set classification algorithm (NRSC) produces very exciting recognition and classification abilities through a wide range of biomedical signal processing. The experimental analysis of the proposed NRSC algorithm is compared with the multi-layered perceptron, decision table, Naïve Bayes and J48 classification algorithms. Here, the performance of classification algorithms has been evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false predictive value, Matthews’s correlation coefficients, F-measure, Folke–Mallows Index and Kulcznski Index. The acquired results showed that the proposed algorithm attained 99.32 % of the classification accuracy using NRSC and DWT.

In addition to the local gradient features i.e. histogram oriented feature and grid level feature, an additional feature called GLCM feature is extracted from the input image in the proposed recognition system and are concatenated for the image recognition procedure to encode color, shape, texture, local as well as the statistical information. These extracted features considered are given to the hybrid classifier which recognises the character. In the test set, recognition accuracy of 95% is achieved. The proposed probabilistic model based hybrid classifier tends to contribute more accurate character recognition rate compared to the existing character recognition system. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",decision tree classifier; GLCM feature; histogram oriented gradient feature; hybrid classifier,Classification (of information); Decision trees; Graphic methods; Image recognition; Character recognition system; Decision tree classifiers; GLCM feature; Hand written character recognition; Hybrid classifier; Oriented gradients; Probabilistic modeling; Statistical information; Character recognition,,,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Fusion of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and FrDCT is used in this paper for gender classification. Initially, 1-level DWT is calculated for 128 × 128 resized input images. LL sub-band images are then input to FrDCT which transforms the images into u-domain which is at an angle ? from spatial domain axis. FrDCT transformed images are used to generate a feature vector based on 8 × 8 non-overlapping sub-blocks. Dividing an image into sub-blocks helps to remove the local spatial correlation. Thus, proposed technique maintains the computational cost as that in other existing techniques. Rbf kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the images on the basis of gender.

SAMOA stands for scalable advanced massive online analysis, is a machine learning framework used to perform distributed data mining over streaming data. Vertical Hoeffding Tree (VHT) under SAMOA is a variant of very fast decision tree used for distributed classification of data streams. The performance of VHT depends on various critical parameters such as tie-threshold, grace value, confidence, split criterion, etc. Although, VHT is widely accepted as an efficient streaming classifier but one of the challenges in streaming classification is varying distribution of incoming data instances with respect to underlying classes in different datasets; therefore performance of VHT varies in different datasets. Therefore, achieving optimal performance from the stream classifier like VHT on different datasets is a challenging task and fixed set of values of critical parameters cannot be preconfigured for various types of datasets. This research work explores the capabilities of VHT streaming classifier of SAMOA in the light of various benchmarking performance statistics such as classification accuracy, kappa and kappa temporal. The work presented here, experimentally identifies suitable values of critical parameters of VHT that yield optimized performance on different datasets. Thus, this analytical study is extremely significant in developing streaming classifiers which achieve optimum performance via parameter tuning at run time. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Massive online analysis; SAMOA; Streaming data classification; Streaming data mining; Vertical Hoeffding Tree; VFDT; VHT,Benchmarking; Big data; Data communication systems; Data mining; Decision trees; Digital storage; Trees (mathematics); On-line analysis; SAMOA; Streaming data; Vertical Hoeffding Tree; VFDT; Classification (of information),"Prasad, B.R.; Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, Jhalwa, India; email: rs151@iiita.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,18688071,,,,English,Intl.

In this paper, we propose two feature extraction approaches to classify five types of heartbeats: normal, premature ventricular contraction, atrial premature contraction, left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block. In the first approach, ECG beats are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Later four parameters, namely the sample entropy, coefficient of variation, singular values, and band power of IMFs are extracted as features. In the second approach, the same features are computed from IMFs extracted using an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm. The features obtained from the two approaches are independently fed to the sequential minimal optimization-support vector machine (SMO-SVM) for classification. We used two arrhythmia databases for our evaluation: MIT-BIH and INCART. We compare the proposed approaches with existing methods using the performance measures given by the average values of (i) specificity, (ii) sensitivity, and (iii) accuracy. The first approach demonstrates significant performance with 98.01% sensitivity, 99.49% specificity, and 99.20% accuracy for the MIT-BIH database and 95.15% sensitivity, 98.37% specificity, and 97.57% accuracy for the INCART database. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Arrhythmia; Classification; ECG signal; Empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; SMO-SVM,Classification (of information); Database systems; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Feature extraction; Optimization; Signal processing; Arrhythmia; ECG signals; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; SMO-SVM; Support vector machines; Article; decomposition; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; electroencephalography; entropy; heart beat; heart left bundle branch block; heart right bundle branch block; heart ventricle extrasystole; nonlinear system; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; supraventricular premature beat; electrocardiography; heart rate; human; procedures; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Nonlinear Dynamics; Support Vector Machine,"Rajesh, K.N.V.P.S.; School of Electronics Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: kandala.rajesh2014@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,28624712,English,Comput.

These data are liable to missing values since there are situations, where the patient observations are neither done regularly nor updated correctly. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to impute missing values in an unevenly spaced clinical time-series data by proposing a tolerance rough set induced bio-statistical (TRiBS) framework. The proposed framework adopts an inverse distance weight (IDW) interpolation technique and improves it using the concept of tolerance rough set (TR) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). METHOD: To interpolate an unknown data point, the classical IDW interpolation suffers from two major drawbacks: first, in selecting the known data points and second, choosing an optimal influence factor. TRiBS framework overcomes the first limitation using TR and the second using PSO. TR derives the dependent attributes for each attribute using non-missing records. The nearest significant set is then generated for each missing value based on its attribute dependencies. The PSO technique fixes the weights for the data in a nearest significant set by finding an optimized influence factor. The obtained significant set and its influence factor are used in IDW computations to impute missing value. RESULT: The proposed work is experimented using clinical time series dataset of hepatitis and thrombosis patients. However, the proposed system can support other clinical time series dataset with minor domain specific changes. CONCLUSION: The performance of the imputed results proves the effectiveness of TRiBS. Experimental evaluation with the classifiers such as neural networks, support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree have shown an improvement in the classification accuracy when a missing data is pre-processed with the proposed framework. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Inverse distance weight; Missing value; Particle swarm optimization; Time series; Tolerance rough set,Autocorrelation; Data mining; Decision trees; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Network function virtualization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Rough set theory; Support vector machines; Time series; Trees (mathematics); Classification accuracy; Clinical time series; Experimental evaluation; Interpolation techniques; Inverse distance weight; Missing values; Temporal classification; Tolerance rough sets; Classification (of information),"Khanna, N.H.; Ramanujan Computing Centre, Anna UniversityIndia; email: nehemiah@annauniv.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,1679473,,CSDAD,,English,Comput.

One of such data analysis task in dynamic environment is to design an incremental classifier for decision making and consequently updating the knowledge base of the overall system. Classifier construction depicts extraction of interesting patterns from the large repository of data and predicts the future trends based on the existing patterns. The time complexity of the classification system increases gradually and the system becomes inefficient while it is learned repeatedly for adding new group of data with the existing one in a certain interval of time. Without learning the same classifier for the whole data, if the knowledge of old data extracted by the classifier is used together with the new group of data to design the updated classifier, called incremental classifier, then time complexity reduces drastically. In the paper, the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization technique and Association Rule Mining are used to design an incremental rule based classification system. The incremental classifier is suitable to apply on rice disease dataset for disease prediction as the characteristics of rice diseases change in time due to change of climate, biological, and geographical factors. The proposed method has been applied on both simulated rice disease dataset and benchmark datasets and the classification accuracy is measured and compared with various state of the art classification algorithms. The method is also evaluated based on some statistical measures and statistical test is done to establish its significance and effectiveness. © 2017",Data mining; Dynamic classifier; Incremental data; Particle Swarm Optimization; Rice disease,Climate change; Data handling; Data mining; Education; Evolutionary algorithms; Information analysis; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification system; Dynamic classifiers; Incremental data; Particle swarm optimization technique; Rule-based classification system; Statistical measures; Classification (of information); complexity; data mining; data set; decision making; design; disease; equipment; optimization; prediction; rice,"Sengupta, S.; Department of Information Technology, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, India; email: shampa2512@yahoo.co.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1681699,,CEAGE,,English,Comput.

Thus, it has become a tough challenge to search for a particular document from such a large volume of collections. Text classification is a technique which can speed up the search and retrieval tasks and hence is the need of the hour. Aiming in this direction, this study proposes an efficient technique that uses the concept of connected component (CC) of a graph and Wordnet along with four established feature selection techniques [e.g., TF-IDF, Chi-square, Bi-Normal Separation (BNS) and Information Gain (IG)] to select the best features from a given input dataset in order to prepare an efficient training feature vector. Next, multilayer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) (which is based on the architecture of deep learning) and other state-of-the-art classifiers are trained on this efficient training feature vector for classification of text data. The experimental work has been carried out on DMOZ and 20-Newsgroups datasets. We have studied the behavior and compared the results of different classifiers using these four important feature selection techniques used for classification process and observed that ML-ELM achieved the maximum overall F-measure of 72.28 % on DMOZ dataset using TF-IDF as the feature selection technique and 81.53 % on 20-Newsgroups dataset using BNS as the feature selection technique compared to other state-of-the-art classifiers which signifies the usefulness of deep learning used by ML-ELM for classifying the text data.

In particular, bioscience and medical datasets routinely contain several thousands of features. For effective data mining in such databases, many methods and techniques have been developed. Rough set is a mathematical theory for dealing with uncertainty. In dominance-based rough set extension of rough set, the set of objects partitioned into pre-defined and preference-ordered classes, the new rough set approach is able to approximate this partition by means of dominance relations. This paper suggests improved dominance-based rough set for classification of medical data. Dominance-based rough set can handle ordinal attribute. This paper proposed a technique for applying dominance-based rough set for nominal attribute. This proposed work suggests decision table to determine dominance relation, and then improved dominance-based rough set is applied to find lower, upper, boundary approximations in the entire dataset. Then attribute reduction based on proposed technique is applied to find the essential attribute required for classification. This proposed method can accurately classify medical datasets collected from UCI repository Web sites. This proposed method works in seven different datasets: They are heart disease dataset, Pima Indian diabetes dataset, Breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, heart valve dataset, jaundice datasets, dermatology dataset and lung cancer dataset.

These differences in speech may be due to the individual’s age; gender; or speaking style influenced by his dialect. Undoubtedly, the focus of research in this field is to strengthen further the techniques developed thus far, regarding their reliability and accuracy. The endeavour of this research paper is to primarily concentrate on analysis and modelling of linguistic and paralinguistic information embedded in the speech signal for discovering the similarities and dissimilarities among acoustic characteristics arising out of different dialects. This paper investigates the influence of dialectal variations, by measuring and analysing certain acoustic features such as formant frequencies, pitch, pitch slope, duration and intensity of vowel sounds. For automatic identification of native dialect, these differences are further exploited, given a sample of native speaker’s speech. For the classification of dialect in the spoken utterances support vector machines along with dialect-specific Gaussian mixture models were used. The system performance is compared with human perception of dialects. The proposed study focuses on various dialects of one of the world’s major language; Hindi. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Acoustic feature; Dialect identification; Gaussian mixture model; Human perception; Support vector machine,Automation; Classification (of information); Communication channels (information theory); Gaussian distribution; Linguistics; Object recognition; Speech; Speech communication; Support vector machines; Acoustic characteristic; Acoustic features; Automatic identification; Automatic speech recognition; Dialect identification; Gaussian Mixture Model; Human perception; Paralinguistic information; Speech recognition,"Sinha, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: meshweta_7@rediffmail.com",,Springer Netherlands,2692821,,AIRVE,,English,Artif Intell Rev,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026439817

A robot, which could be controlled from a distant location, can solve these problems. This could be via communication waves or networking methods. Also controlling should be real time and so smooth that it can actuate on every minor signal in an effective way. Robot control through hand gesture in real time has been an investigative area among researchers. This paper discusses a method controlling a robot over the network from a distant location. The robot is controlled by hand gestures which were captured by camera live. A DSP board TMS320DM642EVM was used to implement image pre-processing and fastening the system. PCA was used for gesture classification and robot actuation would happen according to predefined procedures. Classification information was sent over the network in the experiment.

The literature presents different spatial data mining methods to mine knowledge from spatial databases. In this paper, spatial association rules are mined to automatic grouping of spatial data objects using a candidate generation process with three constraint measures, such as support, confidence, and lift. Then, the proposed multiple kernel-based probabilistic clustering is applied to the associate vector to further group the spatial data objects. Here, membership probability based on probabilistic distance is used with multiple kernels, where exponential and tangential kernel functions are utilized. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed with three data sets of three different geometry types using the number of rules and clustering accuracy. From the experimentation, the results proved that the proposed multi-kernel probabilistic clustering algorithm achieved better accuracy as compared with the existing probabilistic clustering. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",association rule mining; clustering; kernel; probabilistic clustering; Spatial database,Association rules; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Data mining; Database systems; Geographic information systems; Maps; Query languages; clustering; Environmental assessment; kernel; Membership probability; Probabilistic clustering; Probabilistic distance; Spatial association rules; Spatial database; Clustering algorithms,"Jayababu, Y.; Department of CSE, Pragati Engineering CollegeIndia; email: jayababuy2015@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023195890

This paper presents and discusses several experiments using a variety of classifiers. The goal of this research is to determine the degree to which such postings can be authenticated as coming from the purported user and not from an intruder. Various sets of stylometry and ad hoc social networking features were developed to categorize 9259 posts from 30 Facebook authors as authentic or non-authentic. An algorithm to utilize machine-learning classifiers for investigating this problem is described, and an additional voting algorithm that combines three classifiers is investigated. This research is one of the first works that focused on authorship authentication in short messages, such as postings on social network sites. The challenges of applying traditional stylometry techniques on short messages are discussed. Experimental results demonstrate an average accuracy rate of 79.6% among 30 users. Further empirical analyses evaluate the effect of sample size, feature selection, user writing style, and classification method on authorship authentication, indicating varying degrees of success compared with previous studies.

Now a day the attacks motive has changed from simple hacking, damaging to large scale network and server system. In the presence of fresh and formerly unknown activities, intrusion detection rate is inaccurate and low. Many research works are focused in this area. In all the security infrastructures, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have grown a standard and in separable component. For this reason, a new model has been proposed based on Big Data for detecting unknown attacks. The core idea of this paper is to analyze the activity of the network users, and to classify whether the user is normal or anomaly. For implementation of this project, we have used the snort, the tools which are used to capture the online behavior of network users. After collecting the network behavior, the dataset was analyzed with hadoop framework using C4.5 classification. The performance of the project was compared with KDD Dataset. The proposed approach improves the IDS performance and its capability is to provide quick response to various types of network attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",Big-Data Analysis; Hadoop; Machine Learning; Security; Snort,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data handling; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Personal computing; Hadoop; Intrusion Detection Systems; Large-scale network; Network intrusion detection systems; Security; Security infrastructure; Security technology; Snort; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, our motive is to develop a recommender system that is based on user assigned tags and content present on web pages. Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation. © 2017 IEEE.",K-NN; Privacy; recall; Recommender Systems; Social; Tag,Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Data privacy; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; User interfaces; Websites; K-nearest neighbours; Quality of recommendations; recall; Social; Social tagging systems; Supervised machine learning; Tag recommendations; Tag recommender systems; Recommender systems,,Qiu M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. -IEEE Int.

The geometrical, shape and orientation features have been used to correctly classify the segmented objects as exudates or false pixels. The proposed technique has a high specificity and eliminates false positives correctly when applied across a wide range of images. The exudates segmented have a high degree of accuracy and no false positives are generated in case of non-diseased images. The proposed method has been tested on a total 189 images of the DIARETDB1 and MESSIDOR database and achieves an accuracy of 92.13% and 90% respectively.

Such ambiguity originates naturally or from misinterpretation, faulty encoding, and/or incompleteness of data. However, most applications demand that a data point be assigned a single label. In such cases, the supervised learner must resolve the ambiguity. To effectively perform ambiguity resolution, we propose a new variant of the popular Multi-Layer Perceptron model, called the Generalized Mean Multi-Layer Perceptron (GMMLP). In GMMLP, a novel differentiable error function guides the back-propagation algorithm towards the minimum distant target for each data point. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against three alternative ambiguity resolvers on 20 new artificial datasets containing ambiguous data points.

The study of the Computed Tomography (CT) images considers image segmentation a very important and vital part in identifying the different kinds of tumor. The classification of the tumor and the non-tumor images followed by the segmentation of tumor region in CT images is done by the proposed methodology. The process of classifying is carried out by Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernel functions and optimization techniques. This SVM classifier with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is predominant over the other methodologies in the analysis of classification process. The segmentation process after the classification process is performed by the Modified Region Growing (MRG) with threshold optimization. As regards the threshold optimization, certain algorithms such as Harmony Search (HS), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) are made use of. It is with the aid of a wide set of performance measures that the results are demonstrated. The comparative analysis in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy is done for the optimization techniques said supra. An accuracy rate of 99.05% in the analysis of segmentation process is obtained using the GWO technique. It is in the working platform of MATLAB that this proposed methodology is implemented.

Farmers usually select crop for cultivation according to their traditional knowledge and past experience in farming, but a farmer’s predictions may go wrong due to natural disaster. Thus, decision-making tool need to be developed to help farmers to take decision on crop cultivation. In this paper, decision-making tool was developed for selecting the suitable crop that can be cultivated in a given agricultural land. In the present study, 26 input variables were identified and categorized into six broad heads of main variables such as soil, water, season, input, support and infrastructure. Each main variable has several sub-variables. The priority weights for the variables were determined using the dominance-based rough set approach. In order to convert sub-variable sequences to main variable sequences, evaluation scores of each main variable were calculated by applying the weights of sub-variables and by using simple additive method. Finally, the evaluation scores were applied to Johnson’s reduct algorithm and classification rules were generated. The developed tool predicts each site in the datasets into one of the three crops such as paddy, groundnut and sugarcane. In order to validate the performance of the tool, the same datasets were predicted again by agriculture experts. The results obtained from the tool showed 92% agreement with the results obtained from the experts. Thus, the tool is a feasible tool for cultivating the suitable crops in the agricultural sites. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Agriculture; Classification; Crop selection; Dominance-based rough set approach; Johnson’s reduct,Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Disasters; Rough set theory; Agricultural sites; Agriculture development; Classification rules; Competitive environment; Crop selections; Decision making tool; Dominance-based rough set approach; Traditional knowledge; Agriculture,"Deepa, N.; School of Information Technology & Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: deepa.rajesh@vit.ac.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

This approach is considered than the other biometric authentication methods such as behavioral biometrics which specially includes Keystroke, Speaker Recognition whereas the another side of biometric authentication is Physical biometrics which specially includes Fingerprint Recognition, Voice Recognition, Finger Geometry Recognition and Facial Recognition. From these considerations, the hybrid approach of Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial for iris recognition has been proposed. The novelty of this proposed method results in improving the Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) for the given iris image. In addition to this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for iris image pre-processing. Circular Hough transform (CHT) and Canny edge detection (CED) are applied for iris image segmentation which segments the individual region of the input images. After the image is segmented, Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial have been applied to extract the features from the segmented iris image, which is the most important step for obtaining the texture details, which are independent and uncorrelated even for identical pairs. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for image classification. Perhaps, Feature extraction and Classification of iris image are mainly based on the rich texture details present in iris image. Finally, our proposed system is applied on UBIRIS database and our research experiment provides better accuracy and recognition rates compared to the combined iris recognition techniques such as Fourier transform with SVM, Bernstein polynomial with SVM, Fourier transform with KSVM, Bernstein polynomial with KSVM and hybridization of Fourier and Bernstein polynomial with SVM. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bernstein polynomial; Canny edge detection; Circular Hough transform; Equal error rate; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Fourier transform; Iris image segmentation; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machine; Uncorrelated texture,Authentication; Biometrics; Classification (of information); Digital filters; Edge detection; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Fourier transforms; Hough transforms; Image classification; Image processing; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Polynomials; Singular value decomposition; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Bernstein polynomial; Canny edge detection; Circular Hough transforms; Equal error rate; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Image texture,"Ramya, M.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PSG College of TechnologyIndia; email: ramyam7708@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,1678655,,,,English,Pattern Recogn.

In the case of a partial epilepsy, some portions of the brain is affected and the EEG measured from that portions are called as Focal EEG and the EEG measured from other regions is termed as Non Focal EEG. The identification of Focal EEG assists the doctors in finding the epileptogenic focus and thereby go for surgical removal of those portions of the brain for those who are having drug resistant epilepsy. In this work, we have proposed a classification methodology to classify Focal and Non Focal EEG. We used the Bern Barcelona database and used entropies such as Approximate entropy (ApEn), Sample entropy (SampEn) and Reyni's entropy as features. These features were fed into six different classifiers such as Naïve Bayes (NBC), Radial Basis function (RBF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), KNN classifier, Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars classifier (NNge) and Best First Decision Tree (BFDT) classifier. It was found that NNge classifier gave the highest accuracy of 98%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%, which is the highest comparing to other methods in the literature. In addition to the above, the maximum computation time of our features is 0.054 seconds which opens the window for real time processing.

The essential parameters such as huge training dataset size, recognition accuracy and computational complexity need to be considered while designing a practical TSR system. In this paper, we have used higher order spectra (HOS) coupled with texture based features to develop an efficient TSR model.

These huge data repositories can range from patient personnel data, diagnosis, treatment histories, test diagnosis, images and various scans. This terabytes of medical data is quantity rich but weaker in information in terms of knowledge and robust tools to identify hidden patterns of knowledge specifically in medical sector. Data Mining as a field of research has already well proven capabilities of identifying hidden patterns, analysis and knowledge applied on different research domains, now gaining popularity day by day among researchers and scientist towards generating novel and deep insights of these large biomedical datasets also. Uncovering new biomedical and healthcare related knowledge in order to support clinical decision making, is another dimension of data mining. Through massive literature survey, it is found that early disease prediction is the most demanded area of research in health care sector. As health care domain is bit wider domain and having different disease characteristics, different techniques have their own prediction efficiencies, which can be enhanced and changed in order to get into most optimize way.

Data stream is continuous, ordered sequence of data instances arriving at a rapid rate. One of the key challenges while learning from data streams is the detection of concept drift, i.e., changes in data distribution underlying data streams, observed over time. Drifts being either gradual or sudden, several algorithms have been put forward for detection of different kinds of drift. However, most of them work on only one of these kinds of drift. These algorithms show hampered output if different types of drift are mixed. To solve this issue, there is need of a single system that can handle all drifts simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a system that detects both kinds of drift efficiently. Our system combines features of the online classifier as well as a blockbased classifier to achieve the goal. We further analyzed drifts to find out missing values of attributes to be the root cause. Our system handles missing values in different ways for more improved performance. © 2017 IEEE.",Block-based classifier; Concept drift; Data stream mining; Ensemble; Missing values; Online classifier,Data communication systems; Sensor networks; Block based; Concept drifts; Data stream mining; Ensemble; Missing values; On-line classifier; Classification (of information),,PadmaSai Y.Garg D.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

For classification, we employ a custom kernel support vector machines that is trained for each attribute to obtain binary classifiers which are then used to predict the labels for an unknown business. However, central to our approach is the mining of association rules between different labels to further increase the accuracy of the proposed system.

After learning, one-class SVM detects abnormal events in the frame. The algorithm is fast with improved accuracy since it omits the background subtraction step and adopts hierarchy.

As it's an important task to reach consumer's demand for good quality mango, automation in grading of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) is required. This paper is addressing the grading issue of agricultural produce based on its maturity and size. The Fuzzy inference system is used for decision-making process. Prediction of mango's maturity is done through its skin's color but for some exceptional tribe of mango like 'Langdo', skin color will remain the same for its lifetime. In such cases, normal imaging (reflective imaging) will not work for predicting its maturity. One can use infrared, x-ray or thermal imaging for maturity prediction. Here mango grading is performed based on maturity and size feature. For that, with mean intensity algorithm in L?a?b? color space and FLIR ONE thermal camera is used to predict the maturity of mango. Size of mangois predicted by three parameters namely weight, eccentricity and area. Fuzzy classifier is used for predicting size feature. To grade mango decision making theory is used and mango is graded in two different classes.

Many times an analyst may end up with an erroneous classifier because of huge, redundant, unreliable and noisy data. It may also be due to misinterpretation of results and usage of inappropriate techniques for a specific situation. In our study, we have investigated the two main approaches in data mining which are Decision Tree (J48 algorithm) and Ensemble Learning Technique (AdaBoost). We have also performed a comparative analysis of these two techniques. The tool which we have used is WEKA which is an open source's software. The datasets which we have used are supermarket.arff, labor.arff, soybean.arff, & segment.arff. Here. arff is an abbreviation of Attribute Relation file Format which is the standard format that is accepted by WEKA for the datasets. The sample size of training set is number of attributes and number of instances available in the dataset. Classification models are assessed on the basis of number of class labels in the dataset, accuracy, amount and length of the generated rules, error rate and standard deviation. Based on number of experiments which we have performed, results show that AdaBoost provides better accuracy than Decision Tree (J48 algorithm) when the number of class labels in the dataset are exactly two whereas the Decision Tree generate rules faster than the Adaboost and when number of class labels in the dataset are more than two then J48 algorithm performs better than Adaboost. The results show the tradeoff of using the two approaches for other researchers in finding the best model for a particular problem. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Decision Tree,Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Open source software; Open systems; Trees (mathematics); Classification models; Comparative analysis; Ensemble learning; Machine learning techniques; Number of class; Standard deviation; Standard format; Training sets; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"India Int.

However, the need to respond to projections requests in a timely manner in the face of rapidly evolving applications and software stacks and tight schedule constraints, often preclude design teams from executing detailed workload analysis, sampling and simulation flows for such purposes. We address this problem by taking advantage of the large amount of data that performance modeling teams commonly generate as part of architectural studies across thousands of workload scenarios. We propose two methods for exploiting these datasets: one that builds proxy suites, and another that builds decision-Tree based classifiers. Both methods can generate IPC estimates for a target workload without collecting new workload samples, or running a single additional simulation. We discuss our experience using these techniques to estimate the IPC of numerous commercial workloads on four industrial x86 processor designs. The resulting IPC estimates were on average, within 2% of those obtained via measurements or detailed cycle-Accurate simulations Importantly, using these methods, we were able to generate IPC estimates for a target workload in a matter of hours to 1-2 days, compared to several weeks using conventional approaches. © 2017 IEEE.",,Application programs; Classification (of information); Computer software; Decision trees; Architectural studies; Commercial workload; Conventional approach; Cycle-accurate simulation; Performance Model; Performance projections; Processor design; Workload analysis; Multitasking,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,ISPASS - IEEE Int.

The prediction of kidney disease is highly complex task while handling huge dataset. The kidney disease dataset contain patients information such as age, blood Pressure levels, albumin, sugar, counts of red blood cells etc., in the dataset there may be some missing values in some features that values may be important to predict kidney disease. Due to such missing values in the dataset will decrease the accuracy of kidney disease prediction. Several methods were proposed to fill up these missing values. An existing classification framework used a data preprocessing method but here the data cleaning process has been made in order to fill the missing values and to correct the erroneous ones. A recalculation process is performed on the chronic Kidney disease (CKD) stages and the values were recalculated and filled in for unknown values. Though this method is efficient, the influence of expert in the field of healthcare dataset values for CKD is needed. So to avoid this need and improve the preprocessing as a layman, Weighted Average Ensemble Learning Imputation (WAELI) is proposed. In this proposed work the single value imputation model used expectation-maximization (EM) and Random Forest (RF) which predict the missing values effectively in small dataset. For huge dataset the multiple value imputation model predict the missing values with the help of RF, Classification And Regression Tree, C4.5 are used to estimate the missing value. Hence the accuracy of kidney disease prediction will be improved by using WAELI. Then introducing priority assigning algorithm to assign priority for each features in the dataset then higher priority features are carried over for classification process. This makes classification process more efficient and time consumption for classification will be reduced. © 2017 IEEE.",C4.5; CART; CKD EPI; EM; Priority assigning algorithm; RF; WAELI,Autocorrelation; Blood pressure; Decision trees; Forecasting; Maximum principle; C4.5; CART; CKD EPI; Classification and regression tree; Classification framework; Classification process; Expectation Maximization; WAELI; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The need is to develop algorithms that can adapt across domains by leveraging labeled data from source domain(s) and effIciently perform the task in the unlabeled target domain. Towards this, we present a novel two-stage neural network learning algorithm for domain adaptation which learns a multi-part hidden layer where individual parts contribute differently to the tasks in source and target domains. The multiple parts of the representation (i.e. hidden layer) are learned while being cognizant of what characteristics to transfer across domains and what to preserve within domains for enhanced performance. The First stage embroils around learning a two-part representation i.e. source specific and common representations in a manner such that the former do not detract the ability of the later to represent the target domain. In the second stage, the generalized common representation is further iteratively extended with discriminating target specific characteristics to adapt to the target domain. We empirically demonstrate that the learned representations, in difierent arrangements, outperform existing domain adaptation algorithms in the source classification as well as the cross-domain classification tasks on the user generated content from different domains on the web. © 2017 ACM.",Domain Adaptation; Neural Networks; Text Classification; Transfer Learning,Classification (of information); Hypertext systems; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Text processing; Classification tasks; Different domains; Domain adaptation; Neural network learning algorithm; Source classification; Text classification; Transfer learning; User-generated content; Education,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,HT - Proc.

In the proposed method, GIST descriptors of the traffic sign images are extracted and subjected to graph-based linear discriminant analysis to reduce the dimension. Moreover, it effectively learns the discriminative subspace through the graph structure with increased computational efficiency. An efficient TSR module is built by conducting series of experiments using support vector machine, extreme learning machine, and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers on available public datasets. Our approach achieved the highest recognition accuracy of 96.33 and 97.79% using k-NN classifier for German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and Belgium Traffic Sign Classification Benchmark (BelgiumTSC), respectively.

Common classifiers when trained by imbalanced data tend to bias towards the class possessing bulk instances causing misclassification of upcoming patterns/instances. The study reveals that presence of redundant borderline instances and outliers in the data-space severely catalyzes the effect of class imbalance. The Condensed Nearest Neighbor and Tomek-link undersampling techniques are used as the baseline systems for the present study, and an improved undersampling algorithm is proposed to be employed in the pre-processing stage by amalgamating aspects of outlier and redundancy detection to the baseline system. The proposed scheme imparts to detect outlier, redundant and noisy instances having least contribution in estimating accurate class labels. Thus, a data-level solution has been offered to the concerned problem with novelty in effective elimination of majority instances without losing valuable information. The proposed scheme is implemented and validated with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), K-Nearest-Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers for 10 real-life datasets.

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other HE-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Annotation; boundaries; dataset; deep learning; nuclear segmentation; nuclei,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Object recognition; Pathology; Quality control; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Tissue; Annotation; dataset; Image processing technique; nuclei; Publicly accessible; Segmentation results; Segmentation techniques; Watershed segmentation; Image segmentation; algorithm; cell nucleus; human; image processing; machine learning; staining; Algorithms; Cell Nucleus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Staining and Labeling","Kumar, N.; IIT GuwahatiIndia; email: neeraj.kumar.iitg@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2780062,,ITMID,28287963,English,IEEE Trans.

In this work, we have developed a classifier fusion based dynamic free-air hand gesture recognition system to identify the isolated gestures. Different users gesticulate at different speed for the same gesture. Hence, when comparing different samples of the same gesture, variations due to difference in gesturing speed should not contribute to the dissimilarity score. Thus, we have introduced a two-level speed normalization procedure using DTW and Euclidean distance-based techniques. Three features such as ‘orientation between consecutive points’, ‘speed’ and ‘orientation between first and every trajectory points’ were used for the speed normalization. Moreover, in feature extraction stage, 44 features were selected from the existing literatures. Use of total feature set could lead to overfitting, information redundancy and may increase the computational complexity due to higher dimension. Thus, we have tried to overcome this difficulty by selecting optimal set of features using analysis of variance and incremental feature selection techniques. The performance of the system was evaluated using this optimal set of features for different individual classifiers such as ANN, SVM, k-NN and Naïve Bayes. Finally, the decisions of the individual classifiers were combined using classifier fusion model. Based on the experimental results it may be concluded that classifier fusion provides satisfactory results compared to other individual classifiers.

Neither a universal solution nor an absolute strategy for its evaluation exists in the literature. In this context, through this paper, we make following three contributions: (1) A new method for finding ‘natural groupings’ or clusters in the data set is presented. For this, a new term ‘vicinity’ is coined. Vicinity captures the idea of density together with spatial distribution of data points in feature space. This new notion has a potential to separate various type of clusters. In summary, the approach presented here is non-convex admissive (i.e., convex hulls of the clusters found can intersect which is desirable for non-convex clusters), cluster proportion and omission admissive (i.e., duplicating a cluster arbitrary number of times or deleting a cluster does not alter other cluster’s boundaries), scale covariant, consistent (shrinking within cluster distances and enlarging inter-cluster distances does not affect the clustering results) but not rich (does not generates exhaustive partitions of the data) and density invariant. (2) Strategy for automatic detection of various tunable parameters in the proposed ‘Vicinity Based Cluster Detection’ (VBCD) algorithm is presented. (3) New internal evaluation index called ‘Space-Density Index’ (SDI) for the clustered results (by any method) is also presented. Experimental results reveal that VBCD captures the idea of ‘natural groupings’ better than the existing approaches.

There are various problem associates with this topic like low resolution of image, similarity of kidney stone and prediction of stone in the new image of kidney. Ultrasound images have low contrast and are difficult to detect and extract the region of interest. Therefore, the image has to go through the preprocessing which normally contains image enhancement. The aim behind this operation is to find the out the best quality, so that the identification becomes easier. Medical imaging is one of the fundamental imaging, because they are used in more sensitive field which is a medical field and it must be accurate. In this paper, we first proceed for the enhancement of the image with the help of median filter, Gaussian filter and un-sharp masking. After that we use morphological operations like erosion and dilation and then entropy based segmentation is used to find the region of interest and finally we use KNN and SVM classification techniques for the analysis of kidney stone images. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",and SVM; classification; Hog; KNN; morphological operation; region of interest,Biological organs; Classification (of information); Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Median filters; Medical imaging; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Ultrasonic applications; and SVM; Gaussian filters; Morphological operations; Nearest neighbour; Region of interest; Support vector machine classification techniques; SVM classification; Ultrasound images; Image segmentation,"Verma, J.; Department of ECE, Hindu College of Engineering Industrial AreaIndia; email: er.jyotiverma01@gmail.com",,Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing,10546618,,,,English,Pattern Recogn.

The hardware-based packet classification relies on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to meet this speed requirement. However, TCAM consumes huge power and also supports only for longest prefix match and exact match, where the classification rule also has a range match (RM) field. Hence, it is mandatory to encode the RM into prefix match to accommodate the rule in TCAM. In the worst case, one rule is encoded into (2W - 2)2 rules (where W is a number of bits to represent range). This work proposes a novel RM architecture, and a detailed analysis about the range field on the standard dataset and the real-life classifier rules are presented. In the literature, the existing RM architecture is used to avoid the range to prefix conversion, but due to the serial operation, it lacks in performance. For constant time lookup, TCAM is the best option, but it does not support RM. The proposed architecture takes one clock cycle for RM and does not require any encoding/conversion. Hence, there will be a single entry for every rule. It is observed that just 4% of the two-dimensional range rules are present in this dataset, and it will increase the rule set size by 4 times in the best case and nearly 30 times in the worst case. The proposed RM circuit is operated in parallel with TCAM without compromising the speed, and this circuit saves huge power around 70% and area around 61%, where the range to prefix conversion/encoding is completely avoided. The proposed architecture is well suited for current IPv4-and IPv6-based networks, as well as in software-defined networks in the near future. © 2017 ACM.",Packet classification; Range encoding; Range match; TCAM,Classification (of information); Encoding (symbols); Logic gates; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Signal encoding; Table lookup; Ternary content adressable memory; Longest prefix matches; Packet classification; Proposed architectures; Range encoding; Range match; Routing table lookup; TCAM; Ternary content addressable memory; Internet protocols,,,Association for Computing Machinery,10844309,,,,English,ACM Trans.

The parameters of the fuzzy layer of R-ELANFIS are randomly selected by incorporating the explicit knowledge representation using fuzzy membership functions. The parameters of the linear neural layer are determined by solving a constrained optimization problem in a regularized framework.

It serves as a source of second opinion that radiologists may consider in order to interpret CT images. In this work, the purpose of CAD is to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary bronchitis from CT images of the lung. Methods Left and right lung fields are segmented using optimal thresholding from the lung CT images. Texture and shape features are extracted from the pathology bearing regions. A hybrid feature selection approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) combining cosine similarity and support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to select relevant features. Additionally, tandem run recruitment strategy is included in the selection activity to choose the promising features. The SVM classifier is trained using the selected features and the performance of the trained classifier is evaluated using trivial performance evaluation measures. Results The training and testing datasets used in building the classifier model are disjoint and contains 200 CT slices affected with bronchitis, 50 normal slices and 300 slices with cancer. Out of 100 features extracted from each CT slice, a subset of 60 features is used for classification. ACO with tandem run strategy yielded 81.66% of accuracy whereas ACO without tandem run yielded an accuracy of 77.52%. When all the features are used for classifier training without feature selection algorithm, an accuracy of 75.14% is achieved. Conclusion From the results, it is inferred that identifying relevant features to train the classifier has a definite impact on the classifier performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ant colony optimization; Computer aided diagnosis; Hybrid approach; Pulmonary bronchitis; SVM classification; Tandem run recruitment,"Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Feature extraction; Support vector machines; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Feature selection algorithm; Hybrid approach; Hybrid feature selections; Pulmonary bronchitis; SVM classification; Tandem run recruitment; Computerized tomography; ant colony optimization; Article; bronchitis; classification algorithm; classifier; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; image segmentation; left lung; lung cancer; noise reduction; right lung; support vector machine; algorithm; bronchitis; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; lung; support vector machine; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Bronchitis; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Lung; Support Vector Machine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Nehemiah, H.K.; Ramanujan Computing Centre, Anna UniversityIndia",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28552117,English,Comput.

Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources.

In this paper, we present a new methodology for EEG-based automated diagnosis of epilepsy. Our method involves detection of key points at multiple scales in EEG signals using a pyramid of difference of Gaussian filtered signals. Local binary patterns (LBPs) are computed at these key points and the histogram of these patterns are considered as the feature set, which is fed to the support vector machine (SVM) for the classification of EEG signals. The proposed methodology has been investigated for the four well-known classification problems namely, 1) normal and epileptic seizure, 2) epileptic seizure and seizure free, 3) normal, epileptic seizure, and seizure free, and 4) epileptic seizure and nonseizure EEG signals using publically available university of Bonn EEG database. Our experimental results in terms of classification accuracies have been compared with existing methods for the classification of the aforementioned problems. Further, performance evaluation on another EEG dataset shows that our approach is effective for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals.

Reconstructed single photon emission computed tomography images are used to differentiate between subjects with normal value and abnormal value of ejection fraction. The method analyses pixel intensities that correspond to blood flow in the left ventricular region. The algorithm proceeds through three main stages: the initial stage does a pre-processing task to reduce noise as well as blur in the image. The second stage extracts features from the images. Classification is done in the final stage. The pre-processing stage consists of a de-noising part and a de-blurring part. Novel features are used for classification. Features are extracted as three different sets based on: the pixel intensity distribution in different regions, spatial relationship of pixels and multi-scale image information. Two supervised algorithms are proposed for classification: one algorithm is based on a threshold value computed from the features extracted from the training images and the other algorithm is based on sequential minimal optimization-based support vector machine approach. Experimental studies were performed on real cardiac SPECT images obtained from hospital. The result of classification has been verified by an expert nuclear medicine physician and by the ejection fraction value obtained from quantitative gated SPECT, the most widely used software package for quantifying gated SPECT images. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",Constrained least-square filtering; Ejection fraction; Nuclear medicine imaging; Single photon emission computed tomography imaging; Support vector machine,Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computerized tomography; Image classification; Image processing; Nuclear medicine; Optimization; Particle beams; Photons; Pixels; Support vector machines; Tomography; Constrained least squares; Ejection fraction; Nuclear medicine imaging; Pixel based approach; Sequential minimal optimization; Single photon emission computed tomography images; Spatial relationships; Supervised algorithm; Single photon emission computed tomography,"Sasi, N.M.; Model Engineering College, CUSATIndia; email: neethumsasi@gmail.com",,Springer London,18631703,,,,English,Signal Image Video Process.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007189909

Utilizing multiple data representations to improve the accuracy of classification has been explored in literature. However, approaches such as combining classifiers using majority voting and score level fusion do not utilize the underlying structure of the data which is available at the representation stage itself. In this paper, we propose a kernelization based extension to the group sparse representation classifier which can utilize multiple representations of input data to improve classification performance. By using a kernel, these representations are processed in a higher dimensional space where they are more separable, without substantially increasing computational costs. The proposed algorithm selects the ideal kernel to use along with its parameters automatically as part of the training process.

Existing LID systems which use low-level signal information for classification do not scale well due to exponential growth of parameters as the classes increase. They also suffer performance degradation due to the inherent variabilities of speech signal. In the proposed approach, we model the language-specific phonotactic information in speech using recurrent neural network for developing an LID system. The input speech signal is tokenized to phone sequences by using a common language-independent phone recognizer with varying phonetic coverage. We establish a causal relationship between phonetic coverage and LID performance. The phonotactics in the observed phone sequences are modeled using statistical and recurrent neural network language models to predict language-specific symbol from a universal phonetic inventory. Proposed approach is robust, computationally light weight and highly scalable. Experiments show that the convex combination of statistical and recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) based phonotactic models significantly outperform a strong baseline system of Deep Neural Network (DNN) which is shown to surpass the performance of i-vector based approach for LID. The proposed approach outperforms the baseline models in terms of mean F1 score over 176 languages.

This is achieved by properly selecting the centers and widths for the radial basis function (RBF) units of the hidden layer. For this purpose, firstly, a set of self-organizing map (SOM) networks are trained for center selection. For training a SOM network, random Gaussian noise is injected in the samples of each class of the data set. The number of SOM networks is same as the number of classes present in the data set, and each of the SOM networks is trained separately by the samples belonging to a particular class. The weight vector associated with a unit in the output layer of a particular SOM network corresponding to a class is used as the center of a RBF unit for that class. To determine the widths of the RBF units, p-nearest neighbor algorithm is used class-wise. Proper selection of centers and widths makes the RBFN robust with respect to input perturbation and outliers present in the data set. The weights between the hidden and output layers of RBFN are obtained by pseudo inverse method. To test the robustness of the proposed method in additive and multiplicative noise scenarios, ten standard data sets have been used for classification. Proposed method has been compared with three existing methods, where the centers have been generated in three ways: randomly, using k-means algorithm, and based on SOM network. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to those methods. Wilcoxon signed-rank test also shows that the proposed method is statistically better than those methods. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Additive noise; Gaussian noise; Multiplicative noise; Radial basis function network; Robustness; Self-organizing map,Additive noise; Classification (of information); Conformal mapping; Functions; Gaussian noise (electronic); Inverse problems; Phase noise; Robustness (control systems); Self organizing maps; Additive and multiplicative noise; Multiplicative noise; Nearest neighbor algorithm; Radial basis function Networks (RBFN); Radial Basis Function(RBF); Random Gaussian noise; Self-organizing map networks; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Radial basis function networks,"Dey, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NIT DurgapurIndia; email: pd.12cse1107@phd.nitdgp.ac.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

For learning, spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) may be implemented using an energy efficient waveform superposition on memristor based synapse. However, system level implementation has three challenges. First, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short voltage-spikes which is disturbed by large voltage-waveforms that are simultaneously applied on the same memristor for real-time learning i.e. the simultaneous read-write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly replicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware. Third, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this paper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the learning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in real-time, asynchronously - avoiding non-biomimetic clocking based complex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit-simulator) with MATLAB® (mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an example, the hardware shows 97.5% accuracy in classification which is equivalent to software for a Fisher's Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is implemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO2 memristor. We show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the hardware performance (85%), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM characteristics specifically for SNN. © 2017 IEEE.",Fischer Iris dataset; Iris classification; Memristors; RRAM; RRAM cross-point array; SPICE; Spiking neural network; Synaptic-time-dependent-plasticity,Biomimetics; Circuit simulation; Classification (of information); Computer software; Energy efficiency; Hafnium oxides; MATLAB; Memristors; Neural networks; RRAM; SPICE; Cross-point array; Fischer Iris dataset; Iris classifications; Spiking neural networks; Time dependent; Hardware,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,85OFA,,English,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031012273

RDDL is suitable for learning representations from signals corrupted with sparse but large outliers such as artifacts and noise that are more heavy tailed than Gaussian distributions. Such outliers are common in biomedical signals e.g. EEG and ECG. RDDL learns multiple levels of non-linear dictionaries for representing the data. Instead of the standard Euclidean cost function that is usually employed in dictionary learning, we propose a robust l1-norm cost function. In order to achieve sparse representation, an l1-norm is imposed on the learned representation. The 'depth' arises from the fact that multiple levels of dictionaries are learnt. The full formulation is solved in a greedy fashion, one layer at a time. To study the extent of usefulness of RDDL, we first benchmark it with two wellknown deep learning tools - the stacked denoising autoencoder and the deep belief network methods; experiments are carried out on benchmark deep learning datasets - MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. In all cases, our method yields the best results. Then the proposed method is used for learning representations of ECG data (containing arficacts) and for their classification using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia classification database.

In this paper, we propose to use Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) to carry out concept-based classification of software defect reports. We compute the 'semantic similarity' between the defect type labels and the defect report in a concept space spanned by Wikipedia articles and then, assign the defect type which has the highest similarity with the defect report.

The benefits provided by plants are manifold. Plant identification is challenging but it is extremely useful for making accurate decisions regarding livestock systems, conservation and ecology. Though most plants may look similar, they might not be the same. Hence, it becomes essential to develop a system which will identify plants by studying the uniqueness they exhibit at a granular level. Leaves serve as unique identifiers for plants. Hence, physical characteristics demonstrated by leaves act as fingerprints for their identification. This paper explores and proposes leaf identification method based on color, shape, structural and textural characteristics of leaves. These features are then subjected to three different well-Trained Neural Network architectures which categorically classify the leaves. A performance comparison is made between the architectures by assessing their test set classification accuracies on the leaf image database considered in this study. © 2016 IEEE.",deep belief networks; eigen transformation; morphological processing; shallow networks; structural decomposition,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Network architecture; Neural networks; Signal processing; Classification accuracy; Deep belief networks; eigen transformation; Morphological processing; Physical characteristics; Structural decomposition; Textural characteristic; Trained neural networks; Plants (botany),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the scalp surface using metal electrodes and conductive media[6], and inhibits lots of information to different emotional states and the recorded data is very complex. In the present work EEG signal is used to detect emotions at different situations. The real emotions are detected which acts as a real indicator described by the human subject. In this paper, the EEG signals are analyzed for feature extraction using 'db4' wavelet using multilevel decomposition. 10 real human subjects real EEG samples are collected using standard International 10-20 Electrode placement system which is placed over an entire scalp of human subject and it is decomposed into 5 different EEG bands using Discrete wavelet Transform (DWT). Emotion detection is the task of emotional state like recognizing a person's happiness, fear, anger, confusion or deceit across both voice and non voice channels. Emotion detection is based on a set of conventional features which are extracted like energy, Power spectral density, from the EEG signals for classifying emotions and to identify the intensity level of different bands of EEG signal. Feature extraction results are obtained by using 'Bior 5.5' and 'db4' wavelet for signal decomposition and to obtain the accurate frequency bands and feature Classification is performed by obtaining an accuracy of 75% for normal patient and 65% for abnormal patient. © 2016 IEEE.",Bior 5.5; Discrete wavelet transform; Electroencephalogram; Emotion detection; Feature extraction,Brain; Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Frequency bands; Power spectral density; Signal detection; Signal processing; Spectral density; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Bior 5.5; Electrical activities; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Emotion detection; Feature classification; Feature extraction and classification; Multilevel decomposition; Signal decomposition; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Our training dataset include fifty values and eight attributes. Then in next step in real time IDS again capture real time network packets calculate features from captured packets then load training dataset then apply artificial neural network algorithm which is work in three layers input layer, output layer and hidden layer and provides two outputs normal packets and flood packets.

It causes a blurred and foggy vision which can lead to partial or complete loss of eyesight. A protein layer is developed gradually and the lens becomes cloudy over a long period of time which reduces vision and leads to blindness. Early treatment can lessen the difficulties faced by cataract patients and avert visual impairment. People living in underdeveloped countries and rural areas cannot get effective treatment in time due to scarcity of eye care services and resources. Additionally, the existing methods for cataract diagnosis are sophisticated and expensive. Considering the above scenario, cutting down the cost and simplifying the process of cataract diagnosis is important.

Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of deep architectures for face recognition by training as classifiers on voluminous datasets. Some architectures are trained as classifiers, and some directly learn an embedding via a triplet loss function. In this paper, we consider the case of one shot prediction from the feature space learnt initially via classification, i.e. we consider the situation where we have a pre-trained model, but do not have access to the training data and are required to make predictions on novel faces with just one training image per identity. We utilize the one shot similarity metric in order to compute similarity scores and compare it with the state-of-the-art results on the Youtube videos face dataset (YTF). We demonstrate the effect of temporal context on frame wise face recognition, and use a probabilistic majority voting scheme over past frames to determine current frame identity.

This paper concentrates on determining the emotional state from speech signals. Various acoustic features such as energy, zero crossing rate(ZCR), fundamental frequency, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), etc are extracted for short term, overlapping frames derived from the speech signal. A feature vector for every utterance is then constructed by analyzing the global statistics (mean, median, etc) of the extracted features over all frames. To select a subset of useful features from the full candidate feature vector, sequential backward selection (SBS) method is used with k-fold cross validation. Detection of emotion in the samples is done by classifying their respective feature vectors into classes, using either a pre-trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. This approach is tested with two acted emotional databases-Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EmoDB), and BML Emotion Database (RED).

Recently a few works have explored applicability of machine learning techniques to this problem. However, the challenging task of accurately finding the position depends on prior efforts of fingerprinting. Another challenge is that, distance sensitivity of signal strength depends on proximity to the access point. Heterogeneity of devices adds new dimension to the challenge. Existing solutions mostly aim at fingerprinting under the set of conditions considered so that training and test data can be taken under similar experimental setup. In this paper, an ensemble of condition based classifiers are designed for indoor localization that handles device heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity and context heterogeneity (door and window open/close, presence/absence of other users in vicinity). We have created an indoor localization data set where data is collected in above mentioned dimensions. When the training and test data sets are taken under similar environmental conditions with same devices, the average classification accuracy ranges between 72.2% to 92.6%. But for a validation set which contains examples for every conditions, the classifiers achieve an average maximum accuracy of 74.8% when individual training set corresponding to specific conditions are used. To avoid these conditional dependencies we have used an ensemble of condition specific K-nearest neighbour classifiers which enables us to predict the location with 96% accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.",Ensemble classifier; Indoor localization; Machine learning; RSSI; Wi-Fi,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Education; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Nearest neighbor search; Wi-Fi; Classification accuracy; Ensemble classifiers; Environmental conditions; Indoor localization; Machine learning techniques; Radio frequency fingerprinting; RSSI; Temporal heterogeneities; Indoor positioning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

One can perform the task of distinguishing the activities using classic classification techniques with two different data representations namely, statistical features and ECDF-based features. Our recommendation in this paper is to use the latter as it suits better for mobility activities. Our major contribution is to explore the challenge of class imbalance in detecting mobility activities. To handle that challenge, we propose use of an ensemble of a classification model. It improves accuracy of detection over standalone classification models. To evaluate performance of the recommended technique, we use transportation by a metro train as a running case study. We consider two activities during the metro train travel. They are (a) whether user is at a metro train station or (b) in a metro train. Our recommended technique results in precision of 98% for the case study. It is significantly more than the state-of-the-art value of 70% for a similar case study.

They are exceptionally afar from the capability of commonly used software tools and also beyond the handling possibility of the single machine architecture. Facing this challenge has activated a requisite to reexamine the data management options. The new avenues of NoSQL Big Data compared to the traditional forms has insisted on adapting experimental beds, helping to discover large unknown values from enormous data sets. Also, outmoded management systems and statistical packages express trouble handling Big Data. In numerous real applications, handling of imbalanced data sets is the fact of precedence. The classification of data sets having imbalanced class distribution has produced a notable drawback in performance obtained by the most standard classifier learning algorithms. Assuming balanced class distribution and equal misclassification costs lead to poor results. In a real-world domain, the classification methods of multi-class imbalance problem need more attention compared to the two-class problem. A methodology is presented for binary/multi-class imbalanced data sets with improved over-sampling (O. S.) techniques to enhance classification. The methods are broadly classified into two categories: non-clustered and cluster based advanced approach compared to prior work on O. S. techniques. The balanced data are subsequently analyzed for classification using various classifiers.

Due to lack of information about the modulation scheme used it cannot distinguish between signal present is that of the primary or any other secondary user communication. In this paper a multiclass modulation classification hierarchical framework is proposed which exploit cyclostationary features. The hierarchical framework uses two known binary classifiers SVM and Decision tree at each level which is based on one-Against-All approach. The proposed system assumes no a priori knowledge about signal properties like frequency, phase or symbol rate. The performance of the classifiers is compared based upon the accuracy, training time and classification time needed for each stage of the framework. It is demonstrated through simulation for four modulation types with the optimal features required for classifying each scheme in the proposed hierarchical framework.Compared with two existing methods the proposed framework is found to be effective for modulation detection of signals. © 2016 IEEE.",Cognitive radio; Cyclostationary features; Multi class classification,Binary trees; Classification (of information); Cognitive radio; Decision trees; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Image segmentation; Network function virtualization; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Transportation; Cyclostationary; Hierarchical modulation; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Modulation classification; Modulation detection; Multi-class classification; One-against-all approach; Signal classification; Modulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This results in opinion mining being one of the core areas of affective computing. Classification of opinions or sentiments is the core task in opinion mining. To accomplish this task, often Bag-Of-Words(BOW) is used as a feature for training a classifier in statistical machine learning. However, the fundamental limitations in handling the polarity shift problem in turn limits the performance of BOW in some cases. Also the external dictionaries used for generating training sets for opinion classification are not domain specific. This further limits the task of deriving the accurate sentiment or consumer opinion in certain cases. We address these two problems in opinion classification. To handle the problem of polarity shift, we propose a Dual Opinion mining Model. The data expansion technique used in this model creates a review which has opposite opinion as that of the original test review for each training and test review. Based on this we propose a dual training algorithm which uses the pairs of the original and the reversed review to learn an opinion classifier. A dual prediction algorithm is used for classification of test reviews by considering both positive and negative sides of each review. At the end we build a pseudo-opposites dictionary using a corpus based method. By this we tackle the problem of having to depend upon an external opposites dictionary for opposites of reviews. By doing this we also get a domain adaptive dictionary for training a classifier which increases the accuracy of the dual opinion mining model. © 2016 IEEE.",Natural language processing; Opinion classification; Opinion mining; Polarity shift problem,Data mining; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Affective Computing; Corpus-based methods; Fundamental limitations; Opinion mining; Polarity shift problem; Prediction algorithms; Statistical machine learning; Training algorithms; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In this paper, facial expression recognition using Efficient Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for feature extraction and artificial neural network (ANN) for classification is presented. Facial feature vectors are obtained using Efficient LBP algorithm by considering the blocks of four varied sizes (256 x 256, 128 x 128, 64 x 64 and 32 x 32) of the image dataset. The multiclass classification of the image dataset into the six basic universal emotions is carried out using ANN.

The free parameter of the network, spread constant is optimized to reduce the mean square error and thus the efficiency of recognition is improved as seen from the experimental results.

There is stiff competition among various companies and every company wants to have its clients happy and satisfied with the resolution of the problems. For this purpose, Agent Quality Monitoring is an important requirement. Since in a typical Call Centre, thousands of calls are made by agents in a single day, it is not possible to manually identify problematic calls by monitoring each and every agentclient conversation. Moreover, sometimes, individual monitoring is biased. What is non problematic for one can be problematic for another individual. Moreover, it is almost impossible to manually identify problematic calls in a language one doesn't know. Without a suitable technical approach, it is difficult to identify problematic calls without translating the call contents into our language, which often leads to security and privacy concerns for a private company. In this paper a sample of calls was taken and a proper technical approach is used to analyze the calls. The design of the proposed system is language independent. In this project, we make use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on 4 robust audio features, namely Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Energy, Volume and Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR). The support vectors are obtained by training the sample data set. The SVM Classifier is based on a simple algorithm which solves the two class problem and classifies the calls as problematic or non-problematic.

Automated classification of advertisement videos from the general program videos is emerging as an essential task that is expected to support the television (TV) viewers to have a seamless visual experience without being hampered by commercial advertisement videos (ADD). The demand for a solution is gaining momentum which will enable the viewers to skip the advertisements and move automatically to another channel. This can be achieved just by classifying the extracted frames of videos of advertisements and non-Advertisements videos (NADD) which consist of more visual information. In this present work, the descriptive feature is derived through the block intensity comparison technique and applied on 8x8 block size of the frames. The best performing features are identified and selected by decision tree (J48) algorithm and these selected features are used for classification by the Ripple Down Rule Learner (RIDOR) algorithm.

A number of works have been reported over the years to accurately detect the vowel regions and the corresponding vowel onset points (VOPs) and vowel end points (VEPs). Effectiveness of the statistical acoustic modeling techniques and the front-end signal processing approaches has been explored in this regard. The work presented in this paper aims at improving the detection of vowel regions as well as the VOPs and VEPs. A number of statistical modeling approaches developed over the years have been employed in this work for the aforementioned task. To do the same, three-class classifiers (vowel, nonvowel and silence) are developed on the TIMIT database employing the different acoustic modeling techniques and the classification performances are studied. Using any particular three-class classifier, a given speech sample is then forced-aligned against the trained acoustic model under the constraints of first-pass transcription to detect the vowel regions. The correctly detected and spurious vowel regions are analyzed in detail to find the impact of semivowel and nasal sound units on the detection of vowel regions as well as on the determination of VOPs and VEPs. In addition to that, a novel front-end feature extraction technique exploiting the temporal and spectral characteristics of the excitation source information in the speech signal is also proposed. The use of the proposed excitation source feature results in the detection of vowel regions that are quite different from those obtained through the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Exploiting those differences in the obtained evidences by using the two kinds of features, a technique to combine the evidences is also proposed in order to get a better estimate of the VOPs and VEPs. When the proposed techniques are evaluated on the vowel–nonvowel classification systems developed using the TIMIT database, significant improvements are noted. Moreover, the improvements are noted to hold across all the acoustic modeling paradigms explored in the presented work. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",DNN; Phone recognition system; SGMM; Vowel end point; Vowel onset point,Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Linguistics; Point contacts; Signal processing; Speech; Speech communication; Classification performance; End points; Excitation source information; Feature extraction techniques; Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient; Phone recognition; SGMM; Vowel onset point; Speech recognition,"Pradhan, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: gdp@nitp.ac.in",,Birkhauser Boston,0278081X,,CSSPE,,English,Circ Syst Signal Process,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016564269

Therefore, this paper proposes a rule extraction algorithm from neural network using classified and misclassified data to convert the black box nature of Artificial Neural Network into a white box. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the existing algorithm, Rule Extraction by Reverse Engineering (RxREN). The proposed algorithm extracts rules from trained neural network for datasets with mixed mode attributes using pedagogical approach.

The classification modules are designed using preprocessing, feature extraction and tumor detection techniques using Co-Active Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) classifier. The image enhancement can be achieved using Heuristic histogram equalization technique as preprocessing and further texture features as Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) features and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are extracted from the enhanced image. These features are used to classify the brain image into normal and abnormal using CANFIS classifier. The tumor region in abnormal brain image is segmented using normalized graph cut segmentation algorithm. The retrieval module is used to retrieve the similar segmented tumor regions from the dataset for diagnosing the tumor region using Euclidean algorithm. The proposed Glioma Brain tumor classification methodology achieves 97.28% sensitivity, 98.16% specificity and 99.14% accuracy.

This interaction is an attribute of natural speech and is rarely present in synthetic or voice-converted speech. Therefore, we propose features based on the S-F interaction for a spoofed speech detection (SSD) task. To that effect, we estimate the voice excitation source (i.e., differenced glottal flow waveform, g?(t)) and model it using the well-known Liljencrants-Fant model to get coarse structure, gc (t). The residue or difference, gr (t), between g?(t) and gc (t) is known to capture the nonlinear S-F interaction. In the time domain, the L2 norm of gr (t) in the closed, open, and return phases of the glottis are considered as features. In the frequency domain, the Mel representation of gr (t) showed significant contribution in the SSD task. The proposed features are evaluated on the first ASVspoof 2015 challenge database using a Gaussian mixture model based classification system. On the evaluation set, for vocoder-based spoofs (i.e., S1-S9), the score-level fusion of residual energy features, Mel representation of the residual signal, and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features gave an equal error rate (EER) of 0.017%, which is much less than the 0.319% obtained with MFCC alone. Furthermore, the residues of the spectrogram( aswell as theMel-warped spectrogram) of estimated g?(t) and gc (t) are also explored as features for the SSD task. The features are evaluated for robustness in the presence of additive white, babble, and car noise at various signal-to-noise-ratio levels on the ASVspoof 2015 database and for channel mismatch condition on the Blizzard Challenge 2012 dataset. For both cases, the proposed features gave significantly less EER than that obtained by MFCC on the evaluation set. © 2017 IEEE.",Anti-spoofing; Gaussian mixture model; LFmodel; Residue; Source-filter interaction,Bandpass filters; Classification (of information); Gaussian distribution; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrographs; Speech; Storms; Anti-spoofing; Gaussian Mixture Model; LF model; Residue; Source filters; Speech recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,19324553,,,,English,IEEE J.

Feature subset selection for microarray data aims at reducing the number of genes so that useful information can be extracted from the samples. Reducing the dimension of data sets further helps in improving the computational efficiency of the learning model. In this paper, we propose a modified algorithm based on the tabu search as local search procedures to a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) for high dimensional microarray data sets. The proposed Tabu based Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure algorithm is named as TGRASP. In TGRASP, a new parameter has been introduced named as Tabu Tenure and the existing parameters, NumIter and size have been modified. We observed that different parameter settings affect the quality of the optimum. The second proposed algorithm known as FFGRASP (Firefly Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) uses a firefly optimization algorithm in the local search optimization phase of the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Firefly algorithm is one of the powerful algorithms for optimization of multimodal applications. Experimental results show that the proposed TGRASP and FFGRASP algorithms are much better than existing algorithm with respect to three performance parameters viz. accuracy, run time, number of a selected subset of features. We have also compared both the approaches with a unified metric (Extended Adjusted Ratio of Ratios) which has shown that TGRASP approach outperforms existing approach for six out of nine cancer microarray datasets and FF- GRASP performs better on seven out of nine datasets.",Classification; Feature selection; Firefly algorithm; GRASP; Hill climbing; Microarray; Tabu search,Bioluminescence; Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Data mining; Diseases; Feature extraction; Genes; Heuristic algorithms; Local search (optimization); Microarrays; Tabu search; Feature subset selection; Firefly algorithms; GRASP; Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure; Hill climbing; Hybrid feature selections; Multimodal application; Optimization algorithms; Optimization,,,University of Zagreb,13301136,,,,English,J.

The proposed feature is evaluated using mutual information (MI) on the difference and ratio values of the Fourier parameters, amplitude and frequency. The difference and ratio are calculated between two contiguous values of the Fourier parameters. To analyze the out-of-breath speech, a new stressed speech database, named out-of-breath speech (OBS) database, is created. The database contains three classes of speech, out-of-breath speech, low out-of-breath speech and normal speech. The effectiveness of the proposed features is evaluated with the statistical analysis. The proposed features not only differentiate the normal speech and the out-of-breath speech, but also can discriminate different breath emission levels of speech. Hidden Markov model (HMM) and support vector machine (SVM) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed features using the OBS database. For multi-class classification problem, SVM classifier is used with binary cascade approach. The performance of the proposed features is compared with the breathiness feature, the mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature and the Teager energy operator (TEO) based critical band TEO autocorrelation envelope (TEO-CB-Auto-Env) feature.

Generalization capability of the model is enhanced with a fast and improved learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM). The model explores the features of an input pattern to the possible extent in order to acquire improved class discriminatory information for data sets with ill-defined and overlapping class boundaries. This is obtained through feature-wise degree of belonging of patterns to different classes. Two ways of feature exploration; one using fuzzy set theory to deal with the impreciseness, and other using neighborhood rough set (NRS) theory to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness in the data sets, makes the classification model more efficient. A fuzzification matrix is finally developed with these features, whose elements are fed as input to the neural network. The resultant model thus takes the advantages of fuzzy sets, NRS and ELM algorithm mutually, which is highly suitable for the classification of data sets with overlapping class boundaries. Superiority of the proposed model to other similar methods is established qualitatively and quantitatively using both completely labeled data sets and partially labeled remote sensing images. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Extreme learning machine; Fuzzy sets; Hybridization; Neighborhood rough sets; Neural networks; Pattern recognition,Algorithms; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Image reconstruction; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Remote sensing; Rough set theory; Set theory; Classification models; Classification of data; Extreme learning machine; Generalization capability; Hybridization; Neighborhood rough sets; Neuro-fuzzy network; Remote sensing images; Classification (of information),"Meher, S.K.; Systems Science and Informatics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 8th Mile, Mysore Road, India; email: saroj.meher@isibang.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953388682

In MCC, mobile users access the cloud services with the mobile device. Generally, the users of mobile cloud can select their services from the broker using an agent. There is an agreement between the users and service provider called SLA. Data are of varying types and they require different security levels based on their requirement. Classification of Mobile user’s data is a time-consuming process. A superior naive classifier for secure data classification in agent based mobile cloud computing is proposed in this paper. The agent classifies the user’s data into three different groups namely, low, medium, high. Then, the data are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standards (AES). Encrypted data is transferred to the broker for selecting for suitable service agent.But the broker has many to one relationship with service agents. Then the data is sent to the cloud service provider for storage. The stored data is then homomorphically encrypted which enables the cloud provider and cloud user to process the data without the need for decryption. Performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed method reduces classification time and provides better security and integrity on mobile cloud data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Advanced encryption standards; Homomorphic encryption; Mobile cloud computing; Superior naive classifier; Ubiquitous computing,Big data; Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Embedded systems; Mobile devices; Ubiquitous computing; Advanced Encryption Standard; Classification time; Cloud service providers; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Mobile users access; Naive classifiers; Performance analysis; Service provider; Mobile cloud computing,"Arvind, K.S.; Anna UniversityIndia; email: erodearvind@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014245407

Analyzing all these databases is one of the difficult tasks in the medical environment. In order to warehouse all these databases and to analyze the patient's condition, we need an efficient data mining technique. In this paper, an efficient data mining technique for warehousing clinical databases using Rough Set Theory (RST) and Fuzzy Logic is proposed. Our proposed methodology contains two phases - (i) Clustering and (ii) Classification. In the first phase, Rough Set Theory is used for clustering. Clustering is one of the data mining techniques for warehousing the heterogeneous data bases. Clustering technique is used to group data that have similar characteristics in the same cluster and also to group the data that have dissimilar characteristics with other clusters. After clustering the data, similar objects will be clustered in one cluster and the dissimilar objects will be clustered under another cluster. The RST can be reduced the complexity. Then in the second phase, these clusters are classified using Fuzzy Logic. Normally, Classification with Fuzzy Logic is generated more number of rules. Since the RST is utilized in our work, the classification using Fuzzy can be done with less amount of complexity. The proposed approach is evaluated using various clinical related databases from heart disease datasets - Cleveland, Switzerland and Hungarian. The performance analysis is based on Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy with different cluster numbers. The experimentation results show that our proposed methodology provides better accuracy result. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",classification; clustering; Data mining; fuzzy logic; rough set theory; warehousing,Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Data mining; Database systems; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Medical computing; Set theory; Warehouses; clustering; Clustering techniques; Heterogeneous data; Large amounts of data; Medical conditions; Performance analysis; Rough set theory (RST); warehousing; Rough set theory,,,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Analysis of the gene expression data reveals that not all but few important genes are responsible for the diseases. However, the DNA microarray data set usually contain multiple missing value and therefore, selection of important genes using the incomplete data set may be erroneous, resulting misclassification in disease prediction. In the paper we propose an integrated framework, which first imputes the missing value and then in order to achieve maximum accuracy in classifying the patients a classifier has been designed to select the genes using the complete microarray data set. Here functionally similar genes are employed to estimate the missing value unlike the existing gene expression value based distance similarity measure. However, the functionally similar genes may differ in their protein production capacity and so the degree of similarity between the genes varies from gene to gene. The problem has been dealt by proposing a novel method to impute the missing value using the concept of fuzzy similarity. After imputing the missing value, the continuous gene expression matrix is discretized using fuzzy sets to distinguish the activation levels of different genes. The proposed fuzzy importance factor (FIf) of each gene represents its activation level or protein production capacity both in the disease and normal class. The importance of each gene is evaluated while optimizing the number of rules in the fuzzy classifier depending on the FIf. The methodology we propose has been demonstrated using nine different cancer data sets and compared with the state of the art methods.

Granger causality is employed to assign preferences to each criteria. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to obtain weights for different features from the two criteria and their preferences. Finally, these weights are used to build a weighted distance function for the kNN classification.

To accurately identify the QRS locations from the acquired raw ECG signals, we need to handle a number of challenges, which include noise, baseline wander, varying peak amplitudes, and signal abnormality. This research aims to address these challenges by developing an efficient lightweight algorithm for QRS (i.e., R-peak) detection from raw ECG signals. Methods A lightweight real-time sliding window-based Max-Min Difference (MMD) algorithm for QRS detection from Lead II ECG signals is proposed. Targeting to achieve the best trade-off between computational efficiency and detection accuracy, the proposed algorithm consists of five key steps for QRS detection, namely, baseline correction, MMD curve generation, dynamic threshold computation, R-peak detection, and error correction. Five annotated databases from Physionet are used for evaluating the proposed algorithm in R-peak detection. Integrated with a feature extraction technique and a neural network classifier, the proposed ORS detection algorithm has also been extended to undertake normal and abnormal heartbeat detection from ECG signals. Results The proposed algorithm exhibits a high degree of robustness in QRS detection and achieves an average sensitivity of 99.62% and an average positive predictivity of 99.67%. Its performance compares favorably with those from the existing state-of-the-art models reported in the literature. In regards to normal and abnormal heartbeat detection, the proposed QRS detection algorithm in combination with the feature extraction technique and neural network classifier achieves an overall accuracy rate of 93.44% based on an empirical evaluation using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia data set with 10-fold cross validation. Conclusions In comparison with other related studies, the proposed algorithm offers a lightweight adaptive alternative for R-peak detection with good computational efficiency. The empirical results indicate that it not only yields a high accuracy rate in QRS detection, but also exhibits efficient computational complexity at the order of O(n), where n is the length of an ECG signal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",ECG analysis; Feature extraction; Max-min difference algorithm; QRS or R-peak detection,"Biomedical signal processing; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Electrocardiography; Error correction; Extraction; Feature extraction; Signal detection; 10-fold cross-validation; Difference algorithms; ECG analysis; Empirical evaluations; Feature extraction techniques; Neural network classifier; QRS detection algorithms; R-peak detection; Computational efficiency; algorithm; Article; calculation; classifier; electrocardiography; false positive result; heart beat; mathematical analysis; QRS complex; artificial neural network; heart arrhythmia; heart rate; human; signal processing; Algorithms; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Zhang, L.; Computational Intelligence Research Group, Department of Computing Science and Digital Technologies, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria, Newcastle, United Kingdom",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28495007,English,Comput.

The internet provides many opportunities for companies to provide personalized online services to their customers, but the quality and novelty of some web services may adversely affect the appeal and user gratification. In the future, prediction of the consumer intention needs to be a main focus for selecting the web services for an application. The aim of this study is to predict online consumer repurchase intentions; to accomplish this objective a hybrid approach is chosen with a combination of machine learning techniques and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm being used. The study starts with identification of consumer characteristics for repurchase intention, followed by determining the feature selection of consumer characteristics and shopping mall attributes (with >0.1 threshold value) for the prediction model using ABC. Finally, validation using k-fold cross has been employed to measure the best classification model robustness. The classification models, viz. decision trees (C5.0), AdaBoost, random forest, support vector machine and neural network, are utilized to predict consumer purchase intention. Performance evaluation of identified models on training–testing partitions (70–30%) of the data set shows that the AdaBoost method outperforms other classification models, with sensitivity and accuracy of 0.95 and 97.58%, respectively, on testing the data set. Examining the consumer repurchase intentions by considering both shopping mall and consumer characteristics makes this study unique. © 2017 The Natural Computing Applications Forum",Artificial bee colony algorithm; Classification; Consumer; k-Fold cross-validation; Prediction; Sensitivity,Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; E-learning; Electronic commerce; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Learning systems; Online systems; Optimization; Purchasing; Shopping centers; Statistical tests; Web services; Websites; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Classification models; Consumer; K fold cross validations; Machine learning techniques; Repurchase intention; Sensitivity; Learning algorithms,"Kumar, A.; School of Management, BML Munjal UniversityIndia; email: anil.kumar@bml.edu.in",,Springer London,9410643,,,,English,Neural Comput.

The paper exemplifies the creation of a knowledge-centric environment for a non-profit sector such as a higher education. Building knowledge and thereafter using it are important aspects of knowledge-centric environment; this further helps the organization to gain competitive advantage. With the increase in popularity of genetic algorithm (GA), the technique has been used in building efficient classifiers for creating effective rule sets. The paper makes use of multi-objective genetic algorithm for building GA-based efficient classifier because classification rule mining is itself, a multi-objective problem. Knowledge expressed through classification rules help in establishing relationships between attributes that are not visible openly. The study assumes importance as curriculum planning is an important aspect of any academic institution, the knowledge derived in the form of rules residing in the knowledge base help to substantiate proper curriculum development, making a sizeable contribution toward professional growth and advancement of the students.

Density difference between features for paired classes is used for assigning weights to the features. Existing methods select only those features that can distinguish between all classes at the same time. A new filter based feature selection method termed as Paired Class Density Difference with Inconsistency (PCDDI) is proposed in this paper. It can be used for a multi-class problem. This approach selects those features that distinguish between few classes but still play an important role in classification. Inconsistency measure is used in order to remove redundancy in the selected feature set. Classification accuracy of the proposed method is compared with that obtained using existing filter based feature selection methods on UCI machine learning repository datasets and on manual segmentation data provided by NIST. Increased classification accuracy for PCDDI shows that the concept of using density difference to assign feature weight is a significant contribution. © 2016 IEEE.,density function; Feature Selection; Filter approach; Inconsistency measure.,Feature extraction; Learning systems; Probability density function; Classification accuracy; Feature selection algorithm; Feature selection methods; Filter approach; Inconsistency measures; Multi-class problems; Robust feature selection; UCI machine learning repository; Classification (of information),"Chandra, B.; Sprinklr and Adjunct IITIndia; email: bchandra104@yahoo.co.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

DAC-MSS builds a multi-category classifier model organized in the form of a tree of binary classifiers. The tree consists of several TW-LKSC classifiers which use a training set consisting of few labeled samples and rest unlabeled samples to generate a pair of hyperplanes, by solving a system of linear equations. The propagation of labels to unlabeled patterns is achieved through localized kernel spectral clustering (LKSC) which is the core clustering model embedded in TW-LKSC. TW-LKSC also employs cluster prototype to localize the generation of hyperplanes and prevents them from extending infinitely. The strength of DAC-MSS is its better classification accuracy and improved learning time, due to divide and conquer approach, as compared to one-against-all based semi-supervised classification algorithms.

The statistical classifiers used in these data fusion approaches are also transformed by integrating the contextual information from neighboring pixels, to improve the accuracy of a fuzzy-logic-based fusion scheme. A decision level fusion approach was developed by Gokaraju et. al, 2012, which combines statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Here, each data sample is integrated through separate classifiers such as empirical methods and support vector machines (SVMs) and then used a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to fuse the decisions for a unified consensus decision. The data fusion approach consists of either pixel-level or feature-level data fusion in combination with machine learning techniques for classification. The intermediate results of the disaster management studies, such as levee land-slide and tornado debris assessment using data fusion techniques, are presented in this paper. For levee landslide studies, we used the multi-temporal datasets of air-borne synthetic aperture radar sensor (UAVSAR). For Tornado disaster studies, we used multi-source and multi-temporal datasets of both synthetic aperture radar sensor (RADARSAT-2) and multispectral sensor (RapiEye) datasets. The results of data fusion approach outperformed the non-data fusion techniques in both studies with kappa accuracies of 82.8% and 72%. © 2017 IEEE.",Data fusion; Disaster management; Machine learning; Remote sensing; SAR datasets,Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Data fusion; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Embankments; Fuzzy logic; Landslides; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Levees; Neural networks; Pixels; Radar; Radar equipment; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Tornadoes; Contextual information; Disaster management; Machine learning techniques; Multispectral sensors; Probabilistic neural networks; SAR datasets; Statistical classifier; Support vector machine (SVMs); Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,7347502,9.78154E+12,CPISD,,English,Conf Proc IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019680730

There is a need to analyze huge volumes of EEG data for finding the epileptic seizures. The manual analysis of EEG records for identifying seizure manifestations is time-consuming and creates an immense workload for the physician. To reduce the EEG analysis time, an autonomous epilepsy detection system is proposed using a Time-Frequency(TF) entropy measure. First, the TF spectrum of the EEG signal is computed using the S-Transform(ST). Then the entropy measure is determined from the TF spectrum. The performance metrics of the proposed entropy index is measured using a least square support vector machine(LSSVM) classifier. The proposed entropy feature produced a highest classification accuracy of 86% when validated with Bern-Barcelona EEG dataset. The area under curve(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) plot for the proposed entropy feature is 0.914. The average computational time for extracting the proposed entropy feature is 0.4027s.

A dataset is said to be imbalanced, if the representation of attribute categories are not approximately even. All the existing classifiers are inclined to perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. Hence it is very essential to go for well balanced dataset for classification. In this paper, the comprehensive Enhanced Minority Oversampling TEchnique (EMOTE) is proposed to balance the dataset.

The work aimed at implementing and classifying the intended controls for autonomous navigation, by analyzing the recorded EEG signals. Here, eye closures extracted from the EEG signals were pulse coded to generate the control signals for navigation. The EEG data was acquired using wireless Emotive Epoc EEG headset, with 14 electrodes, from ten healthy subjects. Preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance the signal, by removing noise and baseline variations. The features from the blinks considered were height of the ocular pulses and their respective widths, from four channels. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Artificial Neural Network Classifier were applied to classify the number of blinks. The results of the study showed that, for the data set under consideration, ANN Classifier gave 98.58% accuracy and 94% sensitivity, compared to KNN Classifier, which gave 96.06 % accuracy and 87.42% sensitivity, to classify the blinks for the control application. © 2016 IEEE.",accuracy; Artificial Neural Network Classifier; auto navigation; brain computer interfaces; control; EEG; eye blink; feature extraction; KNN; montage; performance analysis; sensitivity; specificity,Artificial intelligence; Brain computer interface; Classification (of information); Control; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Interfaces (computer); Navigation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Robots; Sensitivity analysis; accuracy; Artificial neural network classifiers; Auto-navigation; Eye blink; montage; Performance analysis; sensitivity; specificity; Biomedical signal processing,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The analysis and classification of the obtained data at the time of disaster is essential for conveying the information to the appropriate rescue personnel. In this paper, an automated text classification system is proposed in order to classify the data effectively. The classification of the tweets related to disaster is a challenging task as the texts are not correctly written or do not convey the exact meaning since people send the text messages in panic situations. A manual vocabulary has been created by considering the nature of the disaster data. The created vocabulary is used for splitting the tweets into various categories. In the categorized data, popular statistical feature selection methods like, term frequency, Chi Square are used in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes algorithms to classify the data. The results reveal that SVM performs better than Multinomial and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes for all the classes of disaster related data. © 2016 IEEE.",Disaster management; Multi-class Classification; Naïve Bayes; Support Vector Machine; Text Classification,Artificial intelligence; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Learning systems; Sodium; Support vector machines; Text processing; Bayes algorithms; Disaster management; Empirical analysis; Multi-class classification; Statistical features; Term Frequency; Text classification; Text classification systems; Classification (of information),,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

They are non-rigid objects and they appear in different orientations when they are imaged. To find out the genetic defects, the chromosomes are pre-processed so that they are not touching, overlapping, and bent, and the noise is also discarded. The presence of bends, overlaps, or touches makes it difficult to uncover the genetic abnormalities. So there is a need for development of an efficient technique to classify the segmented chromosomes into different types and then pre-process them in order to correct their orientation. In this work, a hybrid classification technique based upon correlation-based feature selection and classification via regression approach, which will classify the segmented chromosomes into five categories viz; straight, overlapping, bent, touching, or noise is presented. The performance evaluation has been done using 1592 segmented chromosomes from Advance Digital Imaging Research data set. The over-all accuracy of 94.78 % has been obtained for the five class problem. The performance of the proposed classifier has been compared with Bayes Net, Naïve Bayes, Radial Bias Feed Forward Network, and k-nearest-neighbour classifiers. Based upon this categorization, different pre-processing techniques will be applied to correct the orientation of the chromosomes. © 2016, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",Chromosomes; Classification; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Genetic defects,Chromosomes; Defects; Feature extraction; Genes; Nearest neighbor search; Feature selection and classification; Feed-forward network; Genetic abnormality; Genetic defects; Genetic information; Hybrid classification; K-nearest neighbours; Non-rigid objects; Classification (of information); Article; Bayes theorem; bent chromosome; chromosome; chromosome structure; classification; classifier; comparative study; controlled study; genetic disorder; geometry; human; k nearest neighbor; metaphase chromosome; noise; overlapping chromosome; priority journal; radial bias feed forward network; segmented chromosome; straight chromosome; touching chromosome,"Arora, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr. B.R Ambedkar National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: tanviverma@rediffmail.com",,Springer Verlag,1400118,,MBECD,,English,Med.

Various algorithms like K Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and C4.5 have been implemented to develop a classification model. The ultimate goal of a classifier is to accurately predict the target class for a given set of input data. The process of classification begins with the creation of a model by taking into consideration an input as a training dataset. MapReduce is a programming model developed to process large datasets on distributed clusters of commodity machines. This paradigm can be used to implement a classifier.

Visual Perception is considered as the end product of visual system. It can be described as the way the brain interprets what the eye sees. Human Visual System can easily extract the structure information and structure character is widely used in perception-oriented image processing tasks, such as image retrieval, face detection, texture classification, and quality assessment. The existing structure descriptor describes about the intensity character and luminance contrast of a local region. By the orientation selectivity mechanism, the correlations among pixels in a local region based on the similarities of their preferred orientation are computed. On imitating the arrangement of the excitatory/inhibitory cells, the correlations between the central pixel and its neighbors i.e local neighbors got binarized, and the orientation selectivity based pattern is used. Then, taking both the gradient magnitude and the orientation selectivity based pattern into account, a rotation invariant structure descriptor is introduced. According to the Orientation selectivity mechanism on primary visual cortex,a novel structure descriptor is introduced which represents the spatial correlation of an image which is applied in texture classification and image quality assessment. With the novel structure descriptor, image structure was extracted,an orientation selectivity based structural histogram and recognition of an image was derived to represent the image content. © 2016 IEEE.",Correlations; Human Visual System; Luminance; Perception Oriented,Classification (of information); Face recognition; Image analysis; Image processing; Image quality; Image retrieval; Integrated circuits; Luminance; Pixels; Search engines; Vision; Correlations; Human Visual System; Image quality assessment; Orientation selectivity; Preferred orientations; Primary visual cortex; Structure information; Texture classification; Image texture,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Extracting this information to guide decision making in a national security perspective remains a challenging task. The major issue arises due to a large amount of irrelevant information or complexity of unstructured data which makes information extraction and classification a very tedious task while analyzing the textual content for finding various aspects of entities or groups. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards introducing a context-based information extraction using National Security Information Sources (NSIS) which employs different types of knowledge inspired by natural activities of living things. In order to improve classification performance by utilizing relevant information from the sources related to national security and to make better decision, we assume that entities and relationships from these sources can be used to contextualize information from the records. This paper presents a new method for nature-inspired classification after extracting various features from dataset created using social posts and records. Then, analysis of classes of information to concepts available on knowledge sources is carried out to ensure quality of information based on the user needs. The simulation results demonstrated the ability of the proposed method inspired by cultural algorithm to extract group-centric information and improve classification performance using proposed Social Info Finder (SIF). This paper highlights the challenges and application of proposed SIF method to improve information extraction and performance of text classification focusing on national security and related threats. © 2016 IEEE.",Big data; Information extraction; National security; Nature-inspired computing; Social problems,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Decision making; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Integrated circuits; National security; Text processing; Amount of information; Classification performance; Context-based information; Information sources; Nature inspired computing; Quality of information; Social problems; Web-based environment; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Any intrusion detection model developed has to provide maximum accuracy with minimal false alarms. Identifying the optimal feature subset for classification is an important task for improved classification. In this paper, consistency based feature selection is used to identify the optimal feature subset. The usage of training data improves the ability to differentiate the classes with similar behavior hence supervised classifiers are deployed to produce more reliable and accurate results. In this paper, we build a hybrid model for intrusion detection integrating consistency based feature selection and ensemble of classifiers such as SVM and LPBoost. The objective of this paper is to determine the relevant features for the construction of model and classify the different network traffic classes using ensemble layer of classifiers.

As we are aware that image makes the human visualize the existence of entities in nature and helps individual to get the feel of the services without solely relying on the written messages. With the headway in image capturing devices, image data are being generated in high dimensions. However, processing the captured images plays a vital role that is gaining importance with its applicability in several filed of research. Numerous methods for processing of imagery have been developed nevertheless; existing methods still confines as the complexities of image increases with several coherent disadvantages such as greater amount of processing time and effort, prone to errors, inefficient outcome in terms of Accuracy Assessment parameters. Further, to classify the images into one of the several categories available in the database, typically make use of text associated with the image. The content-based image retrieval considering the visual information contained in the image itself is a challenging area to work on with.

There are primarily two types of ARMD: (i) dry, and (ii) wet. The dry ARMD is the common form of ARMD. It typically starts with the formation of small pale yellowish deposits called drusen under the retina, causing atrophy at the macula, which is known as age-related macular degeneration. This, in turn, affects the central vision of a person. The wet ARMD is caused due to the abnormal growth of blood vessels under the retina. These vessels are known as the choroidal neovascular membrane break through the retina and bleed. They finally lead to either scarring at the macula or atrophic changes leading to severe visual impairment. Hence, the wet ARMD progresses faster and leads to an irreversible loss of sight. Therefore, it is advisable to go for routine eye screening, especially for elderly subjects. Although the ARMD cannot be fully cured, an accurate early detection can impede the progression of vision loss. However, manual diagnosis of ARMD is difficult and subjective. Thus, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system can be utilized to automatically screen the eyes and give an accurate diagnosis of the type of ARMD. In this study, we propose a novel technique to identify normal, dry, and wet ARMD. A total of 945 fundus images (404 normal, 517 dry ARMD, and 24 wet ARMD) are used in this proposed framework. The Pyramid of Histograms of Orientation Gradients (PHOG) technique is implemented in this work to capture the subtle changes in the pixels of fundus images. Various nonlinear features are extracted from the PHOG descriptor. To balance the number of images in three classes, an adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) approach is used. Two feature selection techniques namely ant colony optimization genetic algorithm (ACO-GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to select the best performing method. The selected features are subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine highly significant features for classification. The proposed system has achieved a maximum accuracy of 85.1%, sensitivity of 87.2%, and specificity of 80% using nine features selected by PSO feature selection method with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. It has obtained a maximum accuracy of 83.3%, sensitivity of 82.6%, and specificity of 84.8% using ten features selected by ACO-GA feature selection method with SVM classifier. The proposed CAD system yielded promising performance and thus, can be used as a practical adjunct ARMD screening tool in the clinical setting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Age-related macular degeneration; Ant colony optimization genetic algorithm; Fundus image; Particle swarm optimization; Pyramid of histograms of oriented gradients; Support vector machine,Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Blood vessels; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Graphic methods; Ophthalmology; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Age-related macular degeneration; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Feature selection methods; Fundus image; Histogram of oriented gradients; Histograms of oriented gradients; Neovascular membranes; Pyramid of Histograms of Orientation Gradients (PHOG); Analysis of variance (ANOVA),"Acharya, U.R.; Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, 535 Clementi Road, Singapore; email: aru@np.edu.sg",,Elsevier B.V.,18777503,,,,English,J.

The nonlinearity present in the focal (F) and non-focal (NF) EEG signals is quantified in tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) framework. First, the EEG signals of both classes are decomposed into different subbands using TQWT. Different nonlinear features namely, K-nearest neighbour entropy estimator (KnnEnt), centered correntropy (CCorrEnt), and fuzzy entropy (FzEnt), bispectral entropies, permutation entropy (PmEnt), sample entropy (SmEnt), fractal dimension (FracDm) and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) are computed from these subbands. These features reveal the complexity present in various subbands of F and NF EEG signals. Our proposed method showed highest classification accuracy of 94.06% with least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier using only KnnEnt features. The results of classification increased to 95.00% using three entropies (KnnEnt, CCorrEnt, and FzEnt) with LS-SVM classifier.

DME is graded based on the exudate location from the macula. It is clinically diagnosed using fundus images which is tedious and time-consuming. Regular eye screening and subsequent treatment may prevent the vision loss. Hence, in this work, a hybrid system based on Radon transform (RT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) are proposed for an automated detection of DME. The fundus images are subjected to RT to obtain sinograms and DWT is applied on these sinograms to extract wavelet coefficients (approximate, horizontal, vertical and diagonal). DCT is applied on approximate coefficients to obtain 2D-DCT coefficients. Further, these coefficients are converted into 1D vector by arranging the coefficients in zig-zag manner. This 1D signal is subjected to locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA). Finally, various supervised classifiers are used to classify the three classes using significant features. Our proposed technique yielded a classification accuracy of 100% and 97.01% using two and seven significant features for private and public (MESSIDOR) databases respectively. Also, a maculopathy index is formulated with two significant parameters to discriminate the three groups distinctly using a single integer. Hence, our obtained results suggest that this system can be used as an eye screening tool for diabetic subjects for DME. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Decision support system; Diabetic macular edema; Discrete cosine transform; Discrete wavelet transform; Fundus imaging; Locality sensitive discriminant analysis; Radon transform,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision support systems; Discrete wavelet transforms; Discriminant analysis; Grading; Hybrid systems; Mathematical transformations; Wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Fundus imaging; Locality sensitive discriminant analysis; Macular edema; Radon Transform; Supervised classifiers; Wavelet coefficients; Discrete cosine transforms; Article; automation; data base; diabetic macular edema; diabetic patient; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; discrete cosine transform; discrete wavelet transform; discriminant analysis; eye fundus; human; macular edema; priority journal; Radon transform; retina maculopathy; scoring system; visual system parameters; adult; aged; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic imaging; female; male; middle aged; procedures; wavelet analysis; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Diabetic Retinopathy; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Wavelet Analysis","Mookiah, M.R.K.; Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann PolytechnicSingapore",,Elsevier Ltd,104825,,CBMDA,28343061,English,Comput.

Low resolution in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) coronary videos poses a threat to calcium detection causing over-estimation in volume measurement. We introduce a correction block that counter-balances the bias introduced during the calcium detection process. Method Nineteen patients image dataset (around 40,090 frames), IRB approved, were collected using 40 MHz IVUS catheter (Atlantis® SR Pro, Boston Scientific®, pullback speed of 0.5 mm/sec). A new set of 20 generalized and well-balanced systems each consisting of three stages: (i) calcium detection, (ii) calibration and (iii) measurement, while ensuring accuracy of four soft classifiers (Threshold, FCM, K-means and HMRF) and workflow speed using five multiresolution techniques (bilinear, bicubic, wavelet, Lanczos, Gaussian Pyramid) were designed. Results of the three calcium detection methods were benchmarked against the Threshold-based method. Results All 20 well-balanced systems with calibration block show superior performance. Using calibration block, FCM versus Threshold-based method shows the highest cross-correlation 0.99 (P<0.0001), Jaccard index 0.984±0.013 (P<0.0001), and Dice similarity 0.992±0.007 (P<0.0001). The corresponding area under the curve for four calcium detection techniques is: 1.0, 1.0, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively.

Differentially expressed (DE) gene analysis of microarray data followed by functional classification provides an idea of alteration of biological functions associated with disease progression. In this context, microRNA (miRNA) microarray data analysis for functional classification is still a challenge, since most of the functions of miRNAs are yet to be discovered. The rationale of this study is to identify a subset of miRNA from microarray data, efficiency of which were evaluated using support vector machine for optimal supervised classification of OLK and OLK transformed oral squamous cell carcinoma (LK-OSCC). Another study was performed to identify subset of DE genes from gene expression database for OLK and LK-OSCC differentiation. This study further considered functional classification of target genes of DE miRNAs and DE genes and compared to understand OLK associated carcinogenesis mechanism, which is first of its kind. Result suggested that group of eight DE miRNAs, viz. miR-21, miR-142-3p, mir-223, miR-637, miR-142-5p, miR-1184 and miR-31? could classify OLK and LK-OSCC with 100% sensitivity and specificity. During comparative assessment of functionally classified target genes of DE miRNAs and mRNAs, it was observed that beside few common functional gene sets, the exclusive DE genes in miRNA target gene groups were TBC1 domain family and kinesin family while histone clusters, WD repeat domain genes, ribosomal proteins, transmembrane proteins and olfactory related proteins were significant in DE genes. Pathway analysis of the DE genes mainly showed to affect pathways especially for glutathione, drug and tyrosine metabolism as well as melanogenesis. The significant biological processes found to be affected by gene ontology analysis were mainly the response to lipid peroxide and altered secondary metabolite and melanin biosynthesis. © 2016 IEEE.",functional analysis; miRNA target gene; Oral Cancer; Oral leukoplakia,Amino acids; Biochemistry; Classification (of information); Diseases; Functional analysis; Genes; Metabolites; Pathology; Proteins; RNA; Functional classification; Microarray data analysis; Mirna targets; Oral cancer; Oral leukoplakia; Oral squamous cell carcinomata; Sensitivity and specificity; Supervised classification; Gene expression,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

The necessity of proper information has increased. The most basic tools which provide this service are browser. It traverses the data as per user's query and gives the search results of all related information. Hence, it becomes a time consuming process to find required information. In this paper, the focus is done on content based data mining using ontology and text feature extraction. Content based data mining process focuses on domain of the data. Ontology, itself is a domain based data set information system that will help to achieve required data retrieval in a more appropriate way. The proposed system uses k means clustering algorithm for creation of flat clusters. Flat clusters are the primary classification or clusters of data that are used for Hierarchical clustering. For the proposed system Hierarchical Fuzzy Relational Eigenvector Centrality-based Clustering Algorithm (HFRECCA) is used. This technique of clustering is very fast and gives more accurate results. For more appropriate data retrieval, this system uses text feature extraction algorithm. This algorithm will help to reduce the noisy data from data sets. A noise free data will help to perform better data retrieval process. Implemented system works over various types of text file such as PDF,.txt, DOC, DOCX.

After that two multi-resolution filters are employed to represent the MFBT and OFBT at different resolutions. A 36 element feature vector is formed from the multi-resolution MFBT and OFBT images which are then classified using a feed-forward artificial neural network with gradient decent training rule.

It learns patterns in terms of n-dimensional hyper line segment (HLS). Modified fuzzy hyperline segment neural network (MFHLSNN) is a modified version of FHLSNN that improves the quality of reasoning and recall time per pattern using modified fuzzy membership function. However, for the large training patterns MFHLSNN creates a large number of HLS, which increases training and recall time and thus, is limited only to smaller dataset on sequential machines/implementations. In this paper, we proposed a new fuzzy membership function for MFHLSNN. Using new membership function architecture is called Updated FHLSNN (UFHLSNN). We also proposed GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel implementation of UFHLSNN, for larger pattern datasets, using NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The updated membership function is found superior than the original one, in terms of number of arithmetic operations. The maximum speed-up achieved in training and recognition phases are 12× and 29×, respectively for the used datasets.

SQL Injection Attack (SQLIA) has been a major security threat on web applications since over 15 years. Detecting SQLIA at runtime is a challenging problem because of extreme heterogeneity of the attack vectors. This paper explores application of node centrality metrics to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for identifying malicious queries containing SQL injection attacks. The WHERE clause portion of SQL queries are first normalized into a sequence of tokens and then modeled as interaction networks, from which centrality of the nodes are computed. After applying feature selection by information gain method, the centrality scores of high ranking nodes are used to train the SVM classifier. We experiment with four centrality measures popularly used in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The results on five sample web applications built with PHP/MySQL show that this technique can effectively detect SQLIA with minimal performance overhead. Designed for the database firewall layer, the approach can protect multiple websites on a shared server, which is another advantage. © 2016 IEEE.",feature selection; information gain; node centrality; SQL injection detection; SVM; token interaction network,Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Network security; Personal computing; Support vector machines; Centrality measures; Database firewalls; Information gain; Information gain method; Interaction networks; node centrality; SQL injection; Sql injection attacks; Computer crime,"Kar, D.; Department of CSE, Silicon Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: debabrata.kar@silicon.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

While considering the lumbar Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), identification of pathologies is a complex task as the size of the soft tissues may vary. Before recognizing the injury in the soft tissue, it is necessary to identify in which soft tissue, the pathology occurs. In order to address this issue, the classification of lumbar Intervertebral Discs (IVDs) on lumbar MRI is performed. The classification is determined after feature extraction on the region of interest. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is applied to extract the features and a model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. A multi-class classification is performed on 80 subjects, both T1-weighted and T2-weighted, with a total of 960 Intervertebral Discs. The result of the research work done in this paper gives 71.53% accuracy on the classification of Lumbar MR Images.

When density of a zone increases to a certain approximated level, people's safety can be endangered. Detection of human is a prerequisite for density estimation, tracking, activity recognition and anomaly detection even in non congested areas. This paper presents a robust hybrid approach for face detection in crowd by combining the skin color segmentation and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) with Support Vector Machine(SVM) architecture. Initially, image enhancement is performed to improve the detection rate. An edge preserving pyramidal approach is applied for multiscale representation of an image. Skin color segmentation is done with combination of YCbCr and RGB color model, and HOG features are extracted from the segmented skin region. We trained the SVM classifier by Muct and FEI databases which consist 751 and 2800 face images respectively. The accuracy of this approach is evaluated by testing it on BAO multiple face database and on various manually collected images captured in surveillance areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the supplementary skin color segmentation with HOG is more potent for increasing the detection rate than using HOG features only. The proposed approach achieves 98.02% accuracy which is higher in comparison to Viola Jones and fast face detection method. © 2016 IEEE.",Oriented gradient feature; RGB and YCbCr; Skin color segmentation; SVM,Classification (of information); Color; Network security; Support vector machines; Activity recognition; Density estimation; Face detection methods; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Multiscale representations; Oriented gradients; RGB and YCbCr; Skin-color segmentation; Face recognition,,De Pietro G.Dipanda A.Chbeir R.Gallo L.Yetongnon K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The problem especially becomes challenging when the camera used to capture the video is dynamic. In this paper, we analyse the performance of statistical aggregation (SA) techniques on various pre-trained convolutional neural network(CNN) models to address this problem. The proposed approach works by extracting CNN activation features for a number of frames in a video and then uses an aggregation scheme in order to obtain a robust feature descriptor for the video. We show through results that the proposed approach performs better than the-state-of-the art works for the Maryland and YUPenn dataset. The final descriptor obtained is powerful enough to distinguish among dynamic scenes and is even capable of addressing the scenario where the camera motion is dominant and the scene dynamics are complex. Further, this paper shows an extensive study on the performance of various aggregation methods and their combinations.

Numerous researches have been proposed to ward off the inherent security risks, though these solutions are not enough to identify and remove all the vulnerabilities. In this paper, a self-adaptive IV-Phase MAP Security Architecture is proposed, which is inspired by the Biological Immune System, with the prime objective of detecting unknown malicious mobile agents. In this context, data mining methods are studied for the detection of unknown malicious executable. In particular, Boyer Moore pattern matching algorithm and N-gram feature analysis of mobile agent using a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, facilitate the discovery of known and unknown malicious content from incoming mobile agent in the proposed architecture, and protects against the Man In The Middle (MITM) attack, the Masquerading Attack, the Replay attack, the Repudiation attack and the Unauthorized Access Attack. The architecture is designed and implemented in IBM Aglets. A comprehensive 5-fold cross validation scheme on a large collection of malicious and non-malicious files is performed while performing Classification technique involving Feature Selection Method. The propitious experimental outcomes express that the performance (time and security) and accuracy of proposed architecture outperform the earlier known related schemes and makes the proposed architecture suitable for MAP protection in the Mobile Agent Environment (MAE). Above all, these findings exhibit wide-ranging newness, since the concept of machine learning has never been employed so far in the sphere of Mobile Agents System (MAS). Hence the proposed work is likely to be of great interest to the researchers who particularly deal with MAS security. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Feature selection; K-nearest neighbor classification; Malicious mobile agent; N-gram feature extraction; Nonce-based authentication; Pattern matching,Classification (of information); Computer architecture; Computer viruses; Data mining; Feature extraction; Image matching; Immune system; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Pattern matching; Biological immune system; Classification technique; Distributed environments; Feature selection methods; K-nearest neighbor classification; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack; N-grams; Mobile agents,"Hans, R.; Assistant Professor, Department of CSE, DAV UniversityIndia; email: rahulhans@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006783227

However, several widely-used Mercer kernels map data to a Hilbert sphere in RKHS. For such directional data in RKHS, linear analyses can be unnatural or suboptimal. Hence, we propose an alternative to kPCA by extending principal nested spheres (PNS) to RKHS without needing the explicit lifting map underlying the kernel, but solely relying on the kernel trick. It generalizes the model for the residual errors by penalizing the Lp norm / quasi-norm to enable robust learning from corrupted training data. Our method, termed robust kernel PNS (rkPNS), relies on the Riemannian geometry of the Hilbert sphere in RKHS. Relying on rkPNS, we propose novel algorithms for dimensionality reduction and classification (with and without outliers in the training data). Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that rkPNS compares favorably to the state of the art. © 2016 IEEE.",,Classification (of information); Geometry; Pattern recognition; Spheres; Dimensionality reduction; Directional data; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Novel algorithm; Real-world datasets; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Riemannian geometry; State of the art; Principal component analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10514651,9.78151E+12,PICRE,,English,Proc.

Our proposed approach is based on deep neural network framework. We investigate the role of convolution neural network (CNN) and propose two model variants. We evaluate the proposed approach on the benchmark datasets of BioCreative-II Interaction Article Subtask (IAS) data sets. Effectiveness of our proposed model is evident with the significant performance gains, 2.8 % in terms of F-measure and 5 % in terms of accuracy over the traditional models. © 2016 IEEE.",Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Interaction Article Subtask (IAS); Protein Protein Interaction (PPI); Word Embedding,Classification (of information); Convolution; Data mining; Deep neural networks; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Proteins; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Document Classification; Learning architectures; Protein-protein interactions; Subtask; Text mining techniques; Word Embedding; Deep learning,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10514651,9.78151E+12,PICRE,,English,Proc.

This paper introduces a novel algorithm for HEp-2 cell pattern recognition, which can be embedded into the CAD. This is the first time HEp-2 cell Classification system separated intermediate and positive cells before preprocessing and processed further for classification to achieve better accuracy. The design used spectral, statistical and textural features along with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification. The algorithm introduced in this paper was tested using ICPR 2016 IIF HEp-2 cell dataset of frequently occurring six distinct fluorescence patterns by computer simulation.

The main novelty of the present study is introduction of supervised layerwise training of DCNN architecture in document classification tasks for better initialization of weights of individual DCNNs. Each DCNN of the committee is trained for a specific part or the whole document. Also, here we used the principle of generalized stacking for combining the normalized outputs of all the members of the DCNN committee.

Multi-view learning algorithms aim at exploiting the complementary information present in different views for clustering and classification tasks. Several multi-view clustering methods that aim at partitioning objects into clusters based on multiple representations of the object have been proposed. Almost all of the proposed methods assume that each example appears in all views or at least there is one view containing all examples. In real-world settings this assumption might be too restrictive. Recent work on Partial View Clustering addresses this limitation by proposing a Non-negative Matrix Factorization based approach called PVC. Our work extends the PVC work in two directions. First, the current PVC algorithm is designed specifically for two-view datasets. We extend this algorithm for the k partial-view scenario. Second, we extend our k partial-view algorithm to include view specific graph laplacian regularization. This enables the proposed algorithm to exploit the intrinsic geometry of the data distribution in each view. The proposed method, which is referred to as GPMVC (Graph Regularized Partial Multi-View Clustering), is compared against 7 baseline methods (including PVC) on 5 publicly available text and image datasets. In all settings the proposed GPMVC method outperforms all baselines. For the purpose of reproducibility, we provide access to our code. © 2016 IEEE.",,Classification (of information); Factorization; Matrix algebra; Pattern recognition; Classification tasks; Data representations; Intrinsic geometry; Multi-view clustering; Multi-view learning; Multiple representation; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Real-world datasets; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10514651,9.78151E+12,PICRE,,English,Proc.

This paper proposes a new method for categorizing different types of video text frames, namely, videos containing advertisement, signboard, license plate, front page of book or magazine, street view, and video of general items, for better text detection and recognition rate. We propose symmetry features using gradient vector flow for Canny and Sobel edge images of each input frame to identify candidate edge components. Then for a candidate edge component image, we extract both global and local features using colors from different channels in a new way. Besides, the proposed method extracts statistical and structural features from the spatial distribution of candidate pixels in a multi-scale environment. Lastly, the extracted features are fed to a logistic classifier for categorization. The features extracted locally and globally are tested both separately and altogether in terms of confusion matrix. The performance of the proposed categorization method is evaluated through several text detection and recognition experiments before and after categorization.

Here we model the task as a classification problem, where training data contains only Bengali handwritten samples and testing is performed on English handwritten texts. This work is based on the understanding that a writer has some inherent stroke characteristics that are independent of the script in which (s)he writes.

Subsequently, various techniques for combining classifiers at each of these levels have been proposed in the literature. Many popular methods entail scaling and normalizing the scores obtained by each classifier to a common numerical range before combining the normalized scores using the sum rule or another classifier. In this research, we explore an alternative method to combine classifiers at the score level. The Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm has traditionally been utilized to convert classifier match scores to confidence values that model posterior probabilities for test data. The PAV algorithm and other score normalization techniques have studied the same problem without being aware of each other. In this first ever study to combine the two, we propose the PAV algorithm for classifier fusion on publicly available NIST multi-modal biometrics score dataset. We observe that it provides several advantages over existing techniques and find that the interpretation learned by the PAV algorithm is more robust than the scaling learned by other popular normalization algorithms such as min-max. Moreover, the PAV algorithm enables the combined score to be interpreted as confidence and is able to further improve the results obtained by other approaches. We also observe that utilizing traditional normalization techniques first for individual classifiers and then normalizing the fused score using PAV offers a performance boost compared to only using the PAV algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.",,Numerical methods; Pattern recognition; Classifier fusion; Combining classifiers; Individual classifiers; Multi-modal biometrics; Multiple classifiers; Normalization algorithms; Normalized scores; Score normalization; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10514651,9.78151E+12,PICRE,,English,Proc.

The same measure is further applied to detect the foreground pixels against the stationary background classes.

The characteristically similar nature of the melanocytic skin lesions specifically melanoma and dysplastic nevi make the diagnosis more subjective and time consuming, even for expert clinicians. Computer aided diagnostic system has a great impact on the notable discrimination of two closely similar classes of skin diseases by extracting a large number of effective features. In this reported work fractal geometry has been used for both skin lesion border irregularity measurement and texture features extraction. Here, in fractal based texture analysis technique the dermoscopic images have been decomposed into a set of binary images to extract more effective texture features from different grey regions of the image. From each of the image grey region, some statistical features have been extracted along with the fractal dimension measurement to quantify the intensity variation in that region. In this paper it has been established that the extraction of texture information from different small sub regions of the original image using fractal texture analysis increases the classification performance for both the classes. An analysis of the dependence of the performance of classifier using fractal based texture analysis, on the number of decomposed binary images, has been discussed.

The multispectral images are main source of information on geo-surface. Classification is used to obtain this data and constructing maps. In general, the classification is crisp and assigns a single class to each image elements or pixel, known as hard classification. However, there is another consequence that some pixels may not purely belongs to single class. This problem treated as mixed pixel problem. Mixed pixels are big issue in term of hard or static classification. Due to hard classification the significant amount of result is lost. but we can bring under control this problem to using soft classification. Classification is not completed without assessment of accuracy. Accuracy assessment of classification play vital role in term of classification and it tells amount of accuracy for the classification process. Accuracy assessment is an important issue for validation of image classification. There are several tools that provide accuracy analysis using confusion matrix, Kappa coefficients. This assessment is based on the rule of single class per pixel known as hard classification. Further for Mixed pixels in classification handled by soft classification i.e. assigning membership of each class to that mixed pixel and accuracy assessment is also differ from hard classification as each pixel have membership proportion for every class which involved in classification schema. Further assessing accuracy also depends upon how samples have been taken from census of classified output. This paper study is to focus on comparative study in soft classification approaches and accuracy assessment with reference data and without reference data pixels. © 2016 IEEE.",Entropy; Hard Classification; Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC); Possibilistic C-Means (PCM); Soft Classification Fuzzy C-Means (FCM),Entropy; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Pixels; Remote sensing; Surveys; Classification process; Comparative studies; Fuzzy C mean; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Multispectral images; Possibilistic C-means; Static classification; Uncertainty estimation; Classification (of information),,Dwivedi R.K.Hamid A.B.A.Saxena A.K.Agarwal A.K.Ather D.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) records the neurological activity in the brain and it is used to identify epilepsy. Visual inspection of EEG signals is a time-consuming process and it may lead to human error. Feature extraction and classification are two main steps that are required to build an automated epilepsy detection framework. Feature extraction reduces the dimensions of the input signal by retaining informative features and the classifier assigns a proper class label to the extracted feature vector. Our aim is to present effective feature extraction techniques for automated epileptic EEG signal classification. Methods In this study, two effective feature extraction techniques (Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern [LNDP] and One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern [1D-LGP]) have been introduced to classify epileptic EEG signals. The classification between epileptic seizure and non-seizure signals is performed using different machine learning classifiers. The benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset provided by the University of Bonn is used in this research. The classification performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The classifiers used are the Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiments have been repeated for 50 times. Results LNDP and 1D-LGP feature extraction techniques with ANN classifier achieved the average classification accuracy of 99.82% and 99.80%, respectively, for the classification between normal and epileptic EEG signals. Eight different experimental cases were tested. The classification results were better than those of some existing methods. Conclusions This study suggests that LNDP and 1D-LGP could be effective feature extraction techniques for the classification of epileptic EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; Feature extraction; Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern (LNDP); One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern (1D-LGP),Brain; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image retrieval; Learning systems; Neural networks; Neurology; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram signals; Feature extraction and classification; Feature extraction techniques; Local gradient patterns; Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern (LNDP); World Health Organization; Biomedical signal processing; Article; artificial neural network; decision tree; disease classification; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; extraction; machine learning; priority journal; research; seizure; support vector machine,"Jaiswal, A.K.India; email: abegiitdhanbad@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

In the current paper we have made an attempt to solve the gene expression data clustering problem using a multiobjective optimization based semi-supervised classification technique with the aim to attain good quality partitions by using few labeled data. In order to generate the labeled data, initially Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is applied. In order to automatically determine the partitioning, multiple cluster centers corresponding to a cluster are encoded in the form of a string. In order to compute the quality of the obtained partitioning, values of five objective functions are computed. The effectiveness of this proposed semi-supervised clustering technique is demonstrated on five publicly available benchmark gene expression data sets. Comparison results with the existing techniques for gene expression data clustering prove that the proposed method is the most effective one. Statistical and biological significance tests have also been carried out. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",AMOSA; Cluster validity index; Gene expression data clustering; Multiobjective optimization; Semi-supervised classification,Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Fuzzy clustering; Genes; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Supervised learning; AMOSA; Biological significance; Cluster validity indices; Fuzzy C means clustering; Gene expression data clustering; Semi-supervised classification; Semi-supervised Clustering; Unsupervised classification; Gene expression,"Alok, A.K.; Computer Science Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: abhayalok@iitp.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,18688071,,,,English,Intl.

In this study, we demonstrate the applications of supervised machine learning methods to reduce the irrelevance in microarray data series and thereby extract robust molecular markers to track biological processes. The methodology has been illustrated by analyzing whole genome expression studies on bone-implant integration (ossointegration). Being a biological process, osseointegration is known to leave a trail of genetic footprint during the course. In spite of existence of enormous amount of raw data in public repositories, researchers still do not have access to a panel of genes that can definitively track osseointegration. The results from our study revealed panels comprising of matrix metalloproteinases and collagen genes were able to track osseointegration on implant surfaces (MMP9 and COL1A2 on micro-textured; MMP12 and COL6A3 on superimposed nano-textured surfaces) with 100% classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, our analysis showed the importance of the progression of the duration in establishment of the mechanical connection at bone-implant surface. The findings from this study are expected to be useful to researchers investigating osseointegration of novel implant materials especially at the early stage. The methodology demonstrated can be easily adapted by scientists in different fields to analyze large databases for other biological processes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Gene ontology; Microarray data; Osseointegration; Statistical classifiers; Surface texture,Bone; Classification (of information); Gene expression; Genes; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Gene ontology; Microarray data; Osseointegration; Statistical classifier; Surface textures; Metal implants; COL1A2 protein; COL6A3 protein; collagen; gelatinase B; macrophage elastase; unclassified drug; biological marker; titanium; Article; biomechanics; bone implant; bone regeneration; classification; classifier; gene expression; human; microarray analysis; molecular genetics; sensitivity and specificity; supervised machine learning; surface property; bone; genetic marker; machine learning; osseointegration; prostheses and orthoses; Biomarkers; Bone and Bones; Genetic Markers; Machine Learning; Osseointegration; Prostheses and Implants; Titanium,"Chakravorty, N.email: nishant@smst.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Academic Press Inc.,15320464,,JBIOB,28288857,English,J.

The eye and mouth regions are the most important components for facial emotion recognition. Most of the existing approaches have not utilized the eye and mouth temporal features for high recognition rate. This paper proposes a novel approach for recognizing the facial emotions using eye and mouth temporal features with high recognition rate. The local features are extracted in each frame by using Gabor Wavelet with selected scale and orientations. This feature is passed to ensemble classifier for detecting the location of face region. From the signature of the face region, the eye and the mouth regions are detected using ensemble classifier. Blocks of temporal features are extracted from the signature of the eye and the mouth regions in the consecutive frames. In each block, the eye and mouth temporal features are normalized by Z-score normalization technique and encoded into binary pattern features. Concatenate the eye and mouth encoded temporal features to generate the enhanced temporal feature. Multi-class Adaboost is used to select and classify the discriminative temporal features for recognizing the facial emotion.

Epilepsy is one of the brain's disorder. Automated diagnosis of epilepsy can be done by measuring and analyzing the nonlinear and non-stationary trends in EEG signals. This paper introduces a new diagnostic approach for analysis and classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. In time-scale domain, the tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) can reliably represent the sparsity in oscillatory signals. The proposed methodology begins with application of TQWT to efficiently characterize the non-stationary behavior and sparsity of EEG signals. TQWT decomposes the considered signals into a valuable set of band-limited signals termed as sub-bands for better feature extraction. Kraskov entropy is a nonlinear parameter to detect the presence of nonlinear trends in the signals. After decomposition, Kraskov entropy is computed from the specific sub-band as a decisive feature in order to discriminate seizure-free from the epileptic seizure EEG signals. Subsequently, obtained feature vectors are used for classifying the seizure and seizure-free EEG signals using the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. While doing analysis, it has been observed that value of proposed Kraskov entropy based feature is significantly higher for seizure EEG signals as compared to that of seizure-free EEG signals. Furthermore, the experimental results of this work has demonstrated significant values of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient. It is noteworthy that proposed framework uses single feature to diagnose the epilepsy accurately. Also the application of the proposed work on EEG data from the University of Bonn, Germany highlights the consistency and in some cases superiority of the proposed method over other popular methods. © 2017",Classification; Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal; Epilepsy; Kraskov entropy; Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM); Tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT),Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Entropy; Feature extraction; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurology; Neurophysiology; Nonlinear analysis; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Correlation coefficient; Electroencephalogram signals; Epilepsy; Least square support vector machines; Non-linear parameters; Non-stationary behaviors; Tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT); Signal detection; Article; correlation coefficient; decomposition; diagnostic procedure; electroencephalogram; entropy; human; Kraskov entropy; oscillation; parameters; priority journal; seizure; signal processing; support vector machine; tunable Q wavelet transform; wavelet analysis,"Patidar, S.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Goa, Farmagudi, India; email: shivnarayn.patidar@nitgoa.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

Clusters of microcalcifications (MCCs) are symptoms of DCIS that are recognized by mammography. Selection of robust features vector is the process of selecting an optimal subset of features from a large number of available features in a given problem domain after the feature extraction and before any classification scheme. Feature selection reduces the feature space that improves the performance of classifier and decreases the computational burden imposed by using many features on classifier. Selection of an optimal subset of features from a large number of available features in a given problem domain is a difficult search problem. For n features, the total numbers of possible subsets of features are 2n. Thus, selection of an optimal subset of features problem belongs to the category of NP-hard problems. In this paper, an attempt is made to find the optimal subset of MCCs features from all possible subsets of features using genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO). For simulation, a total of 380 benign and malignant MCCs samples have been selected from mammogram images of DDSM database.

Under feature extraction, statistical features like skewness, standard deviation, variance, root-mean-square (RMS) value, kurtosis, range, minimum value, maximum value, sum, median, and crest factor are considered as features of the signal in the fault diagnostics. These features are extracted from vibration signals obtained from the experimental setup through a piezoelectric sensor. The vibration signals from the sensor are captured for normal tooth, wear tooth, broken tooth, and broken tooth under load. The feature extraction is done and the best features are selected using decision tree (J48 algorithm). The selected best features are used to train the fuzzy classifier for the fault diagnosis.

This thermal PDVP imaging based human recognition methodology has been specifically employed to encounter the challenging crisis of intrusion posed by imposters. To address the Small Sample Size (SSS) problem, intrinsic to many biometric applications, each image is transformed into multiple patches, leading to an increase in the total number of samples. In a bid to make the classification strategy less sensitive to the choice of patch-size, the present paper proposes a new enhanced ensemble learning for the patch based CRC (PCRC) algorithm, where margin maximization is carried out using exponential squared loss minimization. This work also proposes how this loss minimization can be achieved by a stochastic optimization algorithm and solves this problem using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. In this context, a new ABC variant, called modified interactive artificial bee colony (MI-ABC) algorithm, has also been proposed, which has been demonstrated to outperform the basic ABC and its several modern variants.

Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub-meter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250-m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90% for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL2014) were then used in the development of the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL2014). ACL2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95%. Based on the ACL2014, the African continent had 296 Mha of net cropland areas (260 Mha cultivated plus 36 Mha fallows) and 330 Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260 Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90.6% (236 Mha) was rainfed and just 9.4% (24 Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15% of the world's population, but only about 6% of world's irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95 Mha during season 1, 117 Mha during season 2, and 84 Mha continuous. About 58% of the rainfed and 39% of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (June-September). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL2003 to ACL2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1 Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1 Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250-m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results. © 2017 The Authors",Africa; Automated cropland mapping algorithm; Classification; Cropland mapping; Google Earth Engine; MODIS; Remote sensing products,Automation; Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Conformal mapping; Crops; Engines; Image reconstruction; Irrigation; Mean square error; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series; Africa; Cloud computing platforms; Google earths; Mapping algorithms; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root mean square errors; Mapping; agricultural land; agroecology; algorithm; image classification; Internet; mapping method; MODIS; NDVI; pixel; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; time series; traditional knowledge; Africa,"Xiong, J.; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2255, N.

At the same time, several types of machine learning methods do not depend on such prior explicitly expressed domain information. However, such methods require especially in case of operating learning phase, only data sets are being considered. The recent work introduces a new model called Regularized Monotonic Fuzzy SVM (RMC-FSVM) for solving problem that is mentioned above. The scalability with respect to RMC-FSVM mechanisms have been proposed for mitigating the respective overheads corresponding to requirements of memory and time. The Reduce framework is integrated to RMC-FSVM referred to as MRRMC-FSVM which can be efficiently parallelized and scaled to very big problems along with the count of hundreds of thousands of training vectors is described. In MRRMC-FSVM, partial outcomes are later integrated followed by 'Cascade' mode of filtration in the MRRMC-FSVM. The approach of Cascade based MRRMC-FSVM can extend over multiple numbers of processors having a reduced communication overhead and needs very less memory, as the kernel matrices are way much smaller in comparison to a regular MRRMC-FSVM. In the present study, the experimental work implies the scope for integrating the previously known monotonicity constraints along with the framework of MRRMC-FSVM as it considered to be the potential way to overcome the scalability issue seen the datasets and accomplished greater accuracy while applying to classification challenges. © 2016 IEEE.",Data mining; Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (SVM); Map Reduce Framework (MR); monotonicity constraint; prior knowledge; regularization,Classification (of information); Data mining; Filtration; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Scalability; Fuzzy support vector machines; Map-reduce; Monotonicity constraint; Prior knowledge; regularization; Support vector machines,,Satheesh Kumar J.Devi T.Rajeswari R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Additionally one more measurement feature based on frequency measurement of features is added to reduce the error rate of classifier and to increase the prediction rate with more accuracy. The relevant features related to class labels are selected by using a Partial Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to reduce overhead of classifier.

Web Applications as the new task-centric and action-oriented facilities have assumed a distinguished role in today's Web. At the same time, faults in these Web Applications are tedious and hard to test due to the labor and resource intensive nature of testing. Thus, making it essential to use automated strategies like fault based testing that can test the continuously advancing web. Fault based testing uses fault classification as a baseline to make testing cost-effective and efficient, hence making fault classification necessary. Fault classification in Web Applications is a course of action of developing models to segregate the various kinds of faults for real world fault based testing. Manual classification tends to be strenuous and therefore in this paper, we intend to predict an efficient automated model which will classify the faults. Our model uses Text Mining and Machine Learning technique to classify the faults of three open source Web Applications, namely, the qaManager, bitWeaver and WebCalender. We provide a comparative study among four models in which different Machine Learning techniques are used namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Multinomial Naïve Bayes. To analyze the performance of these models, Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained from Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and 10-fold validation are used. Results show that all considered Machine Learning techniques prove to be efficient in the classification of faults. Apart from this, analysis also shows that the performance of Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier is better than the other three classifiers. © 2017 ACM.",Classification; Decision tree; Faults; Naïve Bayes; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Text mining; Web,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Faulting; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sodium; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Swarm intelligence; Text processing; Area under the curves; Comparative studies; Fault classification; Fault-based testing; Machine learning techniques; Manual classification; Receiver operating characteristics; Text mining; Education,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Even though cloud providers use different authentication policies, the sensitive data is still prone to attacks. In order to provide confidentiality, integrity and privacy, cloud users employ encryption schemes, there are various encryption technique used. Each of these encryption techniques has its own hindrance such as AES is a time consuming encryption algorithm. Hence, whichever encryption used, should satisfy data confidentiality and integrity. Homomorphic encryption is a reliable encryption technique which ensures data confidentiality and integrity. I propose a novel encryption and decryption technique which satisfies data confidentiality and integrity. This paper uses Homomorphic encryption and Location-based decryption as two different techniques to provide data security in cloud storage. The encryption process is based on Homomorphic encryption and decryption is based on user location. The location-based decryption enhances the data security in this framework.

It reduces the load of computational cost and prediction time on classification algorithm by selecting only the salient features from the data set for learning. The main challenges while applying feature selection on high dimensional data (HDD) are: handling the relevancy, redundancy and correlation between features. The proposed algorithm works with the three main steps to overcome these issues. It focuses on filtering strategy for its effectiveness in handling the data sets with large size and high dimensions. Initially to measure the relevancy of features with respect to class, fisher score is calculated for each feature independently. Next, only relevant features are passed to the clustering algorithm to check the redundancy of features. Finally the correlation between features is calculated using maximum spanning tree and the most appropriate features are filtered out. The classification accuracy of the presented approach is validated by using C4.5, IB1 and Naive Bayes classifier. The proposed algorithm gives high classification accuracy when compared against the accuracies given by three different classifiers on the datasets containing features extracted from fisher score method and dataset containing all the features or full-featured dataset. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature Selection; Fisher Score; High Dimensional Data; Kruskal's algorithm; Markov Clustering,Classifiers; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Redundancy; Trees (mathematics); Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Correlation between features; Fisher score; High dimensional data; Kruskal's algorithms; Markov clustering; Naive Bayes classifiers; Classification (of information),,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The recognition rate and computational cost of proposed approach is examined against different wavelet families and Euclidean distance measure. Feature extraction is performed using Discrete wavelet transform and Principal component analysis (DWT-PCA). In order to explore best features, experiments are carried out for DWT subband selection and for DWT wavelet selection on Symlet family and on four other different wavelet families (Daubechies, Coiflets, Discrete Meyer and Biorthogonal wavelet family). This also includes their members that vary in terms of orthogonality, symmetry, support size, vanishing moments and filter order. After generating feature vectors, classification is done by Cosine angle distance measure based nearest neighbor classifier (NNC) and its results are compared with Euclidean distance measure. As test dataset, AT&T database of 400 images of 40 people is used to establish the performance by proposed approach. Experimental results on Symlet-6 with Cosine angle distance measure based nearest neighbor classifier shows highest percentage recognition rate of 98.33 for randomly generated 120 image training set. © 2016 IEEE.",DWT-PCA; Symlets; Wavelet families,Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Feature extraction; Nearest neighbor search; Principal component analysis; Statistical tests; Wavelet transforms; Biorthogonal wavelet; Computational costs; DWT-PCA; Euclidean distance measure; Nearest Neighbor classifier; Nearest neighbor classifiers; Symlets; Wavelet families; Face recognition,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Attacks on the web are increasing day-by-day. Intrusion detection system is used to detect several types of malicious attacks that can compromise the security of a computer system. Data mining techniques are used to monitor and analyze large amount of network data & classify these network data into abnormal and normal data. Various data mining techniques like classification and clustering are applied to build Intrusion detection system. An effective Intrusion detection system needs high detection rate, low false alarm rate and high accuracy. This presents IDS uses the KDD Cup 99 dataset and completely different Data mining techniques are used on IDS for the effective detection of the abnormal and normal activities in network, that helps to develop secure information system. The multidimensional feature representation method is an important pattern classifier that facilitates correct classifications.

To find pitch a peak detection algorithm is developed which find the dominant frequencies of vowel part of speech signal and then select the fundamental frequency from them. The evaluation is done on the 200 voice samples by using POC as the accuracy parameter. Gender identification is an important step in speaker and speech recognition system. A gender dependent system reduces the size and complexity of the system. Detecting the gender from the non linguistic characteristics of the voice is well known as gender detection. To extract the gender information from the speech signal we have used a feature called pitch from voiced part of the speech signal. To extract the mentioned feature 'pitch' from the speech signal we develop a peak detection algorithm and used standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique.

Setting the prime objective of classifying different texture images, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and a modified form of Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) are implemented initially. The next phase involves use of combination of the former two methods to extract improved features. The feature vectors were obtained by defining the features on the transformed images. These texture features are classified using two classification algorithms, KNN and multiclass SVM. The results of above feature extraction techniques with individual classifiers have been compared. The comparison yields that the combination of LBP and GLRLM texture features shows better classification rate than the features obtained from individual feature extraction techniques.

Implementation of the system focuses on texture based features e.g. GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) feature plays an vital role in medical field. Selection is based on the twelve various statistical features and seven shape for extraction by applying sequential forward selection algorithm. After application of sequential forward selection algorithm Bayesian classifier was applied among classified data to get best classification. © 2016 IEEE.",Bayesian Classifier; CDF; CLAHE; CT images; GLCM; IP; LCD; Lung Cancer Detection System; MATLAB; SFA; Texture Feature Extraction,Automation; Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Diseases; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image texture; Liquid crystal displays; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Optimization; Process control; Bayesian classifier; CLAHE; CT Image; GLCM; Lung cancer detections; Texture feature extraction; Image classification,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Possible complications that can be caused by badly controlled diabetes: Eye complications, Foot complication, Skin complications, Heart problems, Hypertension, etc. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication of diabetes, affects the blood vessels in the retina. It is due to the retina not receiving enough oxygen. In this work, publically available MESSIDOR database with 1200 fundus images are considered. Due to the textural changes in the retinal fundus images texture analysis methods like statistical moments and GLCM are used and extracted 40 features. The unbalanced dataset decreases the accuracy so oversampling is done before classification. Classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests, Gradient boost, AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes used to detect the DR. Each algorithm has its own advantages and varying accuracy, SVM compared to others have good accuracy of 88.71%, Random forests technique accuracy of 83.34%, Gradient boost algorithm accuracy of 83.34%, while AdaBoost and Gaussian Naïve Bayes methods reached accuracy of 54.3% and 37.09% respectively. © 2016 IEEE.",Classification; Diabetic retinopathy; Sampling; Texture analysis,Adaptive boosting; Automation; Blood vessels; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Optimization; Process control; Sampling; Soft computing; Support vector machines; Algorithm accuracies; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic retinopathy; Retinal fundus images; Softcomputing techniques; Statistical moments; Texture analysis; Texture analysis method; Eye protection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Scalability, high dimensionality, distributed data and often it also requires huge amount of computational resources in terms of space and time to extract the hidden patterns in the data. In addition, the data has to be available at one location. But in today's era the data are often inherently distributed in several databases. Hence, due to the limited bandwidth, centralized processing of the data is highly inefficient. Therefore, distributed computing becomes very important for efficient DM, both in terms of space and time. This can be done by developing a mechanism to mine the massive data by applying DM in a non-centralized way that distributes the work load seamlessly among the available sites. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an algorithm distributed multi-class rule based classification (DiRUC) which implements repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER) at local level and then merges into a global level in a distributed manner. The algorithm first constructs the local rule sets for the distributed data and then at each iteration the local models are sent from one location to other. Finally, the global model is constructed by efficiently merging these local models and is made available at each site for further prediction of the class labels. The performance (accuracy and efficiency) analysis of the algorithm is done for the five data sets with different parameters and the result shows that the proposed approach DiRUC outperforms the normal RIPPER and Ischibuchi et al. island model. © 2016 IEEE.",Distributed data mining; HADOOP; RIPPER,Big data; Classification (of information); Computer privacy; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Iterative methods; Social sciences computing; Centralized processing; Computational resources; Distributed data mining; HADOOP; High dimensionality; Limited bandwidth; RIPPER; Rule-based classification; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Combining these techniques and some new features we design a framework for classifying facts and non-facts in news articles. We present extensive experiments on this task using several features and combinations of those on two datasets, one of which was used for subjectivity classification in previous works.

Figurative language is widely used to express emotions and are very predominant in micro-blog data. Therefore, an efficient model of emotion categorization for micro-blogs should be able to correctly represent the instances of figurative phrases in the data. However, due to their non-compositional nature, the phrasal representation of figurative language cannot be directly obtained from the constituent words and hence this requires novel approaches for addressing the problem of modeling figurative phrases in micro-blogs. Most of the existing methods of modeling figurative idiomatic phrases in traditional text data use the broader textual context available for better results. However, in case of micro-blog data, such large context is not available due to very short length of text, which poses an additional challenge. Given the need to model figurative language for emotion classification, this paper develops the novel idea of Emotion Sensitive Figurative Phrase Embedding (ESFPE) to model idiomatic phrases in micro-blog data and show upto 14% improvement in emotion classification performance over baseline.

As earlier TB detection methods do not ensure accurate results, there is an immediate action required to detect the disease with proper tools. To address this issue, a novel mechanism is proposed to detect tuberculosis in chest radiographs. The proposed method includes a three stage process of accurate detection of tuberculosis. In the first stage, lung segmentation using adaptive thresholding is utilized to segment the chest images which have different illumination. The second stage of feature extraction modifies the input image into a set of features which extracts relevant information contained in the chest image. In the third stage of process, k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (k-NN) outputs the decision that the input image is normal or abnormal. The detection process is evaluated using four performance analyzing criteria: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Simulation result shows that the accuracy of our proposed system is 4% more than the graph-cut based TB detection system. A comparison task is also performed to measure the quality of classifier among three classifiers: k-NN, support vector machine and artificial neural network classifier.

In this paper the disordered voice samples are detected by deriving Modified Mellin Transform of Log Spectrum (MMTLS) of the voice signals as the feature. Mellin Transform is an integral transform with close relation to the theory of Dirichlet series. The effect of variation in the vocal tract length with gender and age can cause unpredictable results in voice pathology detection. MMTLS is an algorithm which is scale invariant and hence provides a discriminative feature irrespective of gender and age.

Crime analysis is a systematic way of detecting and investigating patterns and trends in crime. In this work, we use various clustering approaches of data mining to analyse the crime data of Tamilnadu. The crime data is extracted from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of India. It consists of crime information about six cities namely Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem, Madurai, Thirunelvelli and Thiruchirapalli from the year 2000-2014 with 1760 instances and 9 attributes to represent the instances. K-Means clustering, Agglomerative clustering and Density Based Spatial Clustering with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms are used to cluster crime activities based on some predefined cases and the results of these clustering are compared to find the best suitable clustering algorithm for crime detection. The result of K-Means clustering algorithm is visualized using Google Map for interactive and easy understanding. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification is used for crime prediction. The performance of each clustering algorithms are evaluated using the metrics such as precision, recall and F-measure, and the results are compared.

These processes occur at faster pace than regulatory bodies can manage and the use of geo-spatial techniques has become a must if we want to have any chance for a rational planning process. In this paper, a part of a broader question ""can a 3D city model and its visualization support urban planners in obtaining a greater understanding of a given urban problem and enhance decision making?"" is explored. A 3D information rich model (3DIRM) of case area (Kannadasan Nagar, Chennai) is generated using ArcGIS and ArcScene with the following information such as, land-use, road width, permissible floor space index (FSI), height of the building, setbacks, building use etc. Classification of 3DIRM based on local zoning regulation was carried out to check with the compliance of development codes. By strictly following code compliance, the buildings in case area can be classified into three types, ordinary buildings (OB-77%), special buildings (SB-20%) and multi-storied buildings (MSB-3%), whereas as the actual development observed is OB-75%, SB-4% and MSB-21%, more than 20,000 sq.m of built-up area is added under MSB typology which has gone unnoticed by the development authority. Results suggest that having an advanced geo-spatial tool such as 3D GIS can help urban planner in enhancing the decision making processes and the implementation of zoning regulations. © 2017 ACM.",3D city model; 3D GIS; Geo-spatial technology; Urban planning,Building codes; Buildings; Classification (of information); Compliance control; Decision making; Decision support systems; Government data processing; Planning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Zoning; 3D city modeling; Code compliance; Decision making process; Decision support tools; Geo-spatial; Multi-storied buildings; Rational planning; Regulatory bodies; Urban planning,"Chundeli, F.A.; School of Planning and ArchitectureIndia; email: faizahmed.arch@gmail.com",De' R.Janowski T.Baguma R.,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Hence, there is a requirement of an efficient classification technique to reduce congestion in the network so that throughput of various applications can be increased. Classification helps in searching, sorting, retrieval, and querying of a document for the wireless networks. World Wide Web (WWW) contains huge repository of information in the form of web pages. However, size of Internet is growing day-by-day. The huge repository of information poses challenge to collect and process the relevant related information of a particular domain. So, traditional text classification techniques are difficult to apply on the rapidly growing web-based contents. Hence, novel approaches and techniques need to be devised to reduce the manual efforts in web page classification. Keeping focus on these points, this paper proposes a novel approach for multiclass classifier based on unique personality features of the web page of particular domain category for the next generation wireless networks. Personality features are collected and assigned weights in the proposed scheme. Then, the proposed classifier is trained based on these special features. Results obtained depict that proposed classifier successfully classified news domain pages, education, resume, online shopping, and research web pages from large database repository. Accuracy of the proposed classifier is found to be satisfactory from a large data set of different categories.

It is one of the major resources for production of energy because of its dependability due to the development of the technology and relatively low cost. Wind energy is converted into electrical energy using rotating blades. Due to environmental conditions and large structure, the blades are subjected to various vibration forces that may cause damage to the blades. This leads to a liability in energy production and turbine shutdown. The downtime can be reduced when the blades are diagnosed continuously using structural health condition monitoring. These are considered as a pattern recognition problem which consists of three phases namely, feature extraction, feature selection, and feature classification. In this study, statistical features were extracted from vibration signals, feature selection was carried out using a J48 decision tree algorithm and feature classification was performed using best-first tree algorithm and functional trees algorithm.

A subset of the weighted features is thus selected as the best subset for subsequent classification of the data. Two information theoretic measures, known as ‘relevancy’ and ‘redundancy’ are chosen for designing the objective functions for a very competitive Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) algorithm called ‘Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D)’. We experimentally determine the best possible constraints on the weights to be optimized. We evaluate the proposed bi-objective feature selection and weighting framework on a set of 15 standard datasets by using the popular k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. As is evident from the experimental results, our method appears to be quite competitive to some of the state-of-the-art FS methods of current interest. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by changing the choices of the optimization scheme and the classifier to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-II and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Classification; Feature selection; Feature weighting; Information measure; Multi-objective optimization,Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Information theory; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Nearest neighbor search; Optimization; Pareto principle; Redundancy; Support vector machines; Bi-objective optimization; Feature selection and weighting; Feature weighting; Information measures; Information theoretic measure; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Support vector machine (SVMs); Classification (of information),"Das, S.; Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: swagatamdas19@yahoo.co.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1678655,,,,English,Pattern Recogn.

This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. For instance a disease named little leaf disease is a hazardous disease found in pine trees in United States. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves. This paper presents an algorithm for image segmentation technique which is used for automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. It also covers survey on different diseases classification techniques that can be used for plant leaf disease detection.

This is a novel effort towards effective characterization of cervix lesions from contrast enhanced CT-Scan images to provide a reliable and objective discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. Performance of such classification models mostly depends on features used to represent samples in a training dataset. Selection of optimal feature subset here is NP-hard; where, randomized algorithms do better. In this paper, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which is a population based meta-heuristic inspired by the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves has been utilized for feature selection. The traditional GWO is applicable for continuous single objective optimization problems. Since, feature selection is inherently multi-objective; this paper proposes two different approaches for multi-objective binary GWO algorithms. One is a scalarized approach to multi-objective GWO (MOGWO) and the other is a Non-dominated Sorting based GWO (NSGWO). These are used for wrapper based feature selection that selects optimal textural feature subset for improved classification of cervix lesions. For experiments, contrast enhanced CT-Scan (CECT) images of 62 patients have been used, where all lesions had been recommended for surgical biopsy by specialist. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix based texture features are extracted from two-level decomposition of wavelet coefficients of cervix regions extracted from CECT images. The results of proposed approaches are compared with mostly used meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA) for multi-objective optimization. With better diversification and intensification, GWO obtains Pareto solutions, which dominate the solutions obtained by GA and FA when assessed on the utilized cervix lesion cases. Cervix lesions are up to 91% accurately classified as benign and malignant with only five features selected by NSGWO. A two-tailed t-test was conducted by hypothesizing the mean F-score obtained by the proposed NSGWO method at significance level = 0.05. This confirms that NSGWO performs significantly better than other methods for the real cervix lesion dataset in hand. Further experiments were conducted on high dimensional microarray gene expression datasets collected online. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performs significantly better than other methods selecting relevant genes for high-dimensional, multi-category cancer diagnosis with an average of 12.82% improvement in F-score value. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Cervix lesion characterization; Classification; Feature selection; Grey Wolf Optimizer; Multi-objective optimization; Textural features; Wavelet features; Wrapper based feature selection,Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Diseases; Feature extraction; Gene expression; Genes; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Wavelet decomposition; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Microarray gene expression; Optimizers; Single objective optimization problems; Textural feature; Two-level decomposition; Wavelet features; Wrapper-based feature selection; Classification (of information),"Sahoo, A.; JSS Academy of Technical EducationIndia; email: anitasahu1@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

To understand the nature’s biodiversity, together with computer vision (CV), the emerging ubiquitous mobile technologies are now used. Therefore, in this paper, a novel low computational, efficient, and accurate rotation-scale-translation invariant shape profile transform called Angle View Projection (AVP) is proposed. The leaf images captured via mobile devices are transformed to an AVP shape profile curve (a set of four shapelets) and then compacted using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to improve the performance of the system. It also reduces the energy consumption of the device. The algorithm is tested on five different types of leaf datasets: Flavia dataset, 100 plant species leaves dataset, Swedish database, Intelligent Computing Laboratory leaf dataset and Diseased leaf dataset. An ‘Agent’ on mobile device decides whether the module needs to offload to the Server or to compute on the device itself. The experiments carried out clearly indicates that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art with a fast response time even in a low vision environment. AVP also outperforms other methods when tested over incomplete leaves caused due to the physiological or pathological phenomenon.

Intrusion detection is a cyber security mechanism that plays an important role in securing the network. Detection rate and false alarm rate are the challenging issues to design an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Various data mining techniques are used to implement network intrusion detection. Classification is a supervised learning which predicts the class label in the data set. Single classifier fails to obtain high accuracy. Base classifiers are not capable of detecting the attacks accurately. Ensemble classifier is a combination of base classifiers. Ensemble classifier outperforms base classifiers.

The system uses a combination of machine learning and rules based techniques. The rules based component can be used in an unsupervised mode with only the dictionary databases to be loaded upfront. Classifier is a supervised block which requires training data. The system has a feedback based learning which enables the system's performance to improve with use. This paper brings out the architecture of the intent recognition system, alternate configurations, results obtained and conclusions. The key differentiator of this system is the ability to use this system for different domains with minimal supervision. © 2017 ACM.",Classifier; Dependency graph; Detection; Ensemble; Feedback; Intent; Learning; Learning; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Scoring; Stemming; Supervised; Tokenization; Unsupervised; Virtual agent,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Error detection; Feedback; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Optical variables measurement; Virtual machine; Dependency graphs; Ensemble; Intent; Learning; Scoring; Stemming; Supervised; Tokenization; Unsupervised; Virtual agent; Education,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

This directly affects the financial source of agriculturists and the human health. Hence, detection of diseases in plants, fruits and vegetables crops at early stages of development leads to reduce loss of yield and quality. The traditional approaches for disease detection requires continues monitoring and observation of farms either by farmers or by experts. But, it is very costly and time consuming. In last few years, various researchers have focused into this area to provide optimized solution. Popular methods have utilized machine learning, image processing and classification based approaches to identify and detect the diseases on agricultural products. The existing techniques for disease detection have utilized various image processing methods followed by various classification techniques.

For a partially observed ordinal rating matrix, the focus is on determining low-norm latent factor matrices U (of users) and V (of items) so as to simultaneously approximate the observed entries under some loss measure and predict the unobserved entries. When the rating matrix contains only two levels (±1), rows of V can be viewed as points in k-dimensional space and rows of U as decision hyperplanes in this space separating +1 entries from ?1 entries. When hinge/smooth hinge loss is the loss function, the hyperplanes act as maximum-margin separator. In MMMF, rating matrix with multiple discrete values is treated by specially extending hinge loss function to suit multiple levels. We view this process as analogous to extending two-class classifier to a unified multi-class classifier. Alternatively, multi-class classifier can be built by arranging multiple two-class classifiers in a hierarchical manner. In this paper, we investigate this aspect for collaborative filtering and propose an efficient and novel framework of multiple bi-level MMMFs. There is substantial saving in computational overhead. We compare our method with nine well-known algorithms on two benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms these methods on NMAE measure. We also show that our method yields latent factors of lower ranks and the trade-off between empirical and generalization error is low. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Collaborative filtering; Matrix completion; Matrix factorization,Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Factorization; Geometry; Matrix algebra; Rating; Benchmark datasets; Computational overheads; Decision hyperplanes; Generalization Error; Matrix completion; Matrix factorizations; Multi-class classifier; Two-class classifier; Collaborative filtering,"Padmanabhan, V.; Artificial Intelligence Lab, School of Computer & Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderbad-500046, AndhraPradesh, India; email: vineetcs@uohyd.ernet.in",,Elsevier Inc.,200255,,ISIJB,,English,Inf Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997765006

Facial skin analysis consists of skin texture analysis and wrinkle analysis. Gabor wavelet is used to analyze the facial skin textural changes with age progression. Wrinkle analysis detects the wrinkle density changes at particular regions on face image with age progression. The performance evaluation of proposed age classification system is carried out by using face images from PAL face database. In this paper, the performance of M-SVM classifier is compared with the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier for the task of human age classification using Gabor wavelet and wrinkle analysis.

Igneous rock is most abandoned rock in nature. The classification of Igneous rocks in its two types namely Plutonic and Volcanic is a complex and tedious job because of homogeneity between the classes. In geology this classification process has been carried out on the manual basis regularly, requiring high geological expertise. But being done manually can subject to error and leads to unnecessary delay. Hence for automating the process, pattern classification approach is used. In this paper a locally relevant database of igneous rocks involving both the rock types is considered for experimentation and testing. The grain size is considered as a discriminating textural feature for this classification problem followed by identification statistical features for textural discrimination such as Haralick features, and Laws Masks. A Radial basis function support vector machine classifier is used for the classification providing machine learning approach and giving reasonable results. But In Igneous rocks, the image classes are overlapping in the feature space. So the Classification accuracy can be further increased if the hypothesis of the multiple Support vector machine (SVM) image classifiers are combined to give a single hypothesis for the classification of an image.

From the central point chosen, Euclidean distance will be computed and on that basis clusters will be assigned to the data points. One of the drawbacks of K-means is that numbers of clusters has to be provided due to which some data points remains un-clustered.

This is due to the increase in the availability of the high volumes of data in various fields. Multiple sensors are being used to extract the data and each sensor gives multiple features. On the other side performance of a classifier depends on the type of features that are used to represent the data. But storing the high dimensional data is a challenge as they occupy more space and also demands more computational resources. In generative models like Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) based classification there is a direct correlation between the number of features used to represent the data and the number of parameters that are to be estimated. This is where the dimensionality reduction would be helpful. This paper aims to demonstrate the performance of different classifiers in the reduced subspace. Based on the literature it has been observed that non-linear projection is helpful for classification than linear projection of the data. The major objective of this paper is to show the performance of different classifiers in the reduced space after linear and non-linear projection of the data. To reduce dimensionality PCA, KPCA and Auto encoder based techniques are used and to compare the performance in original and reduced space, Classification models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers are used. © 2016 IEEE.",Gaussian mixture models (GMM); Kernel PCA (KPCA); Linear projection; Non-linear projection; Principal component analysis (PCA); Support vector machine (SVM),Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Data mining; Deep neural networks; Gaussian distribution; Image retrieval; Neural networks; Object recognition; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Vectors; Classification models; Computational resources; Dimensionality reduction; Gaussian Mixture Model; High dimensional data; Kernel PCA; Linear projections; Nonlinear projections; Data reduction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Relevance feedback has been considered as a competent technique to overcome the semantic gap problem. However most of the relevance feedback based algorithms suffer from the problem of imbalanced dataset, which means that the numbers of irrelevant images are considerably larger than the number of relevant images for training the classifier. This imbalanced dataset problem causes the degradation in the retrieval results. In order to tackle this problem of imbalanced dataset, a long-term learning approach based on random forest classifier ensemble is proposed in this paper. The long-term learning relevance feedback approach collects the user feedback information for gaining the semantic knowledge of the database images. This knowledge is then learned by random forest classifier to improve the retrieval results. In the experimental evaluation it has been observed that there is a significant improvement in classification accuracy as compared to existing technique available in the literature. A precision of 93% has been observed in 9 iterations of the relevance feedback. © 2016 IEEE.",CBIR; Long-term learning; Random forest learning; Relevance feedback; Semantic Gap,Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Decision trees; Information dissemination; Search engines; Semantics; CBIR; Long-term learning; Random forests; Relevance feedback; Semantic gap; Image retrieval,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

On comparing results with original set and identified subset, we observe that the results are compatible. The feature selection algorithm is evaluated based on the components of efficiency and effectiveness, where the time required and the optimality of the subset of the feature is considered. Based on this, we are modifying the fast clustering feature selection algorithm, to check the impact of entropy correlation coefficient on it in this paper. In the algorithm, the correlation between the features is calculated using entropy correlation coefficient instead of symmetric uncertainty and then they are divided into clusters using clustering methods based on the graph. Then, the representative features i.e. those who are strongly related to the target class are selected from them. For ensuring the algorithm's efficiency, we have adopted the Kruskal minimum spanning tree (MST) clustering method. We have compared our proposed algorithm with FAST clustering feature selection algorithm on well-known classifier namely the probability-based Naive Bayes Classifier before and after feature selection. The results, on two publicly available real-world high dimensional text data, demonstrate that our proposed algorithm produces smaller and optimal features subset and also improves classifiers performance.

Three benchmarked datasets (Cleveland, Pima and Wisconsin) from the UCI machine learning repository were used to analyze effectiveness of the proposed model. The obtained results clearly shows that the modified ant-miner outperforms the other top data mining classification algorithms like the CN2, RBF, Adaboost and Bagging in terms of accuracy.

Quality based classification of these products is being carried out manually in the industry which is tedious and expensive. Computer Vision systems can be used to automate the classification process. Automation can reduce the production cost and improve the overall quality. A computer vision system captures the image of the underlying object and transmits it to an image processor. The processor, after processing the image, presents it to a pattern recognizer. The recognizer performs the quality assessments and classifies the underlying object into pre-specified quality classes. Previous studies in this regard used minimal features to perform classification which reduces the accuracy. In the proposed approach more features are used which significantly improves the automation process. Automation process faces several challenges like identifying appropriate features and the best classifier. This study tries to grade cashew nuts based on external features like color, texture, shape and size. The effect of various pre-processing operations on the grading process is also studied. Five different classifiers were used and their performance in terms of accuracy is observed. Among the classifiers, Back Propagation Neural Network proved to be the most optimal. © 2016 IEEE.",Automation; Image Processing; Machine Learning,Agricultural machinery; Agricultural products; Agriculture; Automation; Backpropagation; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Grading; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Automation process; Back propagation neural networks; Classification process; Computer vision system; External features; Pattern recognizers; Pre-processing operations; Quality assessment; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It has been observed that dynamic visualization of power system cannot be achieved effectively by the use of the SCADA system because of the low sampling rate. But, paradigm shift in grid monitoring, online fault detection and offline post disturbance analysis can be achieved with the introduction of synchrophasor technology alternatively known as PMU. When the PMU is deployed in the grid, the grid dynamics can be monitored at sub-second level from the control centers. Power system faults is easily diagnosed by identifying the changes in PMU data using Wavelet based signal processing techniques. A new software tool has been developed to detect the PMU signal variations and to classify the disturbances based on the signatures associated with each disturbance.

However, the large number of attributes of EEG data is regarded as a curse for classifiers. This paper aims at dimensionality reduction of EEG signals. We use rough set theory to reduce the dimensions of EEG data. In particular, we use discernibility matrix (DM) to compute an indispensable set of attributes of the data so that the attribute set is reduced before classification. We then use Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification of the EEG data containing only these attributes. We compare our method with the more popular Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We have used EEG dataset from BCI competition-II to perform the experiments. Accuracy, recall and precision are used as metrics to measure the performance of the classifiers with original dataset, PCA-reduced dataset and DM-reduced dataset. The classification results we obtained for the DM-reduced dataset are found to be as good as for the whole dataset without reduction and generally better than PCA-reduced dataset. © 2016 IEEE.",BCI; Dimensionality reduction; Discernibility matrix; EEG; ELM; PCA; SVM,Biomedical signal processing; Brain computer interface; Data reduction; Electroencephalography; Interfaces (computer); Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Principal component analysis; Rough set theory; Support vector machines; Attribute sets; Classification results; Dimensionality reduction; Discernibility matrix; EEG signals; Extreme learning machine; Naive bayes; Recall and precision; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015449239

As with any such set of data, efforts must be made to classify and categorize these files in order to facilitate easy access and searching. Songs can be classified based on attributes available in the music file's metadata such as artist, album, year of release, length, etc. However, if the similarity between two songs is to be determined, a simple comparison of metadata is not only unsatisfactory, the metadata itself might not be available. Therefore, a method of comparison independent of the availability of metadata is required.

In this paper, the main aim is to detect leukocytes from human blood. These leukocytes protect the body from infectious diseases. If there is any type of disturbances in the blood count, then it may signify the presence of some cancer. Due to this reason, earlier many hematological experts examined blood samples by using medical instruments such as flow cytometer, for determining what type of disease is present in the human body. Since, the manual segmentation remains a very soporific, tiresome and error prone job, experts preferred to use automatic systems that results in accurate segmentation of leukocytes, which is needed for their classification. In this paper, the simple thresholding technique is used for segmentation of leukocytes by using Otsu thresholding. After segmentation, mathematical morphing is used to remove all components those do not look like leukocytes. Further, only the nucleus region was considered for feature extraction. Thereafter, Naïve Bayes classification technique is used for classification of leukocytes. The results obtained are better than other state of art algorithms, the classification accuracy on the training dataset of only 20 images and test image dataset of 68 images is about 80.88%, in an average time of 22 s per image. © 2016 IEEE.",leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC); mathematical morphing; Naïve Bays classifier; segmentation,Blood; Diseases; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Sodium; Statistical tests; Automatic classification; Bayes classification; Classification accuracy; Medical instruments; Morphing; Morphological features; Thresholding techniques; White blood cells; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015416243

It's due to impairment of the arteries a veins located in the fundus of eye (retina) that are composed of light sensitive tissues. The aim of this research work is to design an efficient and sensitive tool for Diabetic Retinopathy using the images acquired from portable fundus camera. The screening tool is based on advanced machine learning and computer vision algorithm which includes patch level prediction. In patch level prediction algorithm will localize the diseased region in the Diabetic Retinopathy image like Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. The patch level classification uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning classifier model to predict the potential patch of Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. In this algorithm, the image is broken into regular rectangular patch. The feature for each patch along with the different class label based on the ground truth is computed and passed to strong classifier SVM. The data sets are split into training dataset and testing dataset. The classifier model is built on training dataset and tested against the test dataset.

Object recognition have immense of applications in the field of monitoring and surveillance, medical analysis, robot localization and navigation etc. The appearance of an object can be varied due to scene clutter, photometric effects, changes in shape and viewpoints of the object. The the recognition should be invariant to viewpoint changes and object transformations, robust to noise and occlusion. This work aims at formulating a technique that consist of two stages. For the first stage, the query image is categorized using a classifier. For classifier optimization we have implemented two types of classifiers- Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier that make use of GIST features and k-nearest neighbour(kNN) classifier that make use of Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT). GIST based SVM classification is done using different kernels such as Linear kernel, Polynomial kernel and Gaussian kernel. SIFT features are invariant to affine transformations of the images. SIFT features of the images are extracted and a similarity matrix is formed by matching these SIFT features. Then a k-nearest neighbour(kNN) classifier is implemented on the similarity matrix. GIST feature based SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel showed better classification accuracy than SIFT feature based kNN classifier.

Dimensionality reduction has an important role in hyperspectral image classification as it reduces redundancy by mapping the higher dimensional data into lower dimension without losing any valuable information in the spectral signature of each pixel. In this paper, dimensionality reduction is achieved by band partitioning and averaging, followed by classification using regularized least square(RLS) classifier. Adjacent bands in the hyperspectral image are partitioned into multiple subsets and then are combined together by averaging which follows transform domain recursive filtering for edge preservation. These dimensionality reduced, edge preserved images are classified using a RLS classifier. Our experimental results show that the proposed method has high accuracy, utilizes spectral and spatial information and is robust compared to other conventional classification techniques. © 2016 IEEE.",Band partitioning; Image fusion; RLS classifier; Transform domain recursive filtering,Classification (of information); Image fusion; Photomapping; Spectroscopy; Band partitioning; Classification technique; Dimensionality reduction; Edge preservations; Higher-dimensional; Recursive filtering; Regularized least squares; Spatial informations; Image classification,"Akhila, C.P.; Electronics and Communication Engineering, MES College of EngineeringIndia; email: akhilackv@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The commonly used pre-defined classes are the person name, place, name of organization, date, numericals, measurements, and so on.

The design is a kind of One-Against-All-Multi classification technique to solve the ambiguity caused by traditional SVM classifier. The system is based on contextual semantic rules and linguistic grammar rules.

We visualize the emotion recognition system as a noisy communication channel, thus motivating the use of ECC. We assume the emotion recognition process consists of an audio feature extractor followed by an artificial neural network (ANN) for emotion classification. In our formulation, the noise in the communication channel is a result of insufficiently learnt ANN classifier which results in an erroneous emotion classification. We first show that the ECC-ANN combination performs better than the ANN classifier, justifying the use of ECC-ANN combination. We further make the conjecture that ECC in ECC-ANN combination can be visualized as a part of Deep Neural Network (DNN) where the intelligence is under control. We show through rigorous experimentation, on Emo-DB database, that the use of ECC-ANN combination is equivalent to the DNN; in terms of the improved recognition accuracies over an ANN.

A scene/image classifier provides the first stage for this system. Scene classification is the process that analyzes the properties of various image features of a scene and organizes the scenes into categories. Programmed techniques for correlating scenes with labels have a high potential for improving the performance of computer vision applications such as searching, retrieval and object recognition. The scene category system uses the feature vectors extracted from image data to classify test images. We have implemented a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifier which uses gray scale and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features as input and used support vector machine (SVM) classifier that uses GIST features as input. kNN classifier is used, as it has an advantage of working with a large amount of data and SVM is robust even when the training sample has some bias. The performance measure of the classifier was evaluated using confusion matrix and classification accuracy. We considered MIT-8 scene category, leaves, Caltech-20 and deer data sets for our experiments. The classification accuracy was found to be good.

Fuzzy and fuzzy soft set approaches have been used successfully to deal with diverse uncertainties, imprecision and vagueness in data. We have advocated a method of fuzzy soft set using fuzzy soft aggregation operator for solving the problem. The proposed method includes five important stages namely pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction feature selection and classification. Preprocessing concentrates on the algorithmic development of automated noise removal, contrast enhancement and pectoral muscle removal. A hierarchical spatial fuzzy c- means clustering algorithm is employed for segmentation and the micro-calcification clusters have been identified with adaptive h-dome transformation. Among the various features present in the image, an initial set of 14 textural and statistical features are calculated from the micro-calcification clusters using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for 00 angle and 3 pixel distances. Out of 14 extracted features from the clusters, we have selected seven parameters for fuzzy soft set implementation. Using fuzzy aggregation operator, the classification process has been performed for malignant or normal cases. The experiment is performed with 322 images and resulted in 94.09% accuracy. Our method also benefited in dimensionality reduction with high accuracy and therefore the overall performance is improved. © 2016 IEEE.",Fuzzy aggregation operator; Fuzzy C- means clustering; Fuzzy soft set; Mammography; Statistical features,Biomineralization; Bone; Clustering algorithms; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Feature extraction; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Mammography; Mathematical operators; Set theory; X ray screens; Feature selection and classification; Fuzzy aggregation operators; Fuzzy C means clustering; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Fuzzy soft sets; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Soft aggregation operators; Statistical features; Classification (of information),"Sreedevi, S.; Dept. of Computer Science, University of KeralaIndia; email: sathyansree123@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

However, sEMG signals can be corrupted by muscular activity from multiple sources at the site of acquisition, and hence the identification of intents from these signals presents a challenge. Moreover, there can be multiple intents which need to be recognized, hence a robust classifier is required. The accurate recognition of these movements is imperative as it enables reliable control of devices. In this paper, we use the Twin Support Vector Machine (Twin SVM) classifier to identify 15 classes of wrist and finger flexions using one-v/s-rest classification approach. Our work uses sEMG data obtained from nine subjects, including an amputee volunteer. We compare the improved accuracy obtained in using Twin SVM against LIBSVM (a standard SVM implementation) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the classifier. We use a simple feature - the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the signal during the trial as features for the classifier.

Each algorithm is modelled based on different human expertises. However, the performance of conventional algorithms is not satisfactory to map especially the minerals in view of their typical spectral responses. This study introduces a new expert system named ‘EXhype (Expert system for hyperspectral data classification)’ to map minerals. The system incorporates human expertise at several stages of it's implementation: (i) to deal with intra-class variation; (ii) to identify absorption features; (iii) to discriminate spectra by considering absorption features, non-absorption features and by full spectra comparison; and (iv) finally takes a decision based on learning and by emphasizing most important features. It is developed using a knowledge base consisting of an Optimal Spectral Library, Segmented Upper Hull method, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Artificial Neural Network. The performance of the EXhype is compared with a traditional, most commonly used SAM algorithm using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired over Cuprite, Nevada, USA. A virtual verification method is used to collect samples information for accuracy assessment. Further, a modified accuracy assessment method is used to get a real users accuracies in cases where only limited or desired classes are considered for classification. With the modified accuracy assessment method, SAM and EXhype yields an overall accuracy of 60.35% and 90.75% and the kappa coefficient of 0.51 and 0.89 respectively. It was also found that the virtual verification method allows to use most desired stratified random sampling method and eliminates all the difficulties associated with it. The experimental results show that EXhype is not only producing better accuracy compared to traditional SAM but, can also rightly classify the minerals.

Articulatory features are more robust to noise and pronunciation variability compared to conventional acoustic features. To extract articulatory features, one method is to take conventional acoustic features like MFCC and build an articulatory classifier that would output articulatory features (known as pseudo-AF). However, these classifiers require a mapping from phone to different articulatory labels (AL) (e.g., place of articulation and manner of articulation), which is not readily available for many of the under-resourced languages. In this article, we have proposed an automated technique to generate phone-to-articulatory label (phone-to-AL) mapping for a new target language based on the knowledge of phone-to-AL mapping of a well-resourced language. The proposed mapping technique is based on the center-phone capturing property of interpolation vectors emerging from the recently proposed phone cluster adaptive training (Phone-CAT) method. Phone-CAT is an acoustic modeling technique that belongs to the broad category of canonical state models (CSM) that includes subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM). In Phone-CAT, the interpolation vector belonging to a particular context-dependent state has maximum weight for the center-phone in case of monophone clusters or by the AL of the center-phone in case of AL clusters. These relationships from the various context-dependent states are used to generate a phone-to-AL mapping. The Phone-CAT technique makes use of all the speech data belonging to a particular context-dependent state. Therefore, multiple segments of speech are used to generate the mapping, which makes it more robust to noise and other variations. In this study, we have obtained a phone-to-AL mapping for three under-resourced Indian languages namely Assamese, Hindi and Tamil based on the phone-to-AL mapping available for English. With the generated mappings, articulatory features are extracted for these languages using varying amounts of data in order to build an articulatory classifier. Experiments were also performed in a cross-lingual scenario assuming a small training data set (? 2 h) from each of the Indian languages with articulatory classifiers built using a lot of training data (? 22 h) from other languages including English (Switchboard task). Interestingly, cross-lingual performance is comparable to that of an articulatory classifier built with large amounts of native training data. Using articulatory features, more than 30% relative improvement was observed over the conventional MFCC features for all the three languages in a DNN framework. © 2016",Articulatory features; Cross-lingual techniques; Mapping; Multilayer perceptrons; Phone-CAT; Under-resourced languages,Acoustic noise; Aluminum; Classification (of information); Gaussian distribution; Interpolation; Mapping; Multilayer neural networks; Natural language processing systems; Speech recognition; Articulatory features; Automatic speech recognition; Cluster adaptive training; Cross-lingual; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Phone-CAT; Subspace Gaussian Mixture Models; Under-resourced languages; Telephone sets,"Abraham, B.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: ee11d032@ee.iitm.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1676393,,SCOMD,,English,Speech Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000963161

Most of the real-world networks are heterogeneous in their natural setting and traditional methods of classification for homogeneous networks are not suitable for heterogeneous networks. In a heterogeneous network, various meta-paths connecting objects of the target type, on which classification is to be performed, make the classification task more challenging. The semantic of each meta-path would lead to the different accuracy of classification. Therefore, weight learning of meta-paths is required to leverage their semantics simultaneously by a weighted combination. In this work, we propose a novel meta-path based framework, HeteClass, for transductive classification of target type objects. HeteClass explores the network schema of the given network and can also incorporate the knowledge of the domain expert to generate a set of meta-paths. The regularization based weight learning method proposed in HeteClass is effective to compute the weights of symmetric as well as asymmetric meta-paths in the network, and the weights generated are consistent with the real-world understanding. Using the learned weights, a homogeneous information network is formed on target type objects by the weighted combination, and transductive classification is performed.

Some of these diseases share a common characteristic, which makes the classification difficult.

With the popularity of Google Glass and GoPro, use of egocentric videos is on the rise. With the substantial increase in the number of egocentric videos, the value and utility of recognizing actions of the wearer in such videos has also thus increased. Unstructured movement of the camera due to natural head motion of the wearer causes sharp changes in the visual field of the egocentric camera causing many standard third person action recognition techniques to perform poorly on such videos. Objects present in the scene and hand gestures of the wearer are the most important cues for first person action recognition but are difficult to segment and recognize in an egocentric video. We propose a novel representation of the first person actions derived from feature trajectories. The features are simple to compute using standard point tracking and do not assume segmentation of hand/objects or recognizing object or hand pose unlike in many previous approaches. We train a bag of words classifier with the proposed features and report a performance improvement of more than 11% on publicly available datasets. Although not designed for the particular case, we show that our technique can also recognize wearer's actions when hands or objects are not visible. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Action and activity recognition; Egocentric vision; Video indexing and analysis; Video segmentation,Cameras; Classification (of information); Gesture recognition; Image recognition; Indexing (of information); Motion estimation; Action recognition; Activity recognition; Bag of words; First person; Point tracking; Video indexing; Video segmentation; Visual fields; Palmprint recognition,"Singh, S.; CVIT, IIIT HyderabadIndia; email: suriya.singh@research.iiit.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,313203,,PTNRA,,English,Pattern Recogn.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994766556

To get rid of this the most popular and useful approach is to follow reviews of others in opinionated social medias, who have already tried them. Almost all e-commerce sites provide facility to the users for giving views and experience of the product and services they experienced. The customers reviews are increasingly used by individuals, manufacturers and retailers for purchase and business decisions. As there is no scrutiny over the reviews received, anybody can write anything unanimously which conclusively leads to review spam. Moreover, driven by the desire of profit and/or publicity, spammers produce synthesized reviews to promote some products/brand and demote competitors products/brand. Deceptive review spam has seen a considerable growth overtime. In this work, we have applied supervised as well as unsupervised techniques to identify review spam. Most effective feature sets have been assembled for model building. Sentiment analysis has also been incorporated in the detection process. In order to get best performance some well-known classifiers were applied on labeled dataset. Further, for the unlabeled data, clustering is used after desired attributes were computed for spam detection. Additionally, there is a high chance that spam reviewers may also be held responsible for content pollution in multimedia social networks, because nowadays many users are giving the reviews using their social network logins. Finally, the work can be extended to find suspicious accounts responsible for posting fake multimedia contents into respective social networks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Opinion spam; Review analysis; Review spam; Sentiment analysis; Social networking; Spam detection techniques,Classification (of information); Commerce; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Sales; Social networking (online); Labeled and unlabeled data; Opinion spam; Product and services; Products and services; Review spam; Sentiment analysis; Spam detection; Unsupervised techniques; Internet,"Bakshi, S.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: sambitbaksi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982291336

Most of the state-of-the-art CBMIR systems suffer from various problems: computationally expensive due to the usage of high dimensional feature vectors and complex classifier/clustering schemes. Inability to properly handle the “semantic gap” and the high intra-class versus inter-class variability problem of the medical image database (like radiographic image database). This yields an exigent demand for developing highly effective and computationally efficient retrieval system. Methods We propose a novel interactive two-stage CBMIR system for diverse collection of medical radiographic images. Initially, Pulse Coupled Neural Network based shape features are used to find out the most probable (similar) image classes using a novel “similarity positional score” mechanism. This is followed by retrieval using Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform based texture features considering only the images of the pre-identified classes. Maximal information compression index is used for unsupervised feature selection to achieve better results. To reduce the semantic gap problem, the proposed system uses a novel fuzzy index based relevance feedback mechanism by incorporating subjectivity of human perception in an analytic manner. Results Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CBMIR system on a subset of Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA)-2009 database consisting of 10,902 labeled radiographic images of 57 different modalities. We obtained overall average precision of around 98% after only 2–3 iterations of relevance feedback mechanism. We assessed the results by comparisons with some of the state-of-the-art CBMIR systems for radiographic images. Conclusions Unlike most of the existing CBMIR systems, in the proposed two-stage hierarchical framework, main importance is given on constructing efficient and compact feature vector representation, search-space reduction and handling the “semantic gap” problem effectively, without compromising the retrieval performance. Experimental results and comparisons show that the proposed system performs efficiently in the radiographic medical image retrieval field. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Content based medical image retrieval; Fuzzy logic; Multiscale geometric analysis; Pulse couple neural network; Radiographic images; Relevance feedback,Classification (of information); Complex networks; Content based retrieval; Database systems; Diagnosis; Feedback control; Fuzzy logic; Hierarchical systems; Image enhancement; Image retrieval; Information retrieval; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Medical information systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Vector spaces; Content based medical image retrieval; Image retrieval in medical applications; Multi-scale geometric analysis; Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms; Radiographic images; Relevance feedback; Subjectivity of human perception; Unsupervised feature selection; Search engines; classifier; comparative effectiveness; compression; data base; diagnosis; experimental model; feedback system; fuzzy logic; human; image retrieval; nervous system; perception; quantitative study; visual information; fuzzy logic; information retrieval; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval,"Chowdhury, M.; Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical InstituteIndia; email: st.manishc@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28187892,English,Comput.

Further, whether this identification can be carried out by a single musical note, like humans are able to do, is an interesting research issue that has several potential applications in the music industry. Attempts have been made earlier using the spectral and temporal features of the music acoustic signals. The process of identifying the musical instrument from monophonic audio recording basically involves three steps - pre-processing of music signal, extracting features from it and then classifying those. In this paper, we present an experiment-based comparative study of different features for classifying few musical instruments. The acoustic features, namely, the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Spectral Centroids (SC), Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) and signal energy are derived from the music acoustic signal using different speech signal processing methods. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used with each feature for the relative comparisons. The classification results using different combinations of training by features from different music instrument and testing with another/same type of music instruments are compared. Our results indicate that the most significant feature for classifying Guitar, Violin and Drum is MFCC as it gives the better accurate results. Also, the feature which gives better accuracy results for the drum instrument is ZCR. Among the features used, after MFCC, ZCR proved to be the optimal feature for the classification of drum instrument. © 2016 IEEE.",autocorrelation; MFCC; monophonic; polyphonic; RMS; signal processing; spectral centroid; ZCR,Acoustic waves; Audio acoustics; Audio recordings; Autocorrelation; Classification (of information); Instrument testing; Musical instruments; Processing; Signal processing; Speech communication; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Classification results; Comparative studies; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; MFCC; monophonic; polyphonic; spectral centroid; Speech signal processing; Audio signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

People often ask others about the product before purchasing, otherwise see the reviews about the product in the different e-commerce sites and then come to conclusion whether to buy the product or not. This decision making process is very important before purchasing any product. But it is not easy to read all the reviews because one product may receive hundreds of reviews and if the product is popular then reviews can increase to thousands also. This is not only difficult for a customer to decide about a product, but also seller of the product to keep track of customer liking or disliking about the product. Opinion mining is used to analyze these online customer reviews. In this paper we are extracting reviews from different e-commerce sites and storing the reviews in MongoDB, one of the NoSQL database. From these review sentences, product features are extracted. The proposed method uses Apriori algorithm for feature extraction. The classification is done on product features based on unsupervised SentiWordNet method. In this method we are taking Adjective, Adverb, Verb, Noun as opinion words and negation rules are used for classification of reviews into positive and negative.

Out of various algorithms developed so far, Viola–Jones face detection has been highly successful. However, because of its complex nature, there is need to do more exploration in its various phases including training as well as actual face detection to find the scope of further improvement in terms of efficiency as well as accuracy under various constraints so as to detect and process the faces in real time. Its training phase for the screening of large amount of Haar features and generation of cascade classifiers is quite tedious and computationally intensive task. Any modification for improvement in its features or cascade classifiers requires re-training of all the features through example images, which are very large in number. Therefore, there is need to enhance the computational efficiency of training process of Viola–Jones face detection algorithm so that further enhancement in this framework is made easy. There are three main contributions in this research work. Firstly, we have achieved a considerable speedup by parallelizing the training as well as detection of rectangular Haar features based upon Viola–Jones framework on GPU. Secondly, the analysis of features selected through AdaBoost has been done, which can give intuitiveness in developing more innovative and efficient techniques for selecting competitive classifiers for the task of face detection, which can further be generalized for any type of object detection. Thirdly, implementation of parallelization techniques of modified version of Viola–Jones face detection algorithm in combination with skin color filtering to reduce the search space has been done. We have been able to achieve considerable reduction in the search space and time cost by using the skin color filtering in conjunction with the Viola–Jones algorithm. Time cost reduction of the order of 54.31% at the image resolution of 640*480 of GPU time versus CPU time has been achieved by the proposed parallelized algorithm. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",Face detection; Features analysis; GPU computing; Skin color filtering; Viola–Jones,Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Color; Computational efficiency; Cost reduction; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image resolution; Signal detection; Cascade classifiers; Face detection algorithm; Features analysis; GPU computing; Parallelization techniques; Parallelized algorithm; Research domains; Skin-color filtering; Face recognition,"Mutneja, V.; I.K.

In epileptic patients, the seizures affect Heart Rate Variability (HRV). This emphasizes the importance of autonomic function changes in diagnosing epilepsy. The present work proposes an algorithm that classifies a person as epileptic or nonepileptic using ECG signal. Time Domain Features (TDF) and Frequency Domain Features (FDF), derived from the R-R Intervals (RRI) of ECG signal are utilized. In addition, Statistical Features (SF) are derived from extracted TDF and FDF. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used to classify the ECG signal as epileptic or nonepileptic based on the extracted TDF, FDF and SF. The classification accuracy of the proposed method exhibits 97.5%. Analysis on clinical data shows that the proposed combination of TDF, FDF and statistical HRV features gives excellent classification accuracy. These results indicate that the proposed method can be applied to wearable heart rate measuring devices for diagnostic purpose. © 2016 IEEE.",biomedical signal processing; classification algorithm; epilepsy; feature extraction,Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Electrocardiography; Feature extraction; Frequency domain analysis; Heart; Neurology; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Time domain analysis; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification system; Electrocardiogram signal; epilepsy; Heart rate variability; Statistical features; Time domain features; Biomedical signal processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

The paper proposes a method of combining a series of Sparse Representation Classifier models using a network of Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVMs). One of the core ideas of the paper is that there exists a symbiosis between Sparse Representation Classifier and Linear Support Vector Machine. This symbiosis, we believe makes this ensemble of classifiers a very effective combination. This central argument of the paper is buttressed by empirical evidence, which displays the efficacy of the network of LSVMs in helping SRCs overcome their breakdown points. The paper discusses two important aspects of the ensembling framework: namely, diversity and percolation rate. Diversity is a measure of the ability of the series of SRCs to make uncorrelated errors, and percolation rate is the measure of the ability of the ensembling/combining scheme to pass the correct label as the final predicted label. The classification accuracy of the proposed ensembling framework compares favourably with traditional ensembling frameworks such as Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks on standard datasets. © 2016 IEEE.",Ensembling technique; Sparse Representation Classifier; Support Vector Machine,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Solvents; Vectors; Classification accuracy; Classifier models; Ensemble of classifiers; Ensembling technique; Linear Support Vector Machines; Percolation rates; Sparse representation; Uncorrelated errors; Support vector machines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Hyperspectral imaging collects information in the form of several hundreds of spectral bands with narrow bandwidths and provides full spectral information regarding the data. Hyperspectral image classification has been a vital topic which is growing rapidly in the field of research. Several applications can be built by making proper use of this data, i.e. from the abundance of spatial and spectral information which provides strong binding to build new ideas and new algorithm. Few approaches have concluded that the linear features directly extracted from hyperspectral data for classification provides distinct classification output and few other approaches conclude that the features selected using nonlinear features help to diminish dimensionality of the data, for better modelling of the intrinsic nonlinearity of classification. By combining the spectral features extracted using Root Mean Square (RMS) feature extraction technique and spatial features extracted using Extended Multi-Attribute Profile (EMAP) feature extraction technique we can get better classification output compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm utilizes both linear and nonlinear features along with a Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression (SMLR) classifier to provide a better classification. The developed algorithm is tested over four widely used hyper spectral data sets Hydice, Aviris Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. Test results obtained from the proposed work justify that the algorithm provides better and accurate Hyperspectral image classification. © 2016 IEEE.",Extended multi attribute morphological profile (EMAPs); Hyperspectral imaging; Linear and nonlinear features; Sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR),Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Hyperspectral imaging; Image classification; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Feature extraction algorithms; Feature extraction techniques; Morphological profile; Multinomial logistic regression; Non-linear transformations; Nonlinear features; Remote sensing technology; Spectral information; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent case now and it mostly affects the elderly people. The disease condition makes a person lose his memory and have trouble in doing his day-to-day activities, and progressively the condition leads to death. No treatment is available to completely cure the disease but it would be beneficial if the disease is detected earlier as the necessary aid can be provided. The proposed algorithm uses Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment non-convertible (MCInc) and Mild Cognitive Impairment convertible (MCIc) data from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and it involves the process of pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. MCIc leads to Alzheimer's disease at a later stage. A combination of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for the feature extraction and further subjected to classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Finally it attacks the tooth enamel causing gingivitis and other diseases if proper treatment is not given. Though there were dental plaque indices existing but they could not produce better results. The existing methodology mainly depends on the visual Capacity of the dentist to isolate or for revealing the areas of plaque.

The proposed methodology comprises of data pre-processing followed by application of data mining on the pre-processed data. The data pre-processing step involves conversion of Chinese to English, removal of html tags, removal of stop words and stemming. The feature vector to be provided for data mining is then formulated through the identified root words and the dictionary of terms from the WordNet-Affect. Since the dimensionality of the feature vector thus formed is very high, feature selection procedure is adopted to attain the most significant features. Various classification algorithms were attempted on the reduced feature set to classify the emotions as positive, negative, mixed or neutral.

Liver performs numerous metabolic functions that also enable smooth working of other organs. Any form of illness in liver leads to liver diseases. These diseases are of many types out of which the most commonly occurring are hepatitis A, B, C, D and E, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), liver fibrosis, liver tumor, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, fatty liver disease and autoimmune hepatitis. Presence of these diseases in various forms indicates the significance of accurate and timely diagnosis. This study accordingly aims to classify PBC stages using individual classifiers and hybrid models. Individual methods include linear discriminant analysis (LDA), diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA), euclidean distance based knearest neighbors (KNN), and hybrid models include combination of LDA, DLDA and KNN with dimensionality reduction method. Simulations results showed that hybrid frameworks outperform individual classifiers in terms of classification performance.

A high dimensional data consists of several features or attributes. These data may contain redundant and irrelevant features. The curse of dimensionality is an important problem in data mining and machine learning. In order to reduce the dimensionality of data and to improve the classifier performance, the unwanted and redundant features need to be removed. Feature selection techniques are used to identify the redundant and irrelevant features from the original set of data. Feature selection is the process of identifying most representative features from a collection of features. Existing feature selection algorithms like FAST, reduces dimensionality by removing irrelevant and redundant features from a collection of data and selects the required subset of features. The FAST algorithm uses information gain to calculate the symmetric uncertainty which is used as the measure of correlation between features. Information gain will check for only the presence of a feature with respect to another feature or class. But this will not give an accurate result. Thus the accuracy of results produced from the FAST algorithm is low. So a new Binary Krill Herd (BKH) algorithm is introduced for feature selection, in which a classifier is used as the objective function. BKH is a biological algorithm based on the movement of krill individuals. A binary vector is used to determine whether or not a feature will be selected, where 1 denotes whether a feature will be selected and 0 otherwise. The algorithm is evaluated a number of times with respect to the changes in the number of iterations per run, population size, problem dimension, and number of runs. The Binary Krill Herd algorithm not only considers the presence but also the change of a feature with respect to another or class. This helps to identify strongly correlated features compared to FAST algorithm. The proposed BKH algorithm has been compared against with FAST algorithm using several datasets. The datasets are derived from UCI machine learning repository. For the validation of the new algorithm, the classification accuracy is tested against several classifiers, mainly J48, Naive Bayes, Decision tree etc. The experimental result shows that the BKH algorithm for feature selection achieves more reduction in dimensionality by selecting only a small portion of the original features and outperforms FAST algorithms by producing more accurate results in less time. © 2016 IEEE.",Dimensionality reduction; Feature clustering; Feature subset selection; Krill; Symmetric uncertainty,Artificial intelligence; Bins; Bioinformatics; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Population statistics; Trees (mathematics); Dimensionality reduction; Feature clustering; Feature subset selection; Krill; Symmetric uncertainty; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The fMRI reveals the functional activity caused by the Blood Oxygenated Level Dependent (BOLD) signals in the brain. The visual image reconstruction allows to translate neural brain activity pattern into the visual image (stimulus) that has caused the corresponding brain activity. The stimulus may be graphical characters, face images, handwritten characters and natural images. The proposed technique aims to develop a novel framework for visual image reconstruction of natural images from fMRI. The exact reconstruction of natural images is challenging due to its complexity. The classification of image prior plays an important role in improving the accuracy of reconstruction. Since the image prior consists of multiple categories, like Gabor wavelet transform, Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Haar feature transform, Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) were tried on image prior. The extracted features are fed into the multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier followed by k-means clustering. An analysis on reconstruction done using different feature extraction techniques revealed that the Gabor feature extraction gave the highest accuracy in final results. The reconstruction of natural images was achieved with an accuracy of 80% till now. Also 70% accuracy was achieved in identifying the category and reconstructing the test stimulus from a real time test fMRI voxel responses.

The main reason for the low quality of data is the presence of noise and also the redundant data. Noise in this perspective is nothing but the meaningless data that are in the data sets.

Businesses (or similar entities) need to identify the polarity of these opinions in order to understand user orientation and thereby make smarter decisions. One such application is in the field of politics, where political entities need to understand public opinion and thus determine their campaigning strategy. Sentiment analysis on social media data has been seen by many as an effective tool to monitor user preferences and inclination. Popular text classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM are Supervised Learning Algorithms which require a training data set to perform Sentiment analysis. The accuracy of these algorithms is contingent upon the quantity as well as the quality (features and contextual relevance) of the labeled training data. Since most applications suffer from lack of training data, they resort to cross domain sentiment analysis which misses out on features relevant to the target data. This, in turn, takes a toll on the overall accuracy of text classification. In this paper, we propose a two stage framework which can be used to create a training data from the mined Twitter data without compromising on features and contextual relevance. Finally, we propose a scalable machine learning model to predict the election results using our two stage framework.",Labeling; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Training data; Twitter; Vader,Data mining; Labeling; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Text processing; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Training data; Twitter; Vader; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

A total of 214 million cases of malaria are encountered annually. The conventional method for testing malaria is through microscopy. A blood sample of the patient is spread over a glass slide, stained with Giemsa stain and examined under a microscope. It takes a few hours and a highly trained professional to visually examine the slide and give the results. It is even more difficult to detect the different types of malaria parasite and their stages by the conventional methods. The proposed method involves acquisition of the thin blood smear microscopic image at 100x magnification, pre-processing by partial contrast stretching, separation of infected cell from the image by applying k-means clustering on the a?b component of L?a?b color space, feature extraction (shape and textural) of the infected cell, feature reduction using one way ANOVA and finally training the K-nearest neighbor classifier to test the images. Instead of extracting features for the entire group of erythrocytes present in the image, the algorithm only processes the infected cells increasing the speed, effectiveness and efficiency of testing.

This information can be used in various constructive fields only if we are able to handle big data efficiently. One such process that is used to extract and handle the hidden information is data mining. There are various techniques in data mining namely Clustering, Prediction, Classification, Association etc. Clustering is dividing data set into related groups such that all the groups do not have anything in common. Prediction, as the name suggests, predictions are made with available data set. It does not give surety of any kind, it may predict right or may predict wrong. Classification is classification of data sets into some predefined sets using various mathematical models. Association is discovering a correlation hidden in large amount of data, that is, in a given transaction based on the relationships between the items a pattern is discovered. In this paper we study one of the most widely used methods to handle big data, that is, data mining clustering algorithms.

In this work, signals are uniformly decomposed to form a set of uniform matrices. Then using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) each pair matrices are mapped to orthogonal space. Next, Wavelet transformation is performed on original feature matrices and then mapped to orthogonal space. Both domains are statistically independent. From each domain, same dimensional feature vectors are extracted and concatenated them to form single embedding vectors. The embedding vectors are fed to classifier to recognize the healthy control and pathological signal patterns. For demonstration, we consider three groups of EMG signal vis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Myopathy (Myo) and healthy control (Nor). Results indicate that adopted feature extraction technique and synchronization of features strongly enhances the quality of feature pattern. The optimum recognition rate under adopted feature technique are obtained 95.91%±3.6% and 95.58%±1.5 % in Myo-Nor and ALS-Nor respectively. The proposed feature extraction scheme is consistent not only in accuracies but also other quality assessment parameters. Hence it promises to provide a better strategic tool for signal classification. © 2016 IEEE.",Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Motor unit action potential and electromyography (EMG),Bioelectric phenomena; Classification (of information); Correlation methods; Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Signal processing; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Biomedical signal; Canonical correlation analysis; Feature extraction techniques; Motor unit action potentials; Quality assessment; Signal classification; Wavelet transformations; Biomedical signal processing,"Hazarika, A.; Department of ECE, Tezpur UniversityIndia; email: anilhazarika8@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The new way of cybercrime is introduced by hackers in online social networks (OSNs). Hackers identified various ideas to damage the computer systems and methods to forward spam messages for advertisement purpose in illegal way. As popularity of third-party apps platform and deploying malicious applications increases so hackers have started taking advantages. Online social media is considered as a rich source of information as it provides the good quality content; however consumption of poor quality content can degrade user experience, and have unsuitable impact in the real world. In this paper we proposed system which develop tool that can predict malicious application with better results as compare to existing system. Proposed system implements the classification technique. This technique is used for identifying malicious app. System added parameters like number of user rating and user review to generate better results. That is user rating and Description Content check-up. Every app has few reviews as a feedback from user side, and we consider user mention all related to that app which is as per its experience. We consider all that reviews for checking app is malicious or benign. Existing system says that malicious app doesn't give any description but what about such malicious app which gives description and such benign app which doesn't give description...? Its completely opposite of accuracy result. So in this paper we consider these two points as new feature of FRAppE for improving result accuracy.

Fixing of bugs detected in one clone require detection of all clones. Hence, it is imperative to identify and remove all code clones in a program. The focus of previous research work on the code clone detection was to find identical clones, or clones that are identical up to identifiers and literal values. But, detection of similar clones is often important. In the present paper it is proposed to generate the feature sets after parsing the given C program for code fragments and then match their similarity. On the basis of feature sets the classification of algorithm is being performed by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a machine learning tool. The output of the machine tool would be the similarity ratio with which the two C programs are related to each other and also the class in which they would occur.

Attempt should be made to detect it an early stage so that it may be controlled and sometimes cured. But this requires proper diagnosing methods so that the demerits and pains of being diagnosed are minimized among patients. With respect to these recent day diagnosis that are leaning towards the non-invasiveness associating the Computer-Aided technologies, bringing many benefits to this specific area of Medical field, we have tried to propose a methodology which will remove the manual interpretation of detecting the affected regions from an image generated from a modern and new diagnosing modality named Sonoelastography(SE). SE images marks regions in the form of color coded patches depending on the Elasticity scores in a particular Region of Interest (RoI). Here we have tried to analyze such images and classify an image that whether it is malignant or not. We have taken color SE images as our principle input to the proposed system. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to identify the most relevant sections of the image after the preprocessing step(s), where generation of two separate images containing the affected regions and the unaffected regions are carried out. Multilevel thresholding has been used to generate the affected and unaffected images from the original image. The images after thresholding are channeled to red and blue components and are applied to DWT from where the Low Low (LL) component is subjected to obtain features which are used finally to classify the images using Back Propagation Neural Network. © 2016 IEEE.",Classification; Discrete Wavelet Transform; Elasticity Score; Neural Network; Sonoelastography; Supervised Learning; Thresholding,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Diseases; Elasticity; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Torsional stress; Wavelet transforms; Back propagation neural networks; Computer aided technologies; Detection and identifications; Multilevel thresholding; Pre-processing step; Region of interest; Sonoelastography; Thresholding; Image classification,,Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

On time flight arrivals and departures are dependent on various factors including airport characteristics like the number of flights handled, ground handler's efficiency, disruptions caused by weather conditions, security alerts, queue times at immigration and air traffic congestion. There is a direct causation based relationship on delays, cancellations, re-schedule at the airport with passenger complaints and churn. Airports and airlines can infer signals of passenger satisfaction with the relevant events associated with on-Time performance and delays. Hub airports deal with high passenger traffic, connections and operational complexities hence they are good candidates for passenger service studies. In this paper, we had collected datasets for on-Time performance, flights for 48 global hub airports and passenger reviews about queue time. Further, we applied Logistic Model Trees (LMT) machine learning method for predicting the level of passenger satisfaction based on factors like an airport on time performance, the number of flights, on-Time ranking, average delays and queue time.

Electronic nose detects tea samples on the basis of aroma and taste can be detected by electronic tongue. But to develop human like quality judgment system, both the sensor responses must be considered. The objective of this work is to find optimized dataset by combining the sensor responses of e-nose and e-tongue so that the improved classification of tea can be done. Like individual sensor systems the merged sensor response should be preprocessed with suitable preprocessing method before feeding the data set to the classifier. In order to find the optimized dataset from both the systems, several multivariate preprocessing techniques are explored in this study. The quantitative measurements of preprocessing techniques applied to individual sensor system as well as fused dataset are estimated first with cluster separability measure (SI) and Dunn index (DI) calculation. Then each preprocessed dataset are tested with neural network based classifier. For getting optimized merged sensor response two methods of data merging have been attempted in this work. One by directly merging the raw sensor responses and then tested with preprocessing techniques and another is to find the optimized response from individual sensor systems and then to merge those optimized responses. The results show that the second method of fusion gives much better performance than direct merging of sensor responses. © 2016 IEEE.",Data-preprocessing; Dunn's Index; E-Nose; E-Tongue; Neural Network,Classification (of information); Electronic tongues; Merging; Neural networks; Data preprocessing; Dunn's Index; Pre-processing method; Preprocessing techniques; Quality estimation; Quantitative measurement; Sensor response; Separability measure; Electronic nose,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Classifiers provide poor performance when such dataset are feed into it for categorization due to their high dimension. The most important attributes are extracted from the dataset prior to classification for efficient classifier design. It is also true that there may be many classifiers of a particular system, some provide better accuracy than others but selection of single classifier with all its optimized parameters is always not a good choice for various real world applications. The paper proposes a novel method for construction of an ensemble classifier by combining multiple classifiers obtained using Rough Set Theory and Genetic algorithm. The method selects the classifiers for integration based on accuracy and develops an efficient and effective ensemble classification system. In the first phase of the work, rule based classifiers termed as base classifiers are constructed from the reduced information sub systems obtained using Rough Set Theory, where a set of high quality rules are generated for each sub system. In the second phase, base classifiers are combined and an optimal ensemble classification system is developed using Genetic Algorithm. Here, ensemble classifier takes an important role to discover the class labels of the test objects with higher accuracy. The proposed algorithm has been run on standard benchmark dataset collected from the UCI repository. © 2016 IEEE.",Classification System; Dimension Reduction; Ensemble classifiers; Genetic Algorithm; Rough Set Theory,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Genetic algorithms; Rough set theory; Set theory; Benchmark datasets; Classification system; Dimension reduction; Ensemble classification; Ensemble classifiers; Multiple classifiers; Optimized parameter; Rule-based classifier; Classification (of information),,Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

This paper proposes an approach for identifying tampered information by analyzing the spatial distribution of DCT coefficients in a new way for classifying caption and scene text. Since caption text is edited/superimposed, which results in artificially created texts comparing to scene texts that exist naturally in frames. We exploit this fact to identify the presence of caption and scene texts in video frames based on the advantage of DCT coefficients. The proposed method analyzes the distributions of both zero and non-zero coefficients (only positive values) locally by moving a window, and studies histogram operations over each input text line image. This generates line graphs for respective zero and non-zero coefficient coordinates. We further study the behavior of text lines, namely, linearity and smoothness based on centroid location analysis, and the principal axis direction of each text line for classification.

It can be characterized by the gradual loss of articular cartilage. The knee OA- Affected bones slide together due to degradation of cartilage, causing joint pain, swelling, stiffness and eventual loss of motion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable non-invasive imaging modality to detect damages in cartilage, ligament and tendon which cannot be visualized using an x-ray. In the proposed work, the cartilage is segmented using pixel-based segmentation technique. Image processing techniques such as contrast enhancement, histogram equalization, thresholding and canny edge detection are implementedusing MATLAB R2013a (8.1) software on the MR images in 2D coronal view. Then a rough mask is created which undergoes morphological operations and the background noise is reduced. The segmented image undergoes GLCM feature extraction process. The texture features are calculated from the segmented image. The extracted GLCM features are given to the SVM classifier for classifying the image as normal and OA-affected.

The HEVC is latest video compression standard and has incorporated many improvements like bitrate reduction, increased coding efficiency and compression efficiency but at the cost of increased complexity. The complexity of H.265 is increased due to Motion Estimation (ME), as it consumes almost half time of total time. Motion Estimation algorithm used in reference software code is robust and it is independent of motion information of videos. Real world video sequences show a wide range of motion related information which varies from uniform to random. If the motion characteristics of video sequences are taken into account earlier, it is possible to develop a fast motion estimation algorithm for video sequences. The proposed algorithm includes motion vector prediction which uses motion data of neighboring candidates and motion classification using the characteristics of video sequences. Based on the type of motion the algorithm chooses between different search patterns to enhance the matching process. Early termination helps to additional speedup and improves the process.

Overall accuracy (OA), Kappa Index Analysis (KIA), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision (P) have been considered as evaluation parameters in order to assess the predictive accuracy of SVM. Both high resolution QuickBird sensor data and moderate resolution Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) remotely sensed satellite data have been used in the investigation. It was observed that SVM with polynomial kernel (SVMP) achieves highest classification accuracy followed by SVM with linear kernel (SVML), SVM with RBF kernel (SVMRBF) and SVM with sigmoid kernel (SVML) while classifying QuickBird data. On the other hand, SVMS achieves highest accuracy followed by SVML, SVMP and SVMRBF in case of Landsat ETM+ data. However, faces SVMS lots of computational expenses in classifying both QuickBird and Landsat ETM+ data as compared to the SVMs with other three kernels.

For this to happen, it is crucial to monitor the crops throughout their growth period. In this paper, Image processing is used to detect and classify sunflower crop diseases based on the image of their leaf. The images are taken through a high resolution digital camera and after preprocessing, are subjected to k-means clustering to get the diseased part of the leaf. These are then run through the various machine learning algorithms and classified based on their color and texture features. A comparison based on accuracy between various machine learning algorithms is done namely K-Nearest Neighbors, Multi-Class Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Multinomial Logistic Regression to achieve maximum accuracy. The implementation has been done using MATLAB. © 2016 IEEE.",Classification; K-nearest neighbors; Logistic regression; Naive bayes; SVM,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Crops; Image processing; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Agriculture sectors; Color and texture features; High-resolution digital cameras; K-nearest neighbors; Logistic regressions; Multi-class support vector machines; Multinomial logistic regression; Naive bayes; Learning algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

A local binary texture method, as a statistical approach, and a wavelet analysis technique, as a transform-based approach, are used for feature extraction and two feature vectors are obtained for every document image. The similarity distances between each of the two feature vectors extracted for a given query and the feature vectors extracted from the document images in the training step are computed separately. In order to use the properties of both features, a classifier fusion technique is then employed using a weighted average fusion of distance measures obtained in relation to each feature vector. The document images are finally ranked based on the greatest visual similarity to the query obtained from the fusion similarity measures. The Media Team Document Database, which provides a great variety of page layouts and contents, is considered for evaluating the proposed method.

Twitter is a widely used social site to express opinion and feelings related to any domain. Tweets can be used to extract relevant and reliable information. Data analysis is an important task for mining these types of large data. The classification of these tweets can be useful to human beings. However, storage and processing of plenty of tweets is a challenging problem. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) can be used to store this data. To extract information and to classify tweets, various data mining techniques can be utilized. The well-known data mining techniques include Clustering and Classification. Traditionally, these algorithms run in the sequential environment. For improving computational performance and address scalability issue, these methods should run in distributed environment. However, distributed environment introduces issues like synchronization, communication overhead, appropriate division of tasks/data, and load imbalance. The problem of synchronization can be handled using Hadoop Map-reduce programming model.

It helps law enforcement authorities in searching particular criminal from their previous record. It has been reported that searching a criminal record manually requires too much time to get the accurate result. We have proposed a query-based approach which minimises the computational cost along with the reduction of search space. A symbolic database has been created to perform a stringent analysis on 150 public (Bollywood celebrities and Indian cricketers) and 90 local faces (our data-set). An expert knowledge has been captured to encapsulate every criminal’s anatomical and facial attributes in the form of symbolic representation. A fast query-based searching strategy has been implemented using dynamic decision tree data structure which allows four levels of decomposition to fetch respective criminal records. Two types of case studies - viewed and forensic sketches have been considered to evaluate the strength of our proposed approach. We have derived 1200 views of the entire population by taking into consideration 80 participants as eyewitness. The system demonstrates an accuracy level of 98.6% for test case I and 97.8% for test case II. It has also been reported that experimental results reduce the search space up to 30 most relevant records. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.,classification; Criminal identification; dynamic query optimisation; expert system; knowledge extraction; knowledge representation; reasoning,Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Expert systems; Knowledge representation; Query processing; Trees (mathematics); Vision; Computational costs; Dynamic Query; Enforcement authorities; Knowledge extraction; reasoning; Searching strategy; Symbolic representation; Tree data structures; Crime,"Singh, A.K.; Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Indian Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: rs110@iiita.ac.in",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,0952813X,,,,English,J.

Earlier works did not concentrate on both fault management and loss recovery issues. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a reliable data aggregation scheme is proposed that uses support vector machine (SVM) for performing failure detection and loss recovery. Initially, a group head, selected based on node connectivity, splits the nodes into clusters based on their location information. In each cluster, the cluster member with maximum node connectivity is chosen as the cluster head. When the aggregator receives data from the source, it identifies node failures in the received data by classifying the faulty data using SVM. Furthermore, a reserve node-based fault recovery mechanism is developed to prevent data loss. Through simulations, we show that the proposed technique minimises the transmission overhead and increases reliability. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Data aggregation; sensor nodes; support vector machine; wireless sensor network,Classification (of information); Computer system recovery; Recovery; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Data aggregation; Failure detection; Fault management; Faultrecovery mechanisms; Location information; Node connectivity; Reliable data aggregation; Transmission overheads; Sensor nodes,"Kamalesh, S.; Information Technology, Anna UniversityIndia; email: skl@vcet.ac.in",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,0952813X,,,,English,J.

For further processing, lower half section of vehicle image has been cropped of sized (450 × 140) while tracking. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and histogram matching technique are used to detect license plate. Due to the robustness of LBP features, this method can adaptively deal with various changes such as rotation, scaling, and illumination in the license plate. Segmentation of the plate region into disjoint characters has been done with bounding box technique with some modifications. Recognition has been done by calculating histogram features.

The diagnostic accuracy can be limited by incompetence of the operating personnel, which can be supplemented by machine learning algorithms for classification of physiology and pathology. This paper uses effective information feature extraction, principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of multi-sequence MR images of 7 patients. All axial slices of the brain are classified into normal and abnormal images. Various methods for feature extraction were tested among which effective information yielded the highest accuracy of 80.8 in a set of 677 images used for training and testing. The sensitivity and specificity were 80 and 81.06, respectively. Different grid sizes were tested, and the highest accuracy was reported for 2 × 2 which indicates that the feature extraction must be taken over a small grid to ensure detection of minor variation from normal. The image sequences tested considered in the study are T1 weighted, T2 weighted, Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and post contrast T1 weighted. T2 weighted images were best classified with the maximum accuracy of 95.97. This method proved to be effective to classify the images of all four sequences with accuracy ranging from 92-96. The method was also tested with out of sample data and the accuracy obtained was 72.4. The novelty of this work lies in the classification of multi-sequential images using all the different slices of the patient which includes the top of the skull as well as the mandible. The slices differ significantly as the spread of the tumor varies with each slice. The slices are taken at 5mm gap and the tumor can have a thickness less or more than the slice gap considered for the scan. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

A hardware implementation was also demonstrated using a 2-array scheme with a cross-bar of memristors with asynchronous signals to show software equivalent performance [2]. Both learning and recognition (testing) were done with spiking neurons. However, simulating the neural dynamics for testing is computationally expensive which translated to high energy consumption in hardware. Also, the output is only a digital decision, namely the predicted class, which does not reflect the confidence of the decision. In this paper, we present a methodology for a quick and efficient performance evaluation - based on a DC analysis scheme termed as “Current Space” method implemented in hardware with a cross bar array. Here the input neurons produce analog dc voltage inputs for the crossbar array with learnt resistances (weights) to produce analog current levels at the output neurons. The relative current levels provide an analog measure of the decision i.e. extent of separation of classes (i.e. robustness) in the current space of the different output neurons as opposed to a digital decision based on vigorous vs. no spiking in the SNN network. This output signal is essentially equivalent to a software dot-product of input signals with the learnt weight matrix, as is done for ANNs. This method accurately reflects the classification accuracy of SNNs (correlation of 0.98). It enables fast testing (i.e. 15000× faster) in software which translates to a 25× energy reduction for recognition in hardware by our method compared to SNN based recognition. We show that robustness metric can be used to evaluate noise tolerance in the network to produce a training completion criterion based on immunity to noise. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Crossbar arrays; Neural networks; Noise-tolerance; Recognition; Robustness; Spiking; Supervised hebbian learning; Two-layer networks,Classification (of information); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Learning systems; Network layers; Neurons; Robustness (control systems); Software testing; Crossbar arrays; Hebbian learning; Noise tolerance; Recognition; Spiking; Two-layer network; Neural networks,"Prasad, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology BombayIndia; email: sidharth52@gmail.com",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

We take a fundamentally new approach in exploiting the class imbalance through a feature transformation such that the transformed features are easier to classify. Hypothesis testing is used for classification with a test statistic that follows the distribution of the difference of two ?2 random variables, for which there are no analytic expressions and we derive an accurate approximation.

The gain ratio is normalized information gain of attributes and is not biased toward multi-valued attributes. In addition, the proposed approach computes the fitness of individuals from a pre-computed matrix of posterior probabilities using Bayesian framework instead of making repeated training database scans. This approach for fitness computation increases the efficiency of the proposed GA by eliminating a large number of database scans.

Association rule mining (ARM) is one of the techniques in data processing with the two sub processes. One is identifying frequent itemsets and the other is association rule mining. Frequent itemset mining has developed as a major issue in data mining and assumes an essential part in various data mining tasks, for example, association analysis, classification, etc. In the structure of frequent itemset mining, the outcomes are itemsets which are frequent in the entire database. Association rule mining is a basic data mining task. Researchers developed many algorithms for finding frequent itemsets and association rules. However, relying upon the choice of the thresholds, present algorithms become very slow and produce a greatly large amount of outcomes or generates few outcomes, omitting usable information. Furthermore, it is well-known that an expansive extent of association rules produced is redundant. This is truly a significant issue because in practice users don’t have much asset for analyzing the outcomes and need to find a certain amount of outcomes within a limited time. To address this issue, we propose a one of a kind algorithm called top-k association rules (TKAR) to mine top positioned data from a data set. The proposed algorithm uses a novel technique for generating association rules.

It is one of the fields which is steadfastly growing in medical imaging, providing advances in ultrasound imaging technology. However, nerve identification continues to remain as one of the most challenging tasks that anesthetists can encounter in the UGRA technique of injection. One of the main reasons of this include the low quality of the ultrasound images which are affected by the introduction of unwanted speckle noise. Since, Regional anesthesia (RA) is one of most frequently undertaken tasks in hospitals throughout the world to reduce or nullify the effect of the persistent pain in patients, any discrepancy in providing anesthesia can lead to severe damage to the respective region of the body or side effects to the rest of the body and also to the life of the patient. This enhances the need for correctly identifying the right nerve region to provide anesthesia. In this paper, we survey the conventional methods [1] used in biomedical image processing. For each stage of the processing, we have performed comparison with the different methodologies and we propose a combination of the methods which gives the best performance. © 2017 IEEE.",Anesthesia; Classification; Deep Learning Architecture; Despeckling Filter; Feature extraction; Feature Selection,Anesthesiology; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Ultrasonic imaging; Anesthesia; Conventional methods; De-speckling; Learning architectures; Nerve segmentations; Ultrasound guided; Ultrasound images; Ultrasound imaging; Medical imaging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,English,"Proc.

A quality assessment technique along with fingerprint quality score will enable AFIS system to make appropriate decision regarding rejecting the low quality image and recapture a better quality fingerprint image. In this paper, we propose an effective method for evaluating fingerprint image quality (dry, normal dry, good, normal wet and wet) on a local level (block-wise). Feature vector for evaluating fingerprint quality covers moisture, mean, variance, ridge valley area uniformity and ridge line count. Block-wise quality label is assigned through pattern classification based on these features. In addition to quality labels, our proposed method also provides a quality score for a fingerprint image. Manually labeled dry, normal dry, good, normal wet and wet quality blocks of FVC 2004 DB1 _a dataset is used to create a classification model using decision tree classifier. Block classification accuracy of 95.20% is achieved. Further, the same classification model is utilized to compute overall quality score of a fingerprint image.

For multi-label datasets, the positive and negative class memberships for the instance set vary from label to label. In such a scenario, a dedicated feature set for each label can serve better than a single feature set for all labels. In this article, we approach multi-label learning addressing the same concern and present our work Multi-label learning through Minimum Spanning Tree based subset selection and feature extraction (MuMST-FE). For each label, we estimate the positive and negative class shapes using respective Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs), followed by subset selection based on the key lattices of the MSTs. We select a unique subset of instances for each label which participates in the feature extraction step. A distance based feature set is extracted for each label from the reduced instance set to facilitate final classification.

With the increase in digital data sharing, data breaches have also increased significantly resulting in sensitive information being accessed by unintended recipients. To protect documents against such unauthorized access, the documents are assigned a security policy which is a set of users and information about their access permissions on the document. With the surge in the volume of digital documents, manual assignment of security policies is infeasible and error prone calling for an automatic policy assignment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that analyzes the sensitive information and historic access permissions to identify content-access correspondence via a novel multi-label classifier formulation.

A dataset is said to be imbalance, if categories of the classification attribute is not evenly represented. A fine balanced dataset is an important source for the classifiers to define the best prediction model. All the existing classifiers are inclined to perform poor on the imbalanced datasets. The reason for this is, all the classifiers seek to optimize their overall accuracy not by considering the relative distribution of each class. Hence, it is very essential to go for well balanced dataset for classification. In this paper, the comprehensive Enhanced Minority Oversampling TEchnique (EMOTE) is proposed to improve the performance of the classifier by balancing the dataset. The key idea of the proposed method is to balance the dataset by tuning the misclassified instances of the minority classes into correctly classified instances through oversampling their nearest neighbor. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, different oversampling and under sampling methods inclusive of the well known method SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique) are considered. Various imbalanced datasets from the UCI machine learning repository are considered for experiments The experimental results shows that, the proposed method EMOTE outperformed the other methods in balancing the dataset. In addition to this it is also proved that, the classifier is able to effectively improve its performance on the dataset which is generated by EMOTE. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Detailed LULC classification requires both high spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral remote sensing or imaging spectroscopy captures information in a large number of contiguous bands for each pixel in an image. High resolution hyperspectral data, rich in both contextual and spectral information, can be used to generate detailed information about various materials and entities on the Earth's surface. Traditional pixel-based classifiers fail to distinguish between different features such as building roof types or vegetation species owing to similarity of spectral signatures leading to merging of classes. This difficulty is overcome by object based classification approach which divides the image into several homogenous objects considering the textural and spatial properties along with spectral characteristics thereby yielding a more effective, efficient and accurate classification of surface features. This study assesses the potential of airborne hyperspectral data for LULC information extraction using pixel based and object-based approaches. Preprocessing steps included geometric correction of surface reflectance image following which noisy bands were removed. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used for pixel based classification while multi-resolution segmentation followed by hierarchical classification using nearest neighbor algorithm has been adopted for object based approach. Ten target classes were taken and the results for both approaches have been compared using confusion matrix parameters and Pearson's Kappa Coefficient. It was found that object based image analysis gave better classification results in comparison to SAM and SVM.

The proposed model makes use of global features of logo images such as color, texture, and shape features for classification. The logo images are broadly classified into three different classes, viz., logo image containing only text, an image with only symbol, and an image with both text and a symbol. In each class, the similar looking logo images are clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The intra-cluster variations present in each cluster corresponding to each class are then preserved using symbolic interval data. Thus referenced logo images are represented in the form of interval data. A sample logo image is then classified using suitable symbolic classifier. For experimentation purpose, relatively large amount of color logo images is created consisting of 5044 logo images. The classification results are validated with the help of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and time. To check the efficacy of the proposed model, the comparative analyses are given against the other models. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the other models with respect to time and F-measure. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Appearance-based features; Clustering; Logo image classification; Symbolic classification; Symbolic representation,Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Computer vision; Image processing; Appearance based; Classification results; Clustering; Comparative analysis; Different class; K-Means clustering algorithm; Symbolic classifications; Symbolic representation; Image classification,"Vinay Kumar, N.; Department of Studies in Computer Science, University of Mysore ManasagangotriIndia; email: vinaykumar.natraj@gmail.com",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The proposed approach takes care of selecting the class specific features through interval K-Means clustering. The kernel of K-Means clustering algorithm is modified to adapt interval valued data. During training, a set of samples corresponding to a class is fed into the interval K-Means clustering algorithm, which clusters features into K distinct clusters. Hence, there are K number of features corresponding to each class. Subsequently, corresponding to each class, the cluster representatives are chosen. This procedure is repeated for all the samples of remaining classes. During testing the feature indices correspond to each class are used for validating the given dataset through classification using suitable symbolic classifiers. For experimentation, four standard supervised interval datasets are used. The results show the superiority of the proposed model when compared with the other existing state-of-the-art feature selection methods. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Feature selection; Interval data; Symbolic classification; Symbolic similarity measure,Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Statistical tests; Class specific features; Feature selection methods; Interval data; Interval-valued data; K-means clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; Symbolic classifications; Symbolic similarity; Clustering algorithms,"Vinay Kumar, N.; Department of Studies in Computer Science, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, India; email: vinaykumar.natraj@gmail.com",Hangarge M.Negi A.Bevilacqua V.Santosh K.C.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

Remote sensing and Geo-ICT tools offer a simple, fast, efficient and cost-effective method of not just updating the horticulture crop inventory but also integrating the database, thus making it conducive for easy retrieval, analysis and decision-making. Medium and high resolution remote sensing data like LISS-IV and PAN prove to be effective in inventorying crops like mango, citrus and oil palm. Object oriented techniques work best in identifying and mapping fruit orchards as against per pixel classifiers, which are more useful for field crops. This is because the information needed for image analysis and classification is represented in meaningful image objects and their mutual relations. This study aims at mapping multiple crops, viz. mango and oil palm in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. Multi-resolution segmentation has been done after assigning scale parameter and weightages to various parameters like shape, compactness, color, smoothness and NDVI. Subsequently, the potential mango and oil palm areas have been delineated based on texture and shape/geometry information obtained from high resolution PAN data. Field validation of the crop map indicated 89% agreement with field data. Hence multiple high resolution datasets have the potential to map the spatial distribution of mango and oil palm plantations at district and subdistrict level.

As greater numbers of SMS messages are communicated every day, it is very difficult for a user to remember and correlate the newer SMS messages received in context to previously received SMS. SMS threads provide a solution to this problem. In this work the problem of SMS spam detection and thread identification is discussed and a state of the art clustering-based algorithm is presented. The work is planned in two stages. In the first stage the binary classification technique is applied to categorize SMS messages into two categories namely, spam and non-spam SMS; then, in the second stage, SMS clusters are created for non-spam SMS messages using non-negative matrix factorization and K-means clustering techniques. A threading-based similarity feature, that is, time between consecutive communications, is described for the identification of SMS threads, and the impact of the time threshold in thread identification is also analysed experimentally. Performance parameters like accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure are also evaluated. The SMS threads identified in this proposed work can be used in applications like SMS thread summarization, SMS folder classification and other SMS management-related tasks. © The Author(s) 2015.",K- means clustering; non-negative matrix factorization; SMS clustering; SMS thread; thread identification; thread identification in SMS,Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Matrix algebra; Text processing; Binary classification; Clustering-based algorithms; K-means clustering; K-means clustering techniques; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Performance parameters; State of the art; Text classification; Factorization,"Nagwani, N.K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: asharaff.cs@nitrr.ac.in",,SAGE Publications Ltd,1655515,,JISCD,,English,J Inf Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011629749

This process or method improves the classification accuracy by removing irrelevant and noisy features. FS is implemented using either batch learning or online learning. Currently, the FS methods are executed in batch learning. Nevertheless, these techniques take longer execution time and require larger storage space to process the entire dataset. Due to the lack of scalability, the batch learning process cannot be used for large data. In the present study, a scalable efficient Online Feature Selection (OFS) approach using the Sparse Gradient (SGr) technique was proposed to select the features from the dataset online. In this approach, the feature weights are proportionally decremented based on the threshold value, which results in attaining zeros for the insignificant features' weights. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach, an extensive set of experiments was conducted using 13 real-world datasets that range from small to large size. The results of the experiments showed an improved classification accuracy of 15%, which is considered to be significant when compared with the existing methods. © 2017 TÜBITAK.",Big-data analytics; Data analysis; Data preprocessing; Feature selection; Online learning,Big data; Data reduction; Digital storage; E-learning; Feature extraction; Attribute selection; Classification accuracy; Data analytics; Data preprocessing; Model construction; Online feature selection; Online learning; Real-world datasets; Classification (of information),"Senthilkumar, R.; Department of Information Technology, Madras Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: radhasenthil@annauniv.edu",,Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences,13000632,,,,English,Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010720986

If the weights of an MLP are not initialized properly, it may fail to achieve good generalization. In this article, we propose a weight initialization technique for MLP to improve its generalization. This is achieved by a regularized stacked auto-encoder based pre-training method. During pre-training, the weights between each adjacent layers of an MLP, upto the penultimate layer, are trained layer wise by an auto-encoder. To train the auto-encoder, we use weighted sum of two terms: (i) mean squared error (MSE) and (ii) sum of squares of the first order derivatives of the outputs with respect to inputs. Here, the second term acts as a regularizer. It is used to penalize the training of auto-encoder during pre-training to generate better initial values of the weights for each successive layers of MLP. To compare the proposed initialization technique with random weight initialization, we have considered ten standard classification data sets. Empirical results show that the proposed initialization technique improves the generalization of MLP. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Auto-encoder; Initialization; Multi-layer perceptron; Pre-training; Regularization,Classification (of information); Computation theory; Learning systems; Mean square error; Auto encoders; Initialization; Multi layer perceptron; Pre-training; Regularization; Signal encoding,"Pal, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, DurgapurIndia; email: tandra.pal@gmail.com",Martin-Vide C.Vega-Rodriguez M.A.Neruda R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Results of recent ASV spoof 2015 challenge indicate that spoof-aware features are a possible solution, rather than focusing on a powerful classifier. In this paper, we investigate the effect of various frequency scales (such as, ERB, Mel and linear) applied on a Gabor filterbank. The output of filterbank was used to exploit the contribution of instantaneous frequency (IF) in each subband energy via Teager Energy Operator-based Energy Separation Algorithm (TEO-ESA) to capture possible changes in spectral envelope of spoofed speech. The IF is computed from narrowband components of the speech signal and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied on deviations in IF, which are referred to as Instantaneous Frequency Cosine Coefficients (IFCC). The classification results on static features shows an EER of 1.32% with Mel frequency scale and 1.87% with linear. The results with delta feature of linear frequency scale gets reduced further to 1.39% whereas, with Mel scale, it increased by 0.64% on development set of ASV spoof 2015 challenge database. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Automatic Speaker Verification; Energy Separation Algorithm; Gabor filterbank; Spoofed speech; Teager Energy Operator,Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Discrete cosine transforms; Filter banks; Gabor filters; Pattern recognition; Speech; Speech processing; Speech recognition; Speech synthesis; Automatic speaker verification; Classification results; Cosine coefficient; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Energy separation algorithm; Instantaneous frequency; Spectral envelopes; Teager energy operators; Classification (of information),"Kamble, M.R.; Speech Research Lab, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT)India; email: madhu_kamble@daiict.ac.in",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In recent years, a variety of CAD system has been proposed for the detection of leukemia. Acute leukemia is a malignant neoplastic disorder that influences a larger fraction of world population. In modern medical science, there are sufficient newly formulated methodologies for the early detection of leukemia. Such advanced technologies include medical image processing methods for the detection of the syndrome. This paper shows that use of a highly appropriate feature extraction technique is required for the classification of a disease. In the field of image processing and machine learning approach, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a well-known technique. Nucleus features are extracted from the RGB image. The proposed method provides an opportunity to fine-tune the accuracy for the detection of the disease.

Recent statistics from the Bureau of Labour indicate, back injuries account for one of every five injuries in the workplace. Eighty per cent of these injuries occur to the lower back and are associated with manual materials handling tasks. According to the Industrial ergonomic safety manual, Squatting is the correct posture for lifting a heavy object. In this work, an attempt has been made to monitor posture of the workers during squat and stoop using 3D motion capture and machine learning techniques. For this, Microsoft Kinect V2 is used for capturing the depth data. Further, Dynamic Time Warping and Euclidian distance algorithms are used for extraction of features. Ada-boost algorithm is used for classification of stoop and squat. The results show that the 3D image data is large and complex to analyze. The application of nonlinear and linear metrics captures the variation in the lifting pattern. Additionally, the features extracted from this metric resulted in a classification accuracy of 85% and 81% respectively.

However this is a nontrivial task as limited contextual information is available. As the information available about the apps is short and sparse, the classification of these apps can also be considered as coming in the category of classification of short and spares text. To classify these short and spares text, various methods are present that can be used to classify the mobile apps. In this paper, we have presented a method in which we extract the information about the apps from the sources like information from the labels (app name), information from the web search engine (snippets), contextual usage logs of users and the permissions the app requests before installation. This gives an effective and secure classification of the apps as source for most of these apps are some unknown vendors and so they are having the higher possibility of being malicious.

The reduced dimension representation obtained using the unsupervised techniques may not capture the discrimination information. The supervised techniques, such as multiple discriminant analysis and generalized discriminant analysis, can capture discriminatory information. However the reduced dimension is limited by number of classes. We propose a supervised technique, kernel entropy discriminant analysis (kernel EDA), that uses Euclidean divergence as criterion function. Parzen window method for density estimation is used to find an estimate of Euclidean divergence. Euclidean divergence estimate is expressed in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the kernel gram matrix. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors that contribute significantly to the Euclidean divergence estimate are used for determining the directions for projection. Effectiveness of the kernel EDA method is demonstrated through the improved classification accuracy for benchmark datasets. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Euclidean divergence; Parzen windowing,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Entropy; Pattern recognition; Discrimination informations; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Eigenvectors and eigenvalues; Euclidean; Generalized discriminant analysis; Multiple discriminant analysis; Parzen windowing; Unsupervised techniques; Principal component analysis,"Mehta, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: aditya.mhta@gmail.com",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Among the methods which handle class imbalance problem, undersampling is a data level approach which preprocesses the data set to reduce the size of the majority class instances. Most of the existing undersampling methods apply either prototype selection or clustering techniques to balance the data set. They are effective and popular, but both processes are complex. Drawbacks of the cluster based undersampling methods are: The quality of the chosen majority class samples varies depending on clustering algorithm, number of clusters and also the convergence is difficult. Drawback of prototype selection methods is that they have to compare each majority instance with it’s k nearest neighbors to decide which majority class instance should be selected/discarded which is not only time consuming and is also difficult to implement for large datasets. Proposed undersampling method MahalanobisCentroidbasedUndersampingwithFilter (MahalCUSFilter) overcomes the above said problems: parameter dependence, complexity and information loss. Proposed method is used in conjunction with c4.5 and kNN classifiers, and found to improve the minority class classification rate of all datasets with comparable overall performance for the entire dataset. To the best of our knowledge this kind of grouping has not been used in undersampling to improve the classification accuracy of imbalanced data sets. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Class imbalance problems; Classification accuracy; Classification rates; Clustering techniques; Imbalanced Data-sets; Machine learning research; Parameter dependence; Prototype selection; Classification (of information),"Chennuru, V.K.; SCIS, University of HyderabadIndia; email: cvkrishnaveni19@gmail.com",Pal R.Ghosh A.Prasath R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The number of samples in the microarray data set is very small compared to the number of genes as features. To reduce dimensionality, selection of significant genes is necessary. An effective method of gene feature selection helps in dimensionality reduction and improves the performance of the sample classification. In this work, we have examined if combination of feature selection methods can improve the performance of classification algorithms.

The two streams are a combination of dense optical flow features with: (a) RGB frames; and (b) salient object regions detected using a fast space-time saliency method. The main contribution is in the design of a classifier moderated method to fuse information from the two streams at multiple stages of the network, which enables capturing the most discriminative and complimentary features for localizing the spatio-temporal attention for the action being performed. This mutual auto-exchange of information in local and global contexts, produces an optimal combination of appearance and dynamism, for enhanced discrimination, thus producing the best performance of categorization.

Potential consumers exhibit sincere intents in seeking opinions of other consumers who have already had a usage experience of the products they are intending to make a purchase decision on. The underlying businesses also deem it fit to ascertain common public opinions regarding the quality of their products as well as services. However, the consumer reviews have bulked over time to such an extent that it has become a highly challenging task to read all the reviews, even if limiting to only the top ones, to reach an informed purchase decision or have an insight regarding how satisfied or not the consumers of a particular product are. Since most of the reviews are either unstructuctured or semi-structured, information classification is employed to derive knowledge from the reviews. However, most classification methods based on sentiment orientation of reviews do not detect which features of a product were specifically liked or disliked by a reviewer. This constitutes itself into another problem since most consumers are on the lookout for certain prerequisite features while viewing the products. The paper proposes a Consumer Satisfaction Rating System (CSRS) based on sentiment analysis of consumer reviews in context of the features of a product. The system aims at providing a summary that represents the extent to which the consumers were satisfied or unsatisfied with the specific features of a product. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.",E-Commerce; Online reviews; Opinion mining; Product features; Sentiment analysis,Classification (of information); Commerce; Electronic commerce; Smart city; Classification methods; Consumer satisfactions; Information classification; Online reviews; Opinion mining; Product feature; Purchase decision; Sentiment analysis; Data mining,"Gaurav, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: kumargaurav.nitp@gmail.com",Simintiras A.Al-Sharhan S.Kar A.K.Ilavarasan P.V.Gupta M.P.Mantymaki M.Dwivedi Y.K.Janssen M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

This assists forensic analysts to map a suspect’s camera with a possibly illegal image repository, or to attribute an image under question to its legitimate source. Counter–forensic attacks to Camera Model Identification techniques, primarily comprise of image anonymization. Image Anonymization is a technique adopted by an intelligent adversary for modifying an image illegitimately, so as to disable attribution of the image to its source; hence to fool a forensic analyst and prevent image source identification. In the recent years, there has been a rapid growth of research interest in the domain of counter–forensics. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether an image under question has undergone any form of counter–forensic source anonymization attack. This will enable a forensic analyst to find out whether an image, whose source is being investigated, is authentic, or has it been tampered so as to prevent correct source identification. We deal with three major classes of source anonymization attacks in this paper, viz., Seam Carving, Fingerprint Copying, and Adaptive PRNU Denoising. If an image is detected to have indeed undergone a counter–forensic attack, the proposed model additionally enables detection of the specific class of attack, through multiclass classification.

An novel optimization approach based on top-down features is used to remove the errors that occurs in the symbol extraction and recognition task. A depth first traversal algorithm is used to find the connections between the symbols and then image is represented in the form of usable data structure. The system is evaluated on a dataset of 20 analog electronic circuit images collected from various sources and the results are presented. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Bayesian inference; Circuit netlist; Document image analysis; Domain knowledge; Graphics recognition; Pattern recognition; Symbol recognition; Top down optimization,Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Electric network analysis; Extraction; Image processing; Inference engines; Timing circuits; Bayesian inference; Document image analysis; Domain knowledge; Graphics recognition; Netlist; Symbol recognition; Topdown; Pattern recognition,"Agarwal, S.; Indian Institute of Technology DelhiIndia; email: shubhamagarwal003@gmail.com",Lamiroy B.Lins R.D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Geometry-based point classification (line-, surface-, point-type features) is determined using shape of the local neighborhood, given by the local geometric descriptor (LGD) at every point in the point cloud. Covariance matrix of local neighborhoods is the conventionally used LGD in the LiDAR community. However, it is known that covariance analysis has drawbacks in detection of sharp features, which are a subset of the line-type features. Here, we compare the performance of new variants of existing LGDs, such as weighted covariance matrix, and that based on tensor voting concept, in geometric classification with that of covariance matrix. We propose a multi-scale probabilistic saliency map based on eigenvalues of the LGDs for computing the classification. Usually the state-of-the-art performance analyses of LGDs in the classification outcomes are done downstream after feature extraction. We propose that the comparisons may be done upstream at the classification stage itself, which can be achieved by expressing these LGDs as positive semidefinite second-order tensors. We perform qualitative comparisons of the tensor fields based on shape and orientation of the tensors, and the classification outcomes using visualizations. We visualize LGDs using superquadric tensor glyphs and point rendering, using our proposed saliency map as colormap. Our detailed comparative analysis shows that the new variant of LGDs based on tensor voting classify line-type features, especially sharp features, better than covariance-based LGDs. Our proposed LGD based on tensor voting performs better than the covariance matrix, for our goal of detecting sharp features, e.g. gabled roofs in buildings. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Covariance matrix; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Extraction; Feature extraction; Geometry; Image segmentation; Matrix algebra; Optical radar; Tensors; Comparative analysis; Geometric classification; Geometric descriptor; Point sampled geometry; Positive semidefinite; Second-order tensors; State-of-the-art performance; Weighted covariance; Classification (of information),"Sreevalsan-Nair, J.; Graphics-Visualization-Computing Lab, International Institute of Information Technology BangaloreIndia; email: jnair@iiitb.ac.in",,Springer Heidelberg,16123786,,,,English,Math.

The goal of this work was to compare the performance of different classifiers tested on spatio-temporal features used to distinguish between true and distorted handwriting behaviour to detect deception using machine learning experiments. Dynamic handwriting features depict a writer’s individuality and neuro-psychic condition. Handwritten features share inter-class characteristics while a few of them are very unique to an individual writer. However, extraction of discriminating features & selecting them in decision making process with respect to an individual is really crucial and complex thing, which helps the construction of any classifier, aiming to build the decision support system. Spatio-temporal attributes carry significant discriminatory information in deception detection. In this work, a set of total twelve features (spatial and temporal with pressure measures) features were used from online handwritten data. Five different classifiers (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) were tested on these feature set with three separate factual descriptions: Person, Action & Event, in both true and distorted mode to develop a decision support system based on the outcome of the experiment on handwriting behaviour.

A method of converting an imbalanced text corpus into a balanced one is presented. The presented method employs a clustering algorithm for conversion. Initially to avoid curse of dimensionality, an effective representation scheme based on term class relevancy measure is adapted, which drastically reduces the dimension to the number of classes in the corpus. Subsequently, the samples of larger sized classes are grouped into a number of subclasses of smaller sizes to make the entire corpus balanced. Each subclass is then given a single symbolic vector representation by the use of interval valued features. This symbolic representation in addition to being compact helps in reducing the space requirement and also the classification time. The proposed model has been empirically demonstrated for its superiority on bench marking datasets viz., Reuters 21578 and TDT2. Further, it has been compared against several other existing contemporary models including model based on support vector machine. The comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model outperforms the other existing models. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Clustering; Feature selection; Skewed text data; Symbolic data representation; Text classification,Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Clustering; Curse of dimensionality; Representation schemes; Symbolic data representation; Symbolic representation; Text classification; Text data; Vector representations; Text processing,"Suhil, M.; Department of Studies in Computer Science, University of MysoreIndia; email: mahamad45@yahoo.co.in",Hangarge M.Negi A.Bevilacqua V.Santosh K.C.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

In order to keep the patient's vision, the early detection and periodic screening of DR plays an important role in eye diagnosis by examining the deformity in retinal fundus images. During the early detection of DR, ophthalmologists identify the lesions called microaneurysms that emerge as the first symptom of the disease. The various test methods availability and the handlings of all these test methods for detection of DR are not possible in rural areas. The automatic DR detection system offers the potential to be used in large-scale screening programs. This paper presents a hybrid classifier and region-dependent integrated features for detection of DR automatically. In the proposed hybrid classifier, holoentropy enabled decision tree is combined with a feed forward neural network using the proposed score level fusion method. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing classification algorithms using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Extracted features represent the descriptive nature of the imaging modality for machine learning. Texture description, is one such method which is used to extract the informative aspect of the object. In this paper a new texture based feature extraction algorithm is proposed for extracting relevant and informative features from brain MR Images having tumor. Suggested algorithm is based on finding the texture description using nine different variants of texture objects. Subsequently, the intermediate texture index matrix is formed using texture objects with high pass and low pass spiral filters. The resultant two index matrix are used to generate the Texture Co-occurrence Matrix (TOM). TOM helps to extract the spatial and spectral domain features that forms the hybrid feature set for brain MRI classification. Using TOM, an experimentation is performed with a dataset of 660 T1-weighted post contrast brain MR Images having 5 different types of malignant tumors.

Though various attempts have made to solve this issue by clustering input data using different clustering algorithms like k-means, k-medoids, and SOFM etc. However main difficulty of determining the optimal number of neurons in the pattern layer remain unsolved. In this paper, we present a new model based on cluster validity index with radial basis neural network for classification of diabetic patients data. We employ cluster validity index in class by class fashion for determining the optimal number of neurons in pattern layer. A new convex fitness function has also been designed for bat inspired optimization algorithm to identify the weights between summation layer and pattern layer. The proposed model for radial basis function neural network is tested on Pima Indians Diabetes data set and synthetic data sets. Experimental results proved that our approach performs better in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, classification time, training time, network complexity and computational time compared to conventional radial basis function neural network. It is also proved that proposed model performs better compared to familiar classifiers namely probabilistic neural network, feed forward neural network, cascade forward network, time delay network, artificial immuine system and GINI classifier. © 2017, the Authors.",Bat Algorithm; Classification; Diabetes; Medical diagnosis; Optimal number of clusters; Radial Basis Function Networks,Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Computer aided diagnosis; Conformal mapping; Diagnosis; Functions; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Medical problems; Network layers; Neural networks; Optimization; Time delay; Two phase flow; Bat algorithms; Cluster validity indices; Optimal number; Optimization algorithms; Pima indians diabetes data sets; Probabilistic neural networks; Radial basis function neural networks; Radial basis neural networks; Radial basis function networks,"Cheruku, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology GoaIndia; email: rmlswamygoud@nitgoa.ac.in",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,18756891,,,,English,Int.

The effect of a large value of noise term, as irreducible error in Expected Prediction Error (EPE) is first discussed. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how in extreme conditions the traditional approaches fare at par with large neural networks, which generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks trained for classification barely fit a random labeling of the training data as an extreme condition to learn. This phenomenon is quantitatively unaffected even if we train the CNNs with completely inseparable data. This can be due to large degree of corruption of the entire data by random noise or random labels associated with data due to observation error. We corroborate these experimental findings by showing that depth six CNN (VGG-6) fails to overcome large noise in image signals. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Classification; Convolutional neural networks; EPE; Noise; SVM,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Errors; Neural networks; Classification performance; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Extreme conditions; Irreducible errors; Noise; Systematic experiment; Traditional approaches; Pattern recognition,"Banerjee, S.; Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: samik@cse.iitm.ac.in",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Log dyadic wavelet transform (LDWT) is capable of representing image patches with high accuracy.

The first stage consists of a cascade of 4 face detectors constructed using discriminative facial ST features selected by the ADABOOST feature selection method.

The work presented in this paper focuses on image decolorization and classification as two stages. The first stage or objective of this paper is to improve the performance of the color scene classification system using deep belief networks (DBN) and support vector machines (SVM). Therefore, color scene classification system termed as AGMM-DBN-SVM is proposed using the existing feature extraction technique called bags of visual words (BoW) derived from the dense scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and adapted Gaussian mixture models (AGMM). The second stage of the presented work is to combine the proposed AGMM-DBN-SVM classification models obtained for the two different image decolorization methods called rgb2gray and singular value decomposition (SVD) based color-To-grayscale image mapping techniques to significantly increase the performance of the proposed color scene classification system. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is experimented on Oliva Torralba (OT) scene dataset containing 8 different classes. The classification rate of the proposed color scene classification system applied on OT 8 scene dataset is significantly greater than the one of the existing benchmarks color scene classification system developed using AGMM and SVM. © 2017 IEEE.",,Color; Color image processing; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machines; Classification rates; Decolorization methods; Deep belief network (DBN); Deep belief networks; Feature extraction and classification; Feature extraction techniques; Gaussian Mixture Model; Scale invariant feature transforms; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Lack of domain knowledge prevents the patients to refine the query using well-known feedback mechanism. Moreover, due to scarcity of doctors in rural India, the health assistants who run the health centers do not have enough knowledge to treat the patients based on the imprecise query. In the paper, we propose an autonomous provisional disease diagnosis system by classifying the query, which has been expanded using semantic of the domain knowledge. First, we apply spatial distribution based nearest neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) on the disease related medical document corpus (MDC) to find the relevant terms, mostly symptoms with respect to different diseases. We frame a symptom vocabulary (SV) with the unique terms present in different diseases, known apriori. Each query is expanded as bag of symptoms (BoS) using 5-gram collocation model and log likelihood ratio (LLR) to measure the association between the query and the terms in the MDC. The terms in the BoS may not exactly match with the symptoms in the SV but have contextual similarity. We propose a novel approach to know which symptoms in the SV are nearest in context to the corresponding terms in the BoS. The feature vector is obtained by encoding the SV with respect to (w.r.t.) each BoS, which is sparse in nature. We apply sparse representation based classifier (SRC) to classify the query into a particular disease. Proposed nearest neighbor spacing distribution based sparse representation classifier (NNSD-SRC) shows promising performance considering MDC dataset and we validate the results with the doctors showing negligible error. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Provisional diagnosis; Sparse classifier; Spatial distribution,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Health; Pattern recognition; Rural areas; Semantics; Spatial distribution; Disease diagnosis; Feedback mechanisms; Imprecise queries; Log likelihood ratios (LLR); Medical documents; Nearest-neighbor spacing distributions; Sparse classifiers; Sparse representation; Diagnosis,"Bhattacharya, I.; Department of Computer Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and TechnologyIndia; email: indrani.84@hotmail.com",Shankar B.U.Ghosh K.Mandal D.P.Ray S.S.Pal S.K.Zhang D.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The proposed system makes use of the fact that when the speech signals are replayed, they pass through multiple channels as opposed to original recordings. This channel information is typically embedded in low signal to noise ratio regions. A speech signal processing method with high spectro - temporal resolution is required to extract robust features from such regions. The single frequency filtering (SFF) is one such technique, which we propose to use for replay attack detection. While SFF based feature representation was used at front-end, Gaussian mixture model and bi-directional long short-term memory models are investigated at the backend as classifiers. The experimental results on ASVspoof 2017 dataset reveal that, SFF based representation is very effective in detecting replay attacks. The score level fusion of back end classifiers further improved the performance of the system which indicates that both classifiers capture complimentary information Copyright © 2017 ISCA.",Bi-directional long short-term memory; Countermeasures; Gaussian mixture model; Replay attack; Single frequency filtering; Spoofing,Audio signal processing; Brain; Classification (of information); Gaussian distribution; Long short-term memory; Radar countermeasures; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Speech; Speech recognition; Bi-directional; Gaussian Mixture Model; Replay attack; Single frequency; Spoofing; Speech communication,,Lacerda F.Strombergsson S.Wlodarczak M.Heldner M.Gustafson J.House D.,International Speech Communication Association,2308457X,,,,English,"Proc.

On similar lines, a curriculum based feature selection framework is proposed for identifying most useful features in a dataset. Given a dataset, first, easy and difficult samples are identified. In general, the number of easy samples is assumed larger than difficult samples. Then, feature selection is done in two stages. In the first stage a fast feature selection method which gives feature scores is used. Feature scores are then updated incrementally with the set of difficult samples. The existing feature selection methods are not incremental in nature; entire data needs to be used in feature selection. The use of curriculum learning is expected to decrease the time needed for feature selection with classification accuracy comparable to the existing methods. Curriculum learning also allows incremental refinements in feature selection as new training samples become available. Our experiments on a number of standard datasets demonstrate that feature selection is indeed faster without sacrificing classification accuracy. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

One of the most critical problems for this model is how to overcome heterogeneity and scalability in different systems. The decreases of performance in heterogeneous environment occur due to inefficient scheduling of Map and Reduce tasks. Another important problem is how to minimize master node overhead and network traffic created by scheduling algorithm.

Positional geometry of webpage objects (wireframe) is an important factor for determining the webpage aesthetics as shown in studies. In this paper, we propose a computational model for predicting webpage aesthetics based on the positional geometry. We have considered 13 features of positional geometry that affect aesthetics, as reported in literature. By varying these 13 features, we have designed 52 interfaces’ wireframes and rated them by 100 users in a 5 point rating scale. Our 1 dimensional ANOVA study on users’ rating shows, 9 out of the 13 features are important for webpage aesthetics. Based on these 9 features, we created a computational model for webpage aesthetics prediction. Our computational model works based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). To judge the efficacy of our model, we considered 10 popular webpages’ wireframes, and got them rated by 80 users.

There is, literally, a huge body of literature which deals with the application of Fisher's discriminant analysis in problems of statistical classification and describes its desirable properties. The method is supposed to work well whenever there is a suitable numerical feature vector having different statistical distributions under the different classes. In this paper we will present some applications of FDA that discriminate between cipher texts in terms of a finite set of encryption algorithms. Specifically, we use ten algorithms, five each of stream and block cipher types, and, given a cipher text, try to identify which algorithm was used in the encryption of the given cipher. Our results display good classification with some of the features. Our limited study clearly shows that further exploration of this classification problem based on FDA could be worthwhile. © 2017, DESIDOC.",Classification; Encryption; Fisher's discriminant analysis,Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Population statistics; Different class; Encryption algorithms; Fisher's discriminant; Numerical features; Problem-based; Statistical classification; Statistical distribution; Stream and block ciphers; Cryptography,,,Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre,0011748X,,DSJOA,,English,Def.

Though some efforts are found for the English language, for regional languages like Bengali, Hindi, Guajarati etc. it is very rare or not started yet. Thus objectives of this work is to develop a method to identify isolated Bengali letter/alphabet (Swarabarna and Banjanbarna), from uttered sound. In speech processing, identifying a particular uttered letter consists of two major steps, Speech Feature Extraction and Feature Classification. Studies show that Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) give better representation of human auditory system, but at the same time with increased noise, performance of MFCC degrades, which may be reduced by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Thus MFCC combined with DWT is used as a feature termed as Mel Frequency Wavelet Transform Coefficient (MFWTC) for this work. For experiment, a sound database is developed by uttering of 43 Bengali alphabets {11 Swarabarna and 32 Banjanbarna} by ten speakers, 20 times for each letter. Then these signals are pre-processed to remove the silent portion from both end points followed by applying pre-emphasized filter. Next, MFCC features are extracted from preprocessed signals. These features are then fine-tuned by applying DWT to compute MFWTC features. Not only these feature, Zero Crossing Count(ZCC) are also used independently to compare with this method. Finally these features are used to recognize the Bengali Barnas using different classifiers (BayesNet, NaiveBayes, IB1, LWL, Classification Via Clustering, Dagging, Multi Scheme, VFI, Conjunctive Rule, ZeroR, BFTree and Simple Cart) available in Weka tools. The classification accuracy is measured using 10-fold cross validation method, which shows the average 47.61% and 62.19% for Swarabarna and Banjanbarna respectively. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.",Automatic letter identification; Bengali speech; Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC); Zero Crossing Count (ZCC),Artificial intelligence; Audition; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Speech processing; Wavelet transforms; 10-fold cross-validation; Bengalis; Classification accuracy; Feature classification; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Voice signal processing; Wavelet transform coefficients; Zero-crossing count; Speech recognition,"Phadikar, S.; Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, BF-142, Sector-I, India; email: sphadikar@yahoo.com",Mandal J.K.Mukhopadhyay S.Dutta P.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

ConvRBM is a generative model trained in an unsupervised way to model the audio signals of arbitrary lengths. ConvRBM is trained using annealed dropout technique and parameters are optimized using Adam optimization. The subband filters of ConvRBM learned from the ESC-50 database resemble Fourier basis in the mid-frequency range while some of the low-frequency subband filters resemble Gammatone basis. The auditory-like filterbank scale is nonlinear w.r.t. the center frequencies of the subband filters and follows the standard auditory scales. We have used our proposed model as a front-end for the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) task with supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a back-end. Using CNN classifier, the ConvRBM filterbank (ConvRBMBANK) and its score-level fusion with the Mel filterbank energies (FBEs) gave an absolute improvement of 10.65 %, and 18.70 % in the classification accuracy, respectively, over FBEs alone on the ESC-50 database. This shows that the proposed ConvRBM filterbank also contains highly complementary information over the Mel filterbank, which is helpful in the ESC task.

Existing methods use only TF-IDF rating to represent either unigram or n-gram feature vectors. Some approaches leverage upon the use of existing sentiment dictionaries and use the score of a unigram sentiment word as the feature vector and ignore TF-IDF rating. In this work, we construct n-gram sentiment features by extracting the sentiment words and their intensifiers or negations from a review. Then the score of an n-gram constructed from lexicon of semantic unigram and its intensifier or negation is multiplied to TF-IDF rating to determine the feature score. We experiment with two benchmark data sets for sentiment classification using Support Vector Machine and Maximum Entropy method with cross domain validation by considering training and testing data from two different sets and obtain a substantial improvement in terms of various performance measures compared to existing methods.

This incoming data from heterogeneous sources is referred as data stream. Analysing data in motion (data streams) has become new challenge in order to meet the demands of real time analytics. Conventional mining techniques are proving inefficient since the behaviour of data itself has changed. Other challenges associated with data streams include resources constraints like memory and running time along with single scan of the data. Due to the time variant nature of data streams, applying any mining algorithm such as classification, clustering, indexing in a single scan of data is a tedious task. This paper focuses on concept drift problem in classification of streaming data. During classification a change in the concept or distribution of dataset over the time is termed as concept drift. The performance of a model/classifier degrades due to concept drift even in stationary data; dealing with this problem hence become more challenging in data streams. This paper presents categorization of existing streaming data classification algorithms along with their ability to solve concept drift problem. It also presents comparison of various tools available for simulating such problems along with their limitations. The paper also lists the various datasets and performance metrics that have been used in literature for performance analysis. Thus, this paper may serve as a complete roadmap for the researchers interested in designing new solutions for solving concept drift problem in streaming data classification.

Apart from its simplicity, the proposed CCMCA method shows better and consistent performance with lowest standard deviation as compared to fixed rule and simple trainable fusion techniques irrespective of the feature set used across all the databases used in the experiment.

Mining medical data is the most challenging task as the data are subjected to many social concerns and ethical issues. Moreover, medical data are more illegible as they contain many missing and misleading values and may sometimes be faulty. Thus, pre-processing tasks in medical data mining are of great importance, and the main focus is on feature selection, because the quality of the input determines the quality of the resultant data mining process. This paper provides insight to develop a feature selection process, where a data set subjected to constraint-governed association rule mining and interestingness measures results in a small feature subset capable of producing better classification results. From the results of the experimental study, the feature subset was reduced to more than 50% by applying syntax-governed constraints and dimensionality-governed constraints, and this resulted in a high-quality result.

In a two layer binary cascaded approach proposed in our methodology, an unlabelled recording is initially classified into one of the two intermediate classes ('normal+others' and 'AF+noisy') at the first layer before actual classification at the second layer. The Physionet Challenge 2017 dataset containing more than 8500 ECG recordings are used for creation of training models and interval validation. The proposed methodology yields an average F1-score of 0.91, 0.79 and 0.77 respectively in classifying normal, AF and other rhythms on the training dataset using 5-fold cross validation. Results also show that, the said methodology, when applied on a hidden test set maintained by the challenge organisers yields F1-score values of 0.92, 0.86 and 0.74 in classifying the same. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society.

This leads to reduction in efficiency and disinclination of motor skills. Analysis of mental fatigue thus becomes momentous for assessing one’s capability. The aim here is to analyse whether motor imagery is fatiguing. There are many parameters to evaluate fatigue. This study analyses parietal alpha and frontal theta in motor imagery tasks. Decrement of arousal level, working memory and information encoding have been proven to be associated with increased theta power. Increase in alpha power indicates increase in mental effort to maintain vigilance level. When a person experiences fatigue, their concentration, attention, focus and vigilance level decreases for which they need to put more attention which leads to increase in alpha power. We exploit these EEG oscillatory rhythm fluctuations to model EEG-fatigue relationships. A statistical classifier is used to model EEG-fatigue relationship accurately.

In multi-label learning, each instance is associated with more than one label as in semantic scene understanding, text categorization and bio-informatics. Semi-supervised multi-label learning has attracted recent interest as gathering labeled data is both expensive and requires manual effort. Further, many of the labels have semantic correlation which manifests as co-occurrence and this information can be used to build effective classifiers in the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose two different graph based transductive methods, namely, the label correlation propagation and the k-nearest neighbors based label correlation propagation.

Over the years, several works on accurate detection of vowel regions and the corresponding vowel onset points (VOPs) and vowel end points (VEPs) have been reported. A novel front-end feature extraction technique exploiting the temporal and spectral characteristics of the excitation source information in the speech signal is proposed in this paper to improve the detection of vowel regions, VOPs and VEPs. To do the same, a three-class classifiers (vowel, non-vowel and silence) is developed on the TIMIT database using the proposed features as well as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). Statistical modeling based on deep neural network has been employed for learning the parameters. Using the developed three-class classifier, a given speech sample is then forced aligned against the trained acoustic models to detect the vowel regions. The use of proposed feature results in detection of vowel regions quite different from those obtained through the MFCC. Exploiting the differences in the evidences obtained by using the two kinds of features, a technique to combine the evidences is also proposed in order to get a better estimate of the VOPs and VEPs.

Trajectories of minimum Eigen feature points help to capture the important motion information of videos. Optical flow is used to track the feature points smoothly and to obtain robust trajectories. Descriptors are extracted around the trajectories to characterize appearance by Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), motion by Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH). MBH computed from differential optical flow outperforms for videos with more camera motion. The encoding of feature vectors is performed by bag of visual features technique.

Recent research shows that a range of miRNAs are involved in the regulation of immunity and its deregulation results in immune mediated diseases such as cancer, inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Computational discovery of these immune miRNAs using a set of specific features is highly desirable. In the current investigation, we present a SVM based classification system which uses a set of novel network based topological and motif features in addition to the baseline sequential and structural features to predict immune specific miRNAs from other non-immune miRNAs. The classifier was trained and tested on a balanced set of equal number of positive and negative examples to show the discriminative power of our network features. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90.2% and outperforms the classification accuracy of 63.2% reported using the traditional miRNA sequential and structural features. The proposed classifier was further validated with two immune disease sub-class datasets related to multiple sclerosis microarray data and psoriasis RNA-seq data with higher accuracy. These results indicate that our classifier which uses network and motif features along with sequential and structural features will lead to significant improvement in classifying immune miRNAs and hence can be applied to identify other specific classes of miRNAs as an extensible miRNA classification system. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Classification; Immune diseases; miRNA; Network; SVM; Topological features,Gene expression; Networks (circuits); RNA; Topology; Transcription; Autoimmune disease; Classification accuracy; Classification system; Discriminative power; miRNA; Post-transcriptional; Structural feature; Topological features; Classification (of information); microRNA; microRNA; Article; classification; classifier; human; immunopathology; measurement accuracy; microarray analysis; multiple sclerosis; prediction; principal component analysis; priority journal; psoriasis; RNA sequence; RNA structure; support vector machine; biology; forecasting; Computational Biology; Forecasting; Humans; Immune System Diseases; MicroRNAs; Support Vector Machine,"Natarajan, J.; Data Mining and Text Mining Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics, Bharathiar UniversityIndia; email: n.jeyakumar@yahoo.co.in",,Academic Press Inc.,15320464,,JBIOB,27871823,English,J.

Such approaches are based on extracting some representative features of the images. This work studies the selection of most distinctive features for HEp-2 cell images using the random forest framework. This framework provides a notion of variable importance for ranking features, which we use to select a good subset of features from a large set so that addition of new features to this subset does not increase classification accuracy.

In this paper, an application of the SVM in the multi-class gear-fault diagnosis has been performed based on the gear vibration data in time domain. From time domain data the statistical features are extracted and fed to the SVM for the training/testing. When the training and testing data are at the same running speed, it is found that the SVM classifier has excellent multiclass classification accuracy. Though, this approach relies on the availability of both the training and testing data at that particular speed of the machine operation; it is expected that features of time domain data would change with operating speeds. Moreover, the training data may not always be available continuously at all operating speeds of gears, especially for variable-drive systems. Thus, a novel technique of interpolation/extrapolation has been proposed in the present work that helps the SVM classifier to carryout multi-class gear-fault diagnosis with appreciable accuracy even in the absence of the training data at a given running speed. It also investigates the speed bandwidth of the training data for which interpolation/extrapolation predictions are reasonably good. The similar analysis is also extended to artificial neural networks (ANN) as the classifier and predictions are noted, and compared with the SVM. © 2017 Baishideng Publishing Group Co. Limited.

They have highly improved in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions and by the sheer volume of collected images, the necessity of simplification of automation in feature extraction. Road data play a key role in urban planning, traffic management, military applications, and vehicle navigation as well as for decision making in numerous applications. The faster updation of road infrastructure is a need because the technology has brought map in the hands of people in the form of mobile phones and tablets. Road detection is one of the major issues of the road infrastructure extraction. Its accuracy depends on the type of methodology used. An attempt is made here to analyse the first order, the co-occurrence texture features and image transforms useful for discriminating roads from other features specially the buildings. The identified dataset forms high dimension feature space and the Support Vector Machine is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of high dimensional datasets. In the past, SVMs have been tested and evaluated only as pixel-based image classifiers. Moving from pixel-based techniques towards object-based representation, the dimensions of remote sensing imagery feature space increases significantly. An SVM approach for classification was followed, based on primitive image objects produces by a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The SVM procedure produced the final object classification results which were compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier results and were found to give better results in OBIA domain. © 2017 ACRS.

Initially, each individual classifier is trained with existing known data represented by the extracted features. The trained classifier is then used for language identification. Results obtained from these classifiers are combined to generate the final output. Experiments are conducted using three different tonal languages, namely, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese. The output reveals that the developed multi-classifier model is able to produce promising results. The extracted features produced better results in comparison to usually used frequency value (as a feature). Ensemble of classifiers is a better tool than using individual classifiers. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Classification; Language identification; Multi-classifier; Tonal language,Character recognition; Continuous speech recognition; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Natural frequencies; Natural language processing systems; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; Ensemble of classifiers; K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN); Language identification; Maximum likelihood estimate; Minimum distance classifiers; Multi-classifier; Multi-classifier models; Tonal languages; Classification (of information),"Ghosh, S.; South Point High School, 82/7A Ballygunge Place, India; email: annabelle.rosie00@gmail.com",Pal R.Ghosh A.Prasath R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

It has also been used to distinguish naturally and artificially ripened mangoes by analyzing the spectral signature. However the focus has been on improving the accuracy of classification after performing dimensionality reduction, optimum feature selection and using suitable learning algorithm on the complete visible and NIR spectrum range data, namely 350nm to 1050nm. In this paper we focus on, (i) the use of low wavelength resolution and low cost multispectral sensor to reliably identify artificially ripened mango by selectively using the spectral information so that classification accuracy is not hampered at the cost of low resolution spectral data and (ii) use of visible spectrum i.e. 390nm to 700 nm data to accurately discriminate artificially ripened mangoes. Our results show that on a low resolution spectral data, the use of logistic regression produces an accuracy of 98.83% and outperforms other methods like classification tree, random forest significantly. And this is achieved by analyzing only 36 spectral reflectance data points instead of the complete 216 data points available in visual and NIR range. Another interesting experimental observation is that we are able to achieve more than 98% classification accuracy by selecting only 15 irradiance values in the visible spectrum. Even the number of data needs to be collected using hyper-spectral or multi-spectral sensor can be reduced by a factor of 24 for classification with high degree of confidence. © 2017 SPIE.",Artificial Ripening; Classification; Hyperspectral Sensing; Logistic Regression; Mango; Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR); Spectral Signature; Visible Spectrum,Agriculture; Decision trees; Food safety; Fruits; Infrared devices; Reflection; Regression analysis; Artificial ripening; Hyperspectral sensing; Logistic regressions; Mango; Near infra-red reflectances; Spectral signature; Visible spectra; Classification (of information),"Kimbahune, S.; TCS Innovation Labs, Tata Consultancy Services LtdIndia; email: sanjay.kimbahune@tcs.com",Cho B.-K.Chao K.Chin B.A.Kim M.S.,SPIE,0277786X,9.78151E+12,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025128512

We hypothesize that a whispered speech spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of a set of colored noise spectra. A five-dimensional (5D) feature is computed by employing non-negative matrix factorization with a fixed basis dictionary, constructed using spectra of five colored noises. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used as the classifier. We consider two baseline features-1) Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), 2) features computed from a data driven dictionary. Experiments reveal that the features from the colored noise dictionary perform better (on average) than that using the data driven dictionary, with a relative improvement in the average V/UV accuracy of 10:30%, within, and 10:41%, across, data from seven subjects. We also find that the MFCCs and 5D features carry complementary information regarding the nature of voicing decisions in whispered speech. Hence, across all subjects, we obtain a balanced frame-level V/UV classification performance, when MFCC and 5D features are combined, compared to a skewed performance when they are considered separately.

One way to obtain ar- ticulatory features is by using an articulatory classifier (pseudo- articulatory features). The performance of the articulatory fea- tures depends on the efficacy of this classifier. But, training such a robust classifier for a low-resource language is constrained due to the limited amount of training data. We can overcome this by training the articulatory classifier using a high resource language. This classifier can then be used to generate articula- tory features for the low-resource language. However, this tech- nique fails when high and low-resource languages have mis- matches in their environmental conditions. In this paper, we address both the aforementioned problems by jointly estimat- ing the articulatory features and low-resource acoustic model. The experiments were performed on two low-resource Indian languages namely, Hindi and Tamil. English was used as the high-resource language. A relative improvement of 23% and 10% were obtained for Hindi and Tamil, respectively.

Classification accuracy is still a great challenge due to data imbalance problem. The increased volume of data is also posing a challenge for data handling and prediction, particularly when technology is used as the interface between customers and the company. As the data imbalance increases it directly affects the classification accuracy of the entire system. AUC (area under the curve) and lift proved to be good evaluation metrics. Classification techniques help to improve classification accuracy, but in case of imbalanced dataset classification accuracy does not predict well and other techniques, such as oversampling needs to be resorted. Paper presented Voting based ensembling technique to improve classification accuracy in case of imbalanced data. The voting based ensemble is based on taking the votes on the best class obtained by the three classification techniques, namely, Logistics Regression, Classification Trees and Discriminant Analysis.

For this model, a measure called retention score is proposed to estimate the retention quality of a case. A revised algorithm is proposed to estimate the competent subset of the casebase using retention score. We also propose a weighted retention score measure which considers the problem solving ability of cases that are involved in arriving at a solution. The effectiveness of the competent subset obtained from the proposed model is tested using synthetic classification dataset and housing dataset.

Deep networks are learned using huge training data where the problem of noisy labels is particularly relevant. The current techniques proposed for learning deep networks under label noise focus on modifying the network architecture and on algorithms for estimating true labels from noisy labels. An alternate approach would be to look for loss functions that are inherently noise-tolerant. For binary classification there exist theoretical results on loss functions that are robust to label noise. In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions on a loss function so that risk minimization under that loss function would be inherently tolerant to label noise for multiclass classification problems. These results generalize the existing results on noise-tolerant loss functions for binary classification. We study some of the widely used loss functions in deep networks and show that the loss function based on mean absolute value of error is inherently robust to label noise. Thus standard back propagation is enough to learn the true classifier even under label noise. Through experiments, we illustrate the robustness of risk minimization with such loss functions for learning neural networks. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The classification is carried out using different classification techniques available in Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). Classifiers were applied over defect dataset collected from NASA promise repository for different versions of four systems namely jedit, tomact, xalan, and lucene. The defect data set consist of six metrics of CK metric suite as input set and fault as class variable. Outputs of different classifiers are discussed using measures produced by data mining tool WEKA. Authors found Naive Bayes classifier as one of the best classifiers in terms of classification accuracy. Results show that if overall distribution of CK metrics is as per proposed Mean Metric Value (MMV), the probability of overall fault occurrence can be predicted under consideration of lower standard deviation values with respect to given metric values. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",CK metrics; Classifier; Naive bayes; Threshold; WEKA,Classification (of information); Classifiers; Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; NASA; Probability distributions; Software design; Software reliability; CK metrics; Classification algorithm; Naive bayes; Object-oriented software designs; Object-oriented software systems; Software fault prediction; Threshold; WEKA; Object oriented programming,"Kapoor, P.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Amity UniversityIndia; email: pkhanna@lko.amity.edu",Singh V.K.Tiwari S.Mishra K.K.Bhatia S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

We identify various linguistic features of Tumblr posts using topic modeling and linguistic inquiry and word count. We investigate the efficiency of dimensionality reduction techniques and semi-supervised classification methods for classifying the posts into various dimensions of conflicts.

Remote sensing data, methods and approaches provide the best options for large area agricultural cropland characterization for precision agricultural management practices by accurately mapping of crop type and yield indicators. Traditional multispectral broadband sensor data have known limitations of sensor saturation and absence of specific narrow bands to target and highlight specific biophysical and biochemical characteristics according to crop type. These factors lead to significant uncertainties in the discrimination of crop type. Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology provide the opportunity to measure the response of different crop type in terms of morphological and physiological characteristics. The specific narrow bands have a capability to perform crop discrimination over homogeneous and heterogeneous agricultural areas. The continuous band spectrum from imaging spectroscopy have opened up new avenues in the field of classification. In this study, crop discrimination has been carried out using principal component analysis and supervised classification techniques such as maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithms. In this study, AVIRIS-NG airborne hyperspectral data acquired on Maddur, Karnataka and equivalent multispectral LISS-IV data convolved through three broadband regions (Green: 0.52-0.59 nm, red: 0.62-0.68 nm, near-infrared: 0.77-0.86 nm) using spectral response function of Resourcesat-2 (RS-2) LISS-IV, were used over mixed and heterogeneous agricultural area of Maddur, Karnataka in Berambadi watershed located in Kabini river basin. The dominant soil types were red and black soils. Data dimensional reduction has been carried out using principal component analysis. In situ crop information were used to perform SAM and MLC-based classification. Classification accuracy was computed using confusion metrics. SAM classification showed classification accuracy of the order of 77.7 % and 42.8% with Kappa coefficient of 0.75 and 0.34 for AVIRIS-NG and LISS-IV equivalent, data, respectively. The MLC-based classification showed accuracy of 94.3% and 55.6% and Kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.46 for AVIRIS-NG and LISS-IV data. It can be concluded that imaging hyperspectral narrowband data has the potential to discriminate crops in a mixed and heterogeneous crop cluster with higher accuracy as compared to equivalent resolution multi-spectral broadband data. © 2017 ACRS.

The existence of a huge number of symbols and varying characteristics in these languages makes segmentation and extraction of text a challenging task. The Tamil language has a wide variety of the literature, and printed text is available in various forms such as newspaper, books, and magazines. In this paper, extraction of printed Tamil text from an image is done irrespective of the characteristics of the text such as font style, color, and size. The proposed work uses scanned printed Tamil text as the input image. This input image is binarized since text is always available in the foreground, and histograms can be used to segment them into lines and words. The morphological operator, dilation, is used to remove outliers such as dots and commas present in an underlying object and segment the printed text into words to facilitate text detection. Further, each character is identified using bounding box technique. Classification of Tamil letters is done by extracting features such as gradient information and curvature-based information obtained from grayscale and binary images. These features are trained, and characters are classified using Bayesian classifier. The recognized characters are documented as text using Unicode format. The performance of the approach is evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Binarization; Bounding box; Character recognition; Classification; Dilation; Segmentation; Tamil text detection,Artificial intelligence; Binary images; Classification (of information); Data mining; Extraction; Image processing; Image segmentation; Text processing; Binarizations; Bounding box; Bounding box techniques; Dilation; Extracting features; Gradient informations; Morphological operator; Text detection; Character recognition,"Manisha, S.; Department of CSE, SSN College of EngineeringIndia; email: manishas@ssn.edu.in",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Microwave SAR data provides an alternative. However, Multi-date SAR data analysis for classification of crops like Rice (transplanted) and Jute has been well established and operationalized. For other crops the research is still on using microwave data. The present study was carried out to explore the use of multi-date single and dual polarisation SAR data for assessment of rice and cotton crops. In this context, this study was conducted for Sirsa district of Haryana state, where cotton and rice are two major kharif season crops. RISAT 1 SAR data with both HH and HV polarisation was used for the study. The data acquisition dates were 23 June 2015, 18 July 2015, 12 August 2015 and 6 September 2015. The crop classification was done using ISODATA and Hierarchical Classification using multi-date RISAT HH and HV data with the ground truth collected during July. Both HH and HV signature profiles were also analysed. In case of rice, HH and HV data over four dates, showed similar pattern, though HV values were low. However, HH and HV profile patterns were significantly different in case of cotton. The classification accuracy (with 4 classes: rice, cotton, guar and other) was 84%, with kappa coefficient being 0.8331. However, when compared with DES estimates, the rice estimate was very close (-1.6% deviation), but the cotton area estimate was 22% lower than the DES estimate. Thus, though this study shows good accuracy of non-rice crop classification using dual polarisation SAR data, there is need for further work for improving the area estimation. © 2017 ACRS.

This paper investigates PolSAR and PolInSAR coherence concept for the extraction of the earth features. The methodology integrated with Polarimetric decomposition models, PolInSAR Coherence, Mahalanobis and Knowledge based classification for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using fully polarimetric RADARSAT- 2 data. Polarimetric decompositions helped to investigate and understand the scattering mechanism patterns to extract the information of the earth's features. Freeman, Yamaguchi and H/A/Alpha decomposition models were used to extract different scattering mechanisms. The results shown overestimation of the volume scattering in highly dense and oriented building, this leads to misinterpretation of these buildings as forest in PolSAR classification. This issue is addressed by incorporating PolInSAR coherence, which is sensitive to both volumetric structure and temporal change of the scatterer. Forest regions were strongly affected by the temporal and volume decorrelation with time, which show low coherence values compared to the permanent scatterers like built-up areas. The backscatter response and the coherent patterns of vegetation compared to urban area are different, this helped to extract built-up regions more accurate. Therefore, PolInSAR coherence is utilized for extraction of the features by combining polarimetric and coherence information. The PolInSAR coherence extracted from the repeat-pass RADARSAT-2 images of 24 days temporal baseline for distinguishing vegetation and built-up areas. The Mahalanobis classification algorithm was used for extracting different features. To further improve the results, Knowledge based classification was executed by forming rules based on the statistical analysis of the features. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics of the PolSAR and PolInSAR Coherence classification are 79.17% and 0.75, 86.67% and 0.84 respectively. This states that PolInSAR coherence classification helped to characterize discrete and volume scatterers more accurately than the PolSAR classification. © Corrosion and Prevention 2017.

To better differentiate the top performers, additional criteria are required. Moreover, the (test) images, on which the performance scores are based, predominantly contain fully visible objects. Therefore, ‘harder’ test images, mimicking the challenging conditions (e.g. occlusion) in which humans routinely recognize objects, need to be utilized for benchmarking. To address the concerns mentioned above, we make two contributions. First, we systematically vary the level of local objectpart content, global detail and spatial context in images from PASCAL VOC 2010 to create a new benchmarking dataset dubbed PPSS-12. Second, we propose an object-part based benchmarking procedure which quantifies classifiers’ robustness to a range of visibility and contextual settings. The benchmarking procedure relies on a semantic similarity measure that naturally addresses potential semantic granularity differences between the category labels in training and test datasets, thus eliminating manual mapping. We use our procedure on the PPSS-12 dataset to benchmark top-performing classifiers trained on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset. Our results show that the proposed benchmarking procedure enables additional differentiation among state-of-the-art object classifiers in terms of their ability to handle missing content and insufficient object detail.

Electromyography techniques can be employed with the diagnosis of muscular nerve compression and expansion abnormalities and other problems of muscles and nervous systems. An electromyogram (EMG) signal detects the electrical potential activities generated by muscle cells. These cells are activated by electrochemical signals and neurological signals. It is so difficult for the neurophysiologist to distinguish the individual waveforms generated from the muscle. Thus, the classification and feature extraction of the EMG signal becomes highly necessary. The principle of independent component analysis (ICA), fast Fourier transform (FFT) and other methods is used as dimensionality reduction methods of different critical signals extracted from human body. These different existing techniques for analysis of EMG signals have several limitations such as lower recognition rate waveforms, sensitive to continuous training and poor accuracy. In this chapter, the EMG signals are trained using soft computing techniques like adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). ANFIS is the hybrid network where fuzzy logic principle is used in neural network. This proposed technique has different advantages for better training of the EMG signals using ANFIS network with a higher reliability and better accuracy.

Our proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and text and uses them to classify the input text.

But representation of microarray data with the huge search space of thousands of gene makes this work more complex and difficult. To handle this problem both an efficient gene selection technique and efficient classifier is required. In this paper, we propose a multi-criterion Pareto differential evolution technique for feature selection. This technique first uses a wrapper technique i.e. a population based differential evolution gene selection (DEGS) algorithm for feature selection. The motivation of choosing differential evolution as compared to other learning technique is it tries to assign optimal ranks to each gene using probability distribution factor present in the microarray dataset using classification error as the fitness function. It is observed that these selections contain relevant genes as well as some irrelevant genes. So in the second phase bi-objective filter technique, called as Pareto based optimization is used to select minimum number of top ranked genes in the feature selection. Here we have considered information gain (IG) and Signal to noise ratio (SNR) as two objective functions for Pareto optimization. To verify the importance and relevance of the selected genes, classification using K-nearest neighbour (KNN), naïve Bayesian classifier (NB), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) is done. Our experiment is conducted over four well known microarray dataset. The experimental work shows that the proposed method is better than the existing searching method in terms of both classification error and predicted feature sets. The classification result shows that performance of SVM classifier is better than the result obtained using KNN, NB and ANN. Finally this method highlights its performance in terms of both relevance of genes and classification output. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

The collision of an animal with the vehicle on the highway is one such big issue, which leads to such road accidents. In this paper, a simple and a low-cost approach for automatic animal detection on highways for preventing animal-vehicle collision using computer vision techniques are proposed. A method for finding the distance of the animal in real-world units from the camera mounted vehicle is also proposed. The proposed system is trained on more than 2200 images consisting of positive and negatives images and tested on various video clips of animals on highways with varying vehicle speed. As per the two-second rule, our proposed method can alert the driver when the vehicle speed is up to 35 km/h. Beyond this speed, though the animal gets detected correctly, the driver does not get enough time to prevent a collision. An overall accuracy of almost 82.5% is achieved regarding detection using our proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.",Cascade classifier; computer vision; haar; histogram of oriented gradient; image processing; intelligent vehicle system; OpenCV; road injuries,Accidents; Animals; Classification (of information); Highway accidents; Image processing; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Cascade classifiers; haar; Histogram of oriented gradients; Intelligent vehicle systems; OpenCV; road injuries; Computer vision,"Sharma, S.U.; Department of Electronics and Communication, Gujarat Technological UniversityIndia; email: sharma.f@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018466509

Hyperspectral datasets contain large number of contiguous spectral bands with a narrow spectral bandwidth which enables identification of peculiar absorption features for distinguishing different type of soils. The potential of Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) data was tested for distinguishing black and red soils in the ICRISAT area near Hyderabad, Telangana. The AVIRIS-NG data captured in 432 narrow contiguous bands (346–2505 nm) with spectral sampling of 5 nm bandwidth and a 4m ground pixel size was used in this study. The dataset was first spectrally subsetted by identification and removal of bad bands and was atmospherically corrected by converting it to surface reflectance using FLAASH. The data was finally georeferenced using the Internal Geometry Module (IGM) parameters. Optimal spectral bands from the reflectance data were selected on the basis of different characteristics of various soils. Data dimensionality reduction technique Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) was also performed to extract noise free components. Total five classes including red and black soils were considered for land cover classification. Pixel based classification techniques such as Spectral Angle Mapper(SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were performed on the reflectance as well as MNF transformed data. SVM was also performed on data containing noise free MNF components and the selected optimal spectral bands. In the resultant classified output of reflectance data, SVM classifier provided higher accuracy and was able to classify black and red soil in a better way than SAM technique. The results also suggested that use of MNF components and specific spectral bands altogether improvised the classification of black and red soil. © 2017 ACRS.

However, in medical imaging, we believe that pixel stain quantities offer a fundamental view of the interaction between tissues and stain chemicals. Since the optical density (OD) colorspace allows to compute pixel stain quantities from pixel RGB intensities using the Beer-Lambert’s law, we propose a stain deconvolutional layer, hereby named as SD-Layer, affixed at the front of CNN that performs two functions: (1) it transforms the input RGB microscopic images to Optical Density (OD) space and (2) this layer deconvolves OD image with the stain basis learned through backpropagation and provides tissue-specific stain absorption quantities as input to the following CNN layers. With the introduction of only nine additional learnable parameters in the proposed SD-Layer, we obtain a considerably improved performance on two standard CNN architectures: AlexNet and T-CNN.

The objective of work presented lies in devising an approach to perform automatic classification of printed and handwritten text at word level, which is inherently found in pre-printed documents. The proposed work consists of three stages to perform the classification of printed and handwritten words in Telugu pre-printed documents. The stage one encompasses the feature computation from the segmented words, stage two determines text discrimination coefficient, and finally, the classification of printed and handwritten text using a decision model is accomplished in stage three. The statistical and geometrical moment features are computed with respect to the text block under consideration, and furthermore, these features are employed for determination of text discrimination coefficient.

An image is a very rich and high dimensional data structure, which can result into a considerable computation when processed upon directly. Various feature extraction techniques have been proposed to represent the images efficiently in lower dimension which is understandable by the computer. In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Haar wavelet-based approach, which extracts salient features from prominent face regions at two different scales. The approach first segments most informative geometric components such as eye, mouth, etc. using the Adaboost cascade object detector. Segmented components are divided in M × N regions and feature vector is obtained by concatenating local Haar features extracted from each region. Feature vector is projected in Linear Discriminant Analysis space to reduce its size. For classification, we used template matching (Chi-Square and Cosine measure) and machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine). Performance of proposed method is evaluated on various well-known data-sets like CK, Japanese Female Facial Expression, and Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database. Adaptability of the feature is also tested on in-house Web-Enabled Spontaneous Facial Expression Data-set (WESFED). Comparison with state of the art method shows the superiority of proposed method. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",classification; Facial expression recognition; Haar wavelet; logistic regression,Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Discriminant analysis; Image retrieval; Learning systems; Object detection; Regression analysis; Template matching; Vector spaces; Facial expression recognition; Feature extraction techniques; Haar wavelets; Linear discriminant analysis; Logistic regressions; Machine learning techniques; Recognition of facial expressions; State-of-the-art methods; Face recognition,"Goyani, M.; Department of Computer Engineering, Charotar University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: mahesh.goyani@gecmodasa.org",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1206212X,,IJCAF,,English,Int J Comput Appl,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050535773

Phishing attack continues to pose serious risk for web users and annoying threat in the field of electronic commerce. Feature selection is the process of removing unrelated features and thus reduces the dimensionality of the feature. This paper focuses on identifying the foremost features that categorise legitimate websites from phishing websites based on feature selection. In real world identifying phishing URL with low computational time and accuracy is very important and thus feature selection is considered in this work. A comparative study is carried out on different data mining classifiers before and after feature selection and the performance are evaluated in terms of accuracy and computational rate.

Supraglacial streams also act as a mode of transportation for sediments, solutes and other biotic and abiotic features. This study focuses on geospatial mapping of supraglacial streams from Schirmacher Oasis in Antarctica using high resolution optical satellite imagery. This could help advanced researches on the stream networks such as bathymetry study, hydrological studies etc. Supervised classification methods; Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and Mahalanobis distance classification (MDC) have been employed and accuracy has been assessed in different levels such as accuracy of few regions that undergone MLC, method-wise accuracy and finally length-wise accuracy assessment. It is seen that MLC is successful overall with average RMSE less than 5 m with a notable limitation of mapping only longer streams of an average length 350 m and above more accurately. Spectral mixing in the available data, presence of sediments, sun angle during data acquisition, streams being dry during most of the year etc., are some of the limitations faced during the study. A higher spectral resolution data or a combined classification system or both together can be employed for better results in the future. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

For efficient detection of Android malwares, different static and dynamic malware detection methods have been proposed. One of the popular methods of static detection technique is permission/feature-based detection of malwares through AndroidManifest.xml file using machine learning classifiers. But ignoring important feature or keeping irrelevant features may specifically cause mystification for classification algorithms. So to reduce classification time and improvement of accuracy different feature reduction tools have been used in different literature. In this work, we have proposed a framework that extracts the permission features of manifest files, generates feature vectors and uses six different feature ranking tools to create separate feature reducts. On those feature reducts different machine learning classifiers of Data Mining Tool, Weka have been used to classify android applications.

We create a hypothesis that social media websites are a rich source of information for mining these beliefs and automatically identifying the religious conflicts among users which overcomes the gaps of offline studies. In this paper, we address the challenge of ambiguity and multilingual scripts in social media posts and distinguish them into various religious sentiments of users. In order to evaluate our hypothesis, we conduct our study on Tumblr- the second most popular online micro-blogging service. We create a dataset of all Tumblr posts (published since 2007) consisting of several tags commonly used in religion based posts and make it publicly available for benchmarking and comparison. We investigate the efficiency of natural language based features for identifying the Tumblr posts that discuss about a religion and belong to one of the nine categories of users’ sentiments. For example, disagreement, defensive, annoyed and disappointment. We manually analyze these posts and our result shows the proposed features are discriminatory and support our hypothesis.

We need to do the job of classification automatically for faster and more accurate performance compared to manual process of classification. From the past study of work, we have developed the idea that features play an important role for discriminating different data types. A proper feature generates better accuracy of discrimination. So we have to choose features thoughtfully. Energy of speech signal and music signal (includes instrumental and song both) are not same. So we have used energy based features for our purpose. Zero crossing rates for speech and music is not same. This leads inclusion of Zero Crossing Rates (ZCR) based features in our feature set.

At unsignalized intersections, crossing drivers have to accept or reject the available gap. The gap acceptance decision is influenced by different dynamics such as traffic, geometric, environmental and human factors. The decision to cross the major road largely depends on the speed, distance and the heaviness of the potentially conflicting vehicle on the major road. The driver's gap acceptance data was collected at 4-legged unsignalized intersections. The information such as the type of crossing vehicle, conflicting vehicle, speed and the spatial gap was extracted from the video data. This paper deals with the application of three widely used non-parametric data mining techniques, namely, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RF) and Decision Trees (DT) to predict the gap acceptance behaviour of the driver. While SVMs are insensitive to class imbalance, decision tree generated by CART algorithm provides critical insights into decision making process employed by the driver. Random forests and decision tree implicitly establish the relative importance of different factors affecting the driver's decision. Further, skill scores used to validate the models revealed that SVM and DT models performed almost similarly whereas, RF model outperformed SVM and DT. © 2017 The Authors.

Raman University, Bilaspur, India","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to build a classification system which mimics the perceptual ability of human vision, in gathering knowledge about the structure, content and the surrounding environment of a real-world natural scene, at a quick glance accurately. This paper proposes a set of novel features to determine the gist of a given scene based on dominant color, dominant direction, openness and roughness features. Design/methodology/approach: The classification system is designed at two different levels. At the first level, a set of low level features are extracted for each semantic feature. At the second level the extracted features are subjected to the process of feature evaluation, based on inter-class and intra-class distances. The most discriminating features are retained and used for training the support vector machine (SVM) classifier for two different data sets. Findings: Accuracy of the proposed system has been evaluated on two data sets: the well-known Oliva-Torralba data set and the customized image data set comprising of high-resolution images of natural landscapes. The experimentation on these two data sets with the proposed novel feature set and SVM classifier has provided 92.68 percent average classification accuracy, using ten-fold cross validation approach. The set of proposed features efficiently represent visual information and are therefore capable of narrowing the semantic gap between low-level image representation and high-level human perception.

Knowledge about the location of obstruction site (V-Velum, O-Oropharyngeal lateral walls, T-Tongue, E-Epiglottis) in the upper airways is necessary for proper surgical treatment. In this paper we propose a dual source-filter model similar to the source-filter model of speech to approximate the generation process of snore audio. The first filter models the vocal tract from lungs to the point of obstruction with white noise excitation from the lungs. The second filter models the vocal tract from the obstruction point to the lips/nose with impulse train excitation which represents vibrations at the point of obstruction. The filter coefficients are estimated using the closed and open phases of the snore beat cycle. VOTE classification is done by using SVM classifier and filter coefficients as features. The classification experiments are performed on the development set (283 snore audios) of the MUNICH-PASSAU SNORE SOUND CORPUS (MPSSC).We obtain an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 49.58%, which is higher than the INTERSPEECH-2017 snoring sub-challenge baseline technique by -3% (absolute).

Satellite image classification problem has two major concerns to be addressed. The first issue is mixed pixel problem and the second issue is handling large amount of data present in these images. RBFNN function is an efficient network with a large set of tunable parameters. This network is able to generalize the results and is immune to noise. A RBFNN has learning ability and can appropriately react to unseen data. This makes the network a good choice for satellite images. The efficiency of RBFNN is greatly influenced by the learning algorithm and seed point selection. Therefore, in this paper spectral indices are used for seed selection and GA is used to train the network. The proposed method is used to classify the Landsat 8 OLI images of Dongting Lake in South China. The application of this method is shown for detection of flooded area over this region. The performance of the proposed method was analyzed and compared with three existing methods and the error matrix was computed to test the performance of the method. The method yields high producer's accuracy, consumer's accuracy and kappa coefficient value which indicated that the proposed classifier is highly effective and efficient. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Change detection; Classification; Genetic Algorithm; Landsat 8; Radial basis function,Classification (of information); Floods; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Radial basis function networks; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Supervised learning; Change detection; LANDSAT; Learning abilities; Radial basis function neural networks; Radial basis functions; Satellite image classification; Semi-supervised method; Tunable parameter; Image classification,"Singh, A.; The NorthCap UniversityIndia; email: akanshasing@gmail.com",,Academic Press Inc.,10473203,,JVCRE,,English,J Visual Commun Image Represent,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003756283

In this paper, we demonstrate that Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)-based clustering can be used to form an efficient representation of an image for a CBIC system.

Hiding the huge volume of data is practically difficult task among the researchers. Therefore, in real life only the sensitive data are hidden from the huge volume of data for providing security since hiding the entire data is costlier. Therefore, the sensitive attributes must be identified from the huge volume of data in order to hide them for preserving the privacy.

It is very difficult to understand these non-linear and non-stationary electrical flows through naked eye in the time domain. In specific, epilepsy seizures occur irregularly and un-predictively while recording EEG signal. Therefore, it demands a semi-Automatic tool in the framework of machine learning to understand these signals in general and to predict epilepsy seizure in specific. With this motivation, for wide and in-depth understanding of the EEG signal to detect epileptic seizure, this paper focus on the study of EEG signal through machine learning approaches. Neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) basically two fundamental components of machine learning techniques are the primary focus of this paper for classification of EEG signals to label epilepsy patients. The neural networks like multi-layer perceptron, probabilistic neural network, radial basis function neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are taken into consideration for empirical analysis on EEG signal to detect epilepsy seizure. Furthermore, for multi-layer neural networks different propagation training algorithms have been studied such as back-propagation, resilient-propagation, and quick-propagation. For SVM, several kernel methods were studied such as linear, polynomial, and RBF during empirical analysis. Finally, the study confirms with the present setting that, in all cases recurrent neural network performs poorly for the prepared epilepsy data.

Event extraction deals with finding more detailed biological phenomenon, which is more challenging compared to simple binary relation extraction like protein-protein interaction (PPI). The task can be thought of as comprising of the following sub-problems, viz., trigger detection, classification and argument extraction. Event trigger detection and classification deal with identification of event expressions from text and classification of them into nine different categories. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the base learning algorithm, which is trained with a diverse set of features that cover both statistical and linguistic characteristics. We develop a feature selection algorithm using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for determining the most relevant set of features.

In this paper, we propose a supervised learning-based novel algorithm to segment surveillance scenes with the help of high-level features extracted from object trajectories. High-level features are computed using a recently proposed nonoverlapping block-based representation of surveillance scene. We have trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to learn parameters describing the dynamics of a given surveillance scene. Experiments have been carried out using publicly available datasets and the outcomes suggest that, the proposed methodology can deliver encouraging results for correctly segmenting surveillance with the help of motion trajectories. We have compared the method with state-of-the-art techniques.

Identification of PDR requires modeling of these unregulated ill-formed vessels, and other associated signs of PDR. We present an approach that models the micro-pattern of local variations (using texture based analysis) and quantifies structural changes in vessel patterns in localized patches, to arrive at a score of neovascularity. The distribution of patch-level confidence scores is collated into an image-level decision of presence or absence of PDR. Evaluated on a dataset of 779 images combining public data and clinical data from local hospitals, the patch-level neovascularity prediction has a sensitivity of 92.4% at 92.6% specificity. For image-level PDR identification our method is shown to achieve sensitivity of 83.3% at a high specificity operating point of 96.1% specificity, and specificity of 83% at high sensitivity operating point of 92.2% sensitivity. Our approach could have potential application in DR grading where it can localize NVE regions and identify PDR images for immediate intervention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Computer-assisted screening; Evaluation; Texture,"Classification (of information); Eye protection; Grading; Textures; Computer assisted; Diabetic retinopathy; Evaluation; High sensitivity; Local variations; Neo-vascularization; Operating points; Retinal fundus images; Image processing; anatomical concepts; Article; classifier; comparative study; diagnostic test accuracy study; eye fundus; fundus camera; human; image analysis; neovascularization (pathology); optic disk; power spectrum; prediction; priority journal; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; retina blood vessel; retina image; sensitivity and specificity; texture based analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic imaging; neovascularization (pathology); procedures; Diabetic Retinopathy; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Sensitivity and Specificity","Ram, K.; Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre, IIT MadrasIndia; email: keerthi@htic.iitm.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,8956111,,CMIGE,27634547,English,Comput.

This paper addresses the major challenges in the data stream classification with recurring concept drift. We developed a novel classification method known as Pearson Guassian Naïve Bayes classification (PGNBC). The proposed PGNBC method is the advancement over the existing Guassian Naïve Bayes classifier (GNBC) by additionally adding the correlation among the attributes. For the data stream classification, the proposed PGNBC is frequently updated based on the concept drift. This newly developed method is experimented by comparing the results with the existing methods such as RGNBC and MReC-DFS. The metrics such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are used for measuring the performance. It is found that the improvement in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values are better for the proposed method, with the values of 4%, 1% and 1% respectively, which is higher for the PGNBC method than the RGNBC method for the skin data. But with the localization data, the improvement in terms of specificity and accuracy values are 6% and 2% respectively which is higher than the RGNBC. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

In this work, we have generated classification models by using the inhibition data set of known PTP1B inhibitors to identify new inhibitors of PTP1B utilizing multiple machine learning techniques like naïve Bayesian, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors, along with structural fingerprints and selected molecular descriptors. Several models from each algorithm have been constructed and optimized, with the different combination of molecular descriptors and structural fingerprints. For the training and test sets, most of the predictive models showed more than 90% of overall prediction accuracies. The best model was obtained with support vector machine approach and has Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.82 for the external test set, which was further employed for the virtual screening of Maybridge small compound database. Five compounds were subsequently selected for experimental assay. Out of these two compounds were found to inhibit PTP1B with significant inhibitory activity in in-vitro inhibition assay. The structural fragments which are important for PTP1B inhibition were identified by naïve Bayesian method and can be further exploited to design new molecules around the identified scaffolds. The descriptive and predictive modeling strategy applied in this study is capable of identifying PTP1B inhibitors from the large compound libraries. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; Structure fragments; Support vector machine; Type-2 diabetes; Virtual screening,"Amino acids; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Phosphatases; Proteins; Support vector machines; Classification models; Correlation coefficient; Large compound libraries; Molecular descriptors; Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; Structural fragments; Type-2 diabetes; Virtual Screening; Learning systems; btb 12807; insulin receptor; jfd 02644; jfd 02789; jfd 03705; phosphopeptide; protein tyrosine phosphatase; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor; sb 01794sc; suramin; unclassified drug; insulin; leptin; protein binding; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; PTPN1 protein, human; Article; Bayesian learning; clinical classification; controlled study; correlation coefficient; data base; drug identification; enzyme inhibition; finger dermatoglyphics; human; in vitro study; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; mathematical model; molecular docking; naive bayesian; priority journal; random forest; support vector machine; workflow; antagonists and inhibitors; Bayes theorem; chemistry; drug effects; genetics; machine learning; molecular library; molecular model; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; signal transduction; therapeutic use; Bayes Theorem; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Insulin; Leptin; Machine Learning; Models, Molecular; Obesity; Protein Binding; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1; Signal Transduction; Small Molecule Libraries","Siddiqi, M.I.; Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research InstituteIndia",,Elsevier Inc.,10933263,,JMGMF,28006676,English,J.

A popular diagnostic method involves histopathological microscopy imaging, which can be augmented by automated image analysis. In histopathology image analysis, stain normalization is an important procedure of color transfer between a source (reference) and the test image, that helps in addressing an important concern of stain color variation. In this work, we hypothesize that if color-texture information is well captured with suitable features using data containing sufficient color variation, it may obviate the need for stain normalization. Considering that such an image analysis study is relatively less explored, some questions are yet unresolved such as (a) How can texture and color information be effectively extracted and used for classification so as to reduce the burden on the uniform staining or stain normalization. (b) Are there good feature-classifier combinations which work consistently across all magnifications? (c) Can there be an automated way to select reference image for stain normalization? In this work, we attempt to address such questions. In the process, we compare the independent texture and color channel information with that of some more sophisticated features which consider jointly color-texture information. We have extracted above features using images with and without stain normalization to validate the above hypothesis. Moreover, we also compare different types of contemporary classification in conjunction with the above features. Based on the results of our exhaustive experimentation we provide some useful indications. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Color-texture features; Histopathology image analysis; Random forest; Stain normalization; SVM,Automation; Classification (of information); Color; Color image processing; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Endoscopy; Image analysis; Image classification; Image processing; Medical imaging; Robotics; Automated classification; Automated image analysis; Color texture features; Color-texture information; Feature classifiers; Histopathological microscopy; Random forests; Stain normalization; Image texture,"Gupta, V.; Indian Institute of Technology MandiIndia; email: vibha_gupta@students.iitmandi.ac.in",Arbel T.Cardoso M.J.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Through extensive simulations we illustrate this robustness. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Decision trees; Label noise; Robust learning,Classification (of information); Convex optimization; Data mining; Decision trees; Optimization; Classifier learning; Decision tree learning; Decision tree learning algorithm; Extensive simulations; Nonconvex optimization; Practical problems; Robust learning; Sample complexity; Learning algorithms,"Sastry, P.S.; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: sastry@ee.iisc.ernet.in",Shim K.Lee J.-G.Cao L.Lin X.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

These techniques involve high computational burden in training phase, to separate samples from distinct classes, for active learning. In active learning paradigm, system first returns a small image set. Inference is drawn from this image set based on relevance as per user perception. Hence image retrieval based on context suffers in terms of precision and recall, as retraining and interactive time response is involved. A classifier known as Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) reduces this computational overhead by transforming the problem of classification as a graph obtained from dataset samples in feature space. It involves fast computation of trees built through the forest classifier in a graph resulting from training dataset samples. An optimum path is conquered from least cost approximation of a shortest path through the current prototype sample to the image under consideration. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Active learning; Forest classifier; Image retrieval; Minimum spanning tree,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Diagnosis; Face recognition; Forestry; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Image classification; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Search engines; Active Learning; Computational burden; Computational overheads; Content based image retrieval systems; Forest classifiers; Minimum spanning trees; Pattern recognition techniques; Precision and recall; Image retrieval,"Dhawale, S.; Department of Information Technology, Maharashtra Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: shrikantdhwl7@gmail.com",Bhateja V.Satapathy S.C.Joshi A.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Methods The classification technique is based on shape, texture and color features. It classifies the cervical dysplasia into two-level (normal and abnormal) and three-level (Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) classes reflecting the established Bethesda system of classification used for diagnosis of cancerous or precancerous lesion of cervix. The system is evaluated on two generated databases obtained from two diagnostic centers, one containing 1610 single cervical cells and the other 1320 complete smear level images. The main objective of this database generation is to categorize the images according to the Bethesda system of classification both of which require lots of training and expertise. The system is also trained and tested on the benchmark Herlev University database which is publicly available. In this contribution a new segmentation technique has also been proposed for extracting shape features. Ripplet Type I transform, Histogram first order statistics and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix have been used for color and texture features respectively. To improve classification results, ensemble method is used, which integrates the decision of three classifiers. Assessments are performed using 5 fold cross validation. Results Extended experiments reveal that the proposed system can successfully classify Pap smear images performing significantly better when compared with other existing methods. Conclusion This type of automated cancer classifier will be of particular help in early detection of cancer. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Ensemble classification; MSER; Pap smear; Ripplet transform,Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Database systems; Diseases; Intelligent systems; Automatic categorization; Classification technique; Color and texture features; Ensemble classification; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; MSER; Pap smear; Ripplet transforms; Image classification; Article; automation; classification; data base; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early cancer diagnosis; female; highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion; human; human cell; image analysis; image display; imaging; malignancy low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; negative for intraepithelial lesion; Papanicolaou test; sensitivity and specificity; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix dysplasia; database management system; reproducibility; support vector machine; Uterine Cervical Dysplasia; vagina smear; Automation; Database Management Systems; Female; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Support Vector Machine; Uterine Cervical Dysplasia; Vaginal Smears,"Bora, K.; Department of Centre for Computational and Numerical Sciences, Institute of Advanced Study in Science and TechnologyIndia; email: kangkana.bora89@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,27886713,English,Comput.

Ramaiah Institute of Technology, An Autonomous Institute, Affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Bangalore, Karnataka  560054, India","Feature selection is critical for effective analysis of data and resource savings. In multi-dimensional datasets, feature selection methods mainly use filter based approach to obtain an optimal feature subspace and wrapper methods to search for an optimal feature subset within this space. In the proposed study, two filter based statistical feature selection methods viz., statistical t-test ranking with principal component analysis (PCA) and Separability & Correlation (SEPCOR) analysis are applied to identify patterns with high discrimination between wake and stage 1 sleep of a 8-channel (6 active +2 reference electrodes) electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep dataset. The feature set consists of 6-dimensional Spectral Entropy vectors computed over EEG epochs of one second duration. In the first method, spectral entropy feature ranking is based on a t-test statistic that maximizes class separation between wakefulness/stage1 sleep. Prior to classification, PCA is performed on the ranked and non-ranked feature subsets to study the contribution of ranked channels on classifier performance. The second method uses SEPCOR analysis to automatically select an optimal feature subset with low correlation among the chosen features and maximum separation between their class means. A correlation threshold is chosen heuristically in steps of 0.05 from 0.6 to 0.75 in order to select different subsets of features. The optimal feature subsets are evaluated using multi layered perceptron (MLP) network & k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers with 50% hold out cross validation. For ranked feature subsets N = 3, 4, 5, k-NN classifier outperforms MLP network with an increase in the number of principal components (pcs). Results indicate that the pcs of ranked channels enhance the performance of k-NN classifier whereas MLP network shows only a marginal improvement with ranking for number of channels, N ?? 4. As the number of pcs is varied from 2 to 4 in steps of one, there is an improvement of approximately 2% in the classification accuracies of k-NN classifier with ranking as compared to their non-ranked counterparts. The MLP exhibits only 1% improvement with ranking for the same case with number of hidden neurons, N = 50. The k-NN classifier responds with maximum accuracies of 96.43%, 95.7% and 94.10% (pc = ?4, 3, 2 for no. of ranked channels, N = 4) as compared to 94.71%, 93.13% and 92% (pc = 4, 3, 2 non-ranked N = 4) respectively. The SEPCOR results show that with correlation threshold increasing from 0.6 to 0.75 in steps of 0.05, it automatically selects feature subsets of 2, 3, 4 and 5 which contribute to detection accuracies of 72.4%, 80%, 91.6% and 92% with k-NN classifier and improved accuracies of 73%, 85%, 95.6% and 95.8% with MLP network (no. of hidden neurons, N = 50) respectively. The SE feature ranking provides better classification results using k-NN classifier than non-ranked cases whereas features obtained using SEPCOR analysis prove to be better discriminators with MLP network for the classification of wake/stage1 sleep data. The computation speed is faster in k-NN classifier and independent of increase in value of k whereas MLP takes much more computation time for training based on the number of hidden neurons. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Electroencephalogram (EEG); k-Nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers; Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network; Principal component analysis (PCA); Separability & correlation (SEPCOR); Spectral entropy; t-Test,Bioelectric phenomena; Biomedical signal processing; Electroencephalography; Entropy; Feature extraction; Microcomputers; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Neurons; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Set theory; Sleep research; Spectrum analysis; Statistical tests; Text processing; Wakes; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); K-nearest neighbors; Multilayer perceptron neural networks; Spectral entropy; T-tests; Classification (of information); alpha rhythm; Article; beta rhythm; brain function; comparative study; electroencephalogram; electromyogram; entropy; gamma rhythm; human; human experiment; k nearest neighbor; normal human; pattern recognition; perceptron; polysomnography; principal component analysis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; separability and correlation analysis; sleep pattern; sleep stage; sleep waking cycle; statistical analysis; Student t test; wakefulness,"Sriraam, N.; M.S.

These distorted waveforms are composed of different frequency components and which are needed to be represented in time-frequency domain for fault analysis. For this representation of signal, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is presented. It extracts the features and forms the datasets which are forwarded to ANFIS classifier for classifying the type of fault occurred in the distributed power systems.

Critical success factor for content based recognition process has been reliant on efficient feature vector extraction from images. The paper has introduced two novel techniques of feature extraction based on image binarization and Vector Quantization respectively. The techniques were implemented to extract feature vectors from three public datasets namely Wang dataset, Oliva and Torralba (OT-Scene) dataset and Corel dataset comprising of 14,488 images on the whole. The classification decisions with multi domain features were standardized with Z score normalization for fusion based identification approach.

Efficient AUC optimization is a challenging research problem as the objective function is non-decomposable and non-continuous. Using a max-margin based surrogate loss function, AUC optimization problem can be approximated as a pairwise RankSVM learning problem. Batch learning algorithms for solving the kernelized version of this problem suffer from scalability issues. Therefore, recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the development of online or single-pass algorithms that design a nonlinear classifier by maximizing the AUC performance. However, on many real-world datasets, the AUC performance of these classifiers was observed to be inferior to that of the classifiers designed using batch learning algorithms. Further, many practical imbalanced data classification problems demand fast inference, which underlines the need for designing sparse nonlinear classifiers. Motivated by these observations, we design a scalable algorithm for maximizing the AUC performance by greedily adding the required number of basis functions into the classifier model. The resulting sparse classifier performs faster inference and its AUC performance is comparable with that of the classifier designed using batch mode. Our experimental results show that the level of sparsity achievable can be an order of magnitude larger than that achieved by the Kernel RankSVM model without significantly affecting the AUC performance.

Even though many physicochemical parameters are available for monitoring the water quality, the knowledge of domain experts are expected to analyze these parameters to find the final decision about the quality of water. In order to utilize the knowledge of the domain experts for water quality artificially, we have developed a functional tangent decision tree algorithm which, predict the water quality of the ponds based on the physiochemical parameters. The proposed method of predicting the water quality consists of three important steps such as, uncertainty handling, feature selection using reduct and core analysis, classification using the functional tangent decision tree. The proposed functional tangent decision tree is constructed by utilizing a new function called functional tangent entropy for the selection of attributes and split points. Then, the proposed work is experimented with the real database and compared with the existing classifiers to prove its better performance. The proposed work obtained the maximum classification accuracy of 95 as compared with the existing work. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

In such applications, the processing time in finding whether the moving images can be registered with fixed image constitute an overhead. Hence we have approached the problem by trying to predict if the given SAR images can be registered or not even without registering them.

This can be achieved with the regular screening of patients known to have Diabetes for 5 years or more. Once detected with DR, it is important for doctors to maintain the progress of the disease down the line. This includes identification and marking of DR features in the fundus images. Manual marking of DR features like exudates and hemorrhages is tedious and error prone job for opthalmologists. Detection of DR is widely done with fundus imaging technique. To help aid ophthalmologists, the DR features in fundus images can be automatically marked using machine learning algorithms [1]. In this paper, a novel and generalized method for segmenting the fundus images is proposed. With our approach, retinal color images are partitioned into non-overlapping segments covering the entire image. Each segment, i.e., splat, contains pixels with similar color and spatial location. A novel method for automated generalised generation of splat is presented in this paper and further marking of the diseased splats is also proposed.

For this purpose, a feature selection scheme is integrated with the classical supervised classifiers like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, separately to improve the classification performance, named as Integrated Classifiers. Here feature selection scheme generates bootstrap samples that are used to create diverse and informative features using Principal Component Analysis. Thereafter, such features are multiplied with the original data in order create training and testing data for the classifiers. Final classification results are obtained on test data by computing posterior probability. The performance of the proposed integrated classifiers with respect to their conventional classifiers is demonstrated on 12 microarray datasets. The results show that the integrated classifiers boost the performance up to 25.90% for a dataset, while the average performance gain is 9.74%, over the conventional classifiers.

Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India","Purpose: Current practices in data classification and retrieval have experienced a surge in the use of multimedia content. Identification of desired information from the huge image databases has been facing increased complexities for designing an efficient feature extraction process. Conventional approaches of image classification with text-based image annotation have faced assorted limitations due to erroneous interpretation of vocabulary and huge time consumption involved due to manual annotation. Content-based image recognition has emerged as an alternative to combat the aforesaid limitations. However, exploring rich feature content in an image with a single technique has lesser probability of extract meaningful signatures compared to multi-technique feature extraction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of enhanced content-based image recognition by fusion of classification decision obtained using diverse feature extraction techniques. Design/methodology/approach: Three novel techniques of feature extraction have been introduced in this paper and have been tested with four different classifiers individually. The four classifiers used for performance testing were K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, RIDOR classifier, artificial neural network classifier and support vector machine classifier. Thereafter, classification decisions obtained using KNN classifier for different feature extraction techniques have been integrated by Z-score normalization and feature scaling to create fusion-based framework of image recognition. It has been followed by the introduction of a fusion-based retrieval model to validate the retrieval performance with classified query. Earlier works on content-based image identification have adopted fusion-based approach. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, fusion-based query classification has been addressed for the first time as a precursor of retrieval in this work. Findings: The proposed fusion techniques have successfully outclassed the state-of-the-art techniques in classification and retrieval performances.

Various SV systems are developed following the idea-level collaboration with two other Indian institutions. Unlike the previous SREs, this time the focus was on developing SV system using non-target language speech data and a small amount unlabeled data from target language/ dialects. For addressing these novel challenges, we tried exploring the fusion of systems created using different features, data conditioning, and classifiers. On NIST 2016 SRE evaluation data, the presented fused system resulted in actual detection cost function (actDCF) and equal error rate (EER) of 0:81 and 12:91%, respectively. Post-evaluation, we explored a recently proposed pairwise support vector machine classifier and applied adaptive S-norm to the decision scores before fusion. With these changes, the final system achieves the actDCF and EER of 0:67 and 11:63%, respectively.

Analysis of gene expression data arising from these experiments provides insight into different subtypes of diseases and functions of genes. Gene expression data are characterized by a large number of genes and a few samples. Employing traditional supervised classifiers for prediction requires adequate labeled data. However, the limited number of samples make the prediction of disease subtypes a difficult task. Hence, we investigate the potential of semi-supervised learning to delineate the tissue samples from a few labeled data. The available labeled samples were exploited to guide the clustering of unlabeled samples. A classification system by integrating feature selection techniques with semi-supervised fuzzy c-means algorithm was built. The system was evaluated using publicly available gene expression datasets and results showed that a few labeled tissue samples can assist in the accurate prediction of disease subtypes. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Popularity of social network provides a statistical way to predict the upcoming and outgoing fashion trends through social content data analysis. Social image data is a most expressive form of content data which is useful to get the fashion related information. But, characteristics of social data such as heterogeneity, large volume, etc. make this problem challenging. Hence, in this paper semi-supervised feature extraction and classification model is proposed based on the joint probability of multiple features. We conducted experiments on Fashion 10000 dataset [1] having images from Flickr. First, feature extraction is done where Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based matching points (using labelled and unlabelled images) along with five other features i.e. color, texture, regional, geometric and face detection (using unlabelled image) are obtained. Due to the consideration of multiple significant features, proposed approach is able to deal with the heterogeneity in given images. Linear convolution is performed to get the representative image with prominent features and it is compared with labelled representative images of each class to get the number of matching points for that class. Color and texture features are extracted with the help of RGB components and gray level co-occurrence matrix, respectively. Values of extent, eccentricity and orientation are considered as regional features and Euler number as geometric feature. As most of the social images with person consist fashion related information, face detection is also carried out to show the presence of person in given image and stored it as a feature. Then, class-conditional probabilities of all the extracted features are computed and the maximum joint probability is used while assigning the class label to the given image. Obtained results show that incorporation of matching points using CNN with other features, improves the accuracy than using only other five features. In [2], search based classification using twelve global features is carried out by B. Loni et al. on same fashion dataset where 0.7421 f1-score for visual only method is obtained. Using only six features, approximately similar results are achieved with our proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Classification; Fashion images; Feature extraction; Social data,Color matching; Convolution; Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Learning systems; Neural networks; Probability; Textile industry; Color and texture features; Conditional probabilities; Convolutional neural network; Fashion images; Feature extraction and classification; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Linear convolution; Social datum; Classification (of information),"Wazarkar, S.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: wazarkarseema@nitgoa.ac.in",Lintas A.Villa A.E.Rovetta S.Verschure P.F.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Such applications demand prediction models with small storage and computational complexity that do not compromise significantly on accuracy. In this work, we propose ProtoNN, a novel algorithm that addresses the problem of real-time and accurate prediction on resource-scarce devices. ProtoNN is inspired by k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) but has several orders lower storage and prediction complexity. ProtoNN models can be deployed even on devices with puny storage and computational power (e.g. An Arduino UNO with 2kB RAM) to get excellent prediction accuracy. ProtoNN derives its strength from three key ideas: a) learning a small number of prototypes to represent the entire training set, b) sparse low dimensional projection of data, c) joint discriminative learning of the projection and prototypes with explicit model size constraint. Wc conduct systematic empirical evaluation of ProtoNN on a variety of supervised learning tasks (binary, multi-class, multi-label classification) and show that it gives nearly state-of-the-art prediction ac-curacy on resource-scarce devices while consuming several orders lower storage, and using minimal working memory.

A number of high performing texture algorithms are based on the concept of local binary patterns (LBP) characterising the relationships of pixels to their local neighbourhood. LBP descriptors are simple to calculate, are invariant to intensity changes and can be calculated in a rotation invariant manner as well as at different scales. Incorporating variance information, leading to LBP variance (LBPV) texture descriptors, has been claimed to lead to more versatile and more effective texture features. In this paper, we investigate this in more detail, benchmarking and contrasting the classification performance of several LBP and LBPV descriptors for generic image texture classification as well as two medical tasks.

Attributes that affect the road accident can be road attribute, environment attributes, traffic attributes etc. Analyzing road accident can provide the information about the contribution of these attributes which can be utilized to overcome the accident rate. Nowadays, Data mining is a popular technique for examining the road accident dataset. In this study, we have performed the classification of road accident on the basis of road user category. We have used Self Organizing map (SOM), K-modes clustering technique to group the data into homogeneous segments and then applied Support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and Decision tree to classify the data. We have performed classification on data with and without clustering. The result illustrates that better classification accuracy can be achieved after segmentation of data using clustering. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Accident analysis; Classification; Clustering; Data mining,Accidents; Artificial intelligence; Barium compounds; Classification (of information); Conformal mapping; Decision trees; Highway accidents; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Self organizing maps; Support vector machines; Transportation; Trees (mathematics); Accident analysis; Accident rate; Classification accuracy; Clustering; Clustering techniques; k-Modes; Naive bayes; Road users; Data mining,"Tiwari, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National University of Science and Technology MisisRussian Federation; email: prayagforms@gmail.com",Mandal J.K.Dutta P.Mukhopadhyay S.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

To reduce the intensity of the work of doctors, pre-classification work needs to be issued and in this paper, related liver microscopic image classification analysis was proposed. Firstly, the extraction methods of mice liver images were taken using different features for different image features, and secondly, image features were obtained to form the original data-set; finally, the image classification experiments were conducted using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and a developed support vector machine (SVM). The best classification model derived from the established characteristics is that GLCM performed the highest accuracy of classification; the training model using 11 features was accurately that only trained by 8 GLCMs. The experimental results preliminarily verified the feasibility of the method used in the experiment of classifying liver microscopic images of mice, and laid the foundation for further construction of computer aided diagnosis system. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

The view-invariant features are obtained from clouds of varying temporal scale by extracting holistic features, which are modeled to explicitly take advantage of the global, spatial and temporal distribution of interest points. The proposed view-invariant features are highly discriminative and robust for recognizing actions as the view changes. This paper proposes a mechanism for real world application which can follow the actions of a person in a video based on image sequences and can separate these actions according to given training data. Using the proposed mechanism, the beginning and ending of an action sequence can be labeled automatically without the need for manual setting. It is not necessary in the proposed approach to re-train the system if there are changes in scenario, which means the trained database can be applied in a wide variety of environments.

Having too many ordinary but too few rare samples as training data, will mislead the classifier to become over-fitted by learning too much from majority class samples and become under-fitted lacking recognizing power for minority class samples. In this research work, a novel rebalancing technique that under-samples (reduce by sampling) the majority class size for subsiding the imbalanced class distributions without synthesizing extra training samples, is studied. This simple method is called Similarity Majority Under-Sampling Technique (SMUTE). By measuring the similarity between each majority class sample and its surrounding minority class samples, SMUTE effectively discriminates the majority and minority class samples with consideration of not changing too much of the underlying non-linear mapping between the input variables and the target classes. Two experiments are conducted and reported in this paper: one is an extensive performance comparison of SMUTE with the states-of-the-arts using generated imbalanced data; the other is the use of real data representing a case of natural disaster prevention where accident samples are rare.

Numerous methodologies incorporating image processing were improved to tackle this process for early stage recognition of diseases. Leaf recognition has popular/wide range of agriculture practical applications. Consequently, the current work is interested in the recognition and classification of parsley and basil leaves along with the recognition of their infected parts. An image analysis is used to extract different statistical features from the leaves' dataset. From such statistical features a recognition/classification processes are performed to classify the fresh and infected leaves in each leaf type as well as to classify the two-leave species. The classification process was performed using neural network. The experimental results depicted that the classification accuracies for the three tested cases, namely fresh/infected basil, fresh/infected parsley, and fresh basil/parsley were 80%, 80.0%, and 100.0%; respectively. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Early detection and treatment of this CAD condition is essential and may help in preventing it from progressing further. However, faster and accurate identification of CAD from Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using manual interpretations is not an easy task to achieve. Thus, computer-aided techniques are necessary for the automated characterization of CAD condition. Therefore, this work proposes application of Higher-Order Statistics and Spectra (HOS) for an automated classification of normal and CAD conditions using ECG signals. In this paper, 182,013 beats (137,587 normal beats and 44,426 beats with CAD) ECG beats are used. HOS bispectrum and cumulant features are extracted from each ECG beat. The features extracted are applied to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimension reduction technique. Then PCA coefficients are ranked using Bhattacharyya method, entropy, fuzzy Max-Relevancy and Min-Redundancy (mRMR), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), t-test, Wilcoxon ranking methods. All ranked features are subjected to k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to obtain the highest classification performance. The proposed methodology has achieved 98.17% accuracy, 94.57% sensitivity, and 99.34% specificity, using KNN classifier using 13 bispectrum features. Similarly, we have obtained 98.99% average accuracy, 97.75% sensitivity, and 99.39% specificity using DT classifier with 31 cumulant features. In addition, we have formulated and developed an integrated index called Coronary Artery Disease Index (CADI) for automated characterization of normal and ECG signals with CAD condition using a single number. This proposed CADI works efficiently to discriminate normal and CAD ECG classes for the any dataset with priory knowledge of the database. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Bispectrum; Coronary artery disease; Cumulant; Electrocardiogram; Higher-order-spectra,Automation; Cardiology; Characterization; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Heart; Higher order statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Principal component analysis; Radar target recognition; Bispectrum; Classification performance; Coronary artery disease; Cumulants; Dimension reduction techniques; Higher order spectrum; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Receiver operating characteristics; Biomedical signal processing; Article; cardiovascular disease assessment; classifier; computer aided design; coronary artery disease; Coronary Artery Disease Index; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; electrocardiogram; entropy; fuzzy system; higher order statistics and spectra; human; k nearest neighbor; normal human; principal component analysis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; Student t test; Wilcoxon signed ranks test,"Sudarshan, V.K.; Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann PolytechnicSingapore; email: vidya.2kus@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,17468094,,,,English,Biomed.

Current research considers utterances as independent entities, i.e., ignores the inter-dependencies and relations among the utterances of a video. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-based model that enables utterances to capture contextual information from their surroundings in the same video, thus aiding the classification process. Our method shows 5-10% performance improvement over the state of the art and high robustness to generalizability. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Computational linguistics; Data mining; Linguistics; Long short-term memory; Classification process; Context dependent; Contextual information; High robustness; Inter-dependencies; Sentiment analysis; State of the art; User-generated video; Classification (of information),,,Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL),,9.78195E+12,,,English,"ACL - Annu.
