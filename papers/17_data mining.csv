The Association rule mining has many research challenges. The generation of accurate frequent and infrequent itemset by reducing the candidate itemset and reducing the space in the memory is one of the challenges. The generation of positive and negative association rule with high confidence and high quality is another challenge. The next research challenge is to mine an optimized positive and negative association rule. Numerous existing algorithms have been used to overcome these challenges but many such algorithms cause data loss, lack of efficiency and accuracy which also results in redundant rules and loss of space in memory. The major issue in using this analytic optimizing method is specifying the activist initialization limit were the quality of the association rule relays on. In the Proposed work, it is proved that an efficient optimized Positive and negative association rule can be mined by the proposed Advance ABC algorithm. The advance ABC (Artificial Bee Colony) algorithm is swarm intelligence based algorithm highly efficient optimization algorithm. The Advance ABC Meta heuristic technique is stimulated through the natural food foraging behaviour of the honey bee creature. The result shows that the proposed algorithm can mine incredibly high confidence non redundant positive and negative association rule with less time. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",Accurate multi level and multi support; Advanceabcalgorithm; Apriori algorithm; Association rule mining; Data mining; GPNAR,,,,Asian Research Publishing Network,19928645,,,,English,J.

Several data structures and heuristic methods have been proposed in the literature to efficiently mine high utility itemsets. This paper advances the state-of-the-art and presents HMiner, a high utility itemset mining method. HMiner utilizes a few novel ideas and presents a compact utility list and virtual hyperlink data structure for storing itemset information. It also makes use of several pruning strategies for efficiently mining high utility itemsets. The proposed ideas were evaluated on a set of benchmark sparse and dense datasets. The execution time improvements ranged from a modest thirty percent to three orders of magnitude across several benchmark datasets. The memory consumption requirements also showed up to an order of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. In general, HMiner was found to work well in the dense regions of both sparse and dense benchmark datasets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Data mining; Frequent itemset mining; High utility mining,Data mining; Data structures; Hypertext systems; Benchmark datasets; Frequent itemset mining; High utility itemset minings; High utility itemsets; Memory consumption; State-of-the-art methods; Three orders of magnitude; Utility mining; Heuristic methods,,,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027585254

Particularly assessing reusability extent of the software components can enable efficient software design. The probability of aging proneness can be characterized based on key OO-SM like cohesion, coupling and complexity of a software component. In this paper, aging resilient software reusability prediction model is proposed for object oriented design based Web of Service (WoS) software systems. This work introduces multilevel optimization to accomplish a novel reusability prediction model. Considering coupling, cohesion and complexity as the software characteristics to signify aging proneness, six CK metrics; WMC, CBO, DIT, LCOM, NOC, and RFC are obtained from 100 WoS software. The extracted CK metrics are processed for min–max normalization that alleviates data-unbalancing and hence avoids saturation during learning. The 10-fold Cross-validation followed by outlier detection is considered to enrich data quality for further feature extraction. To reduce computational overheads RSA algorithm is applied. SoftAudit tool is applied to estimate reusability of each class, while binary ULR estimates calculates (reuse proneness) threshold. Applying different classification algorithms such as LM, ANN algorithms, ELM, and evolutionary computing enriched ANN reuse-proneness prediction has been done. The performance assessment affirms that AGA based ANN model outperforms other techniques and hence can be used for earlier aging-resilient reusability optimization for WoS software design. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Aging-resilient; ANN; Evolutionary computing; Software reusability prediction; Web of Service,Adhesion; Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Object oriented programming; Optimization; Reusability; Software design; Web services; 10-fold cross-validation; Classification algorithm; Computational overheads; Evolutionary computing; Multilevel optimization; Performance assessment; Software characteristic; Web of Service; Computer software reusability,"Padhy, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sri Satya Sai University of Technology and Medical Science (SSSUTM)India; email: neelamadhabphd@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039729883

Hence, everyone tends to express their opinions on social media or e-commerce websites about commercial products, movies, sports, social and geopolitical matters and even on government policies. These opinions reflect the corresponding person's view or sentiment about that particular matter, which ultimately leads to the formation of opinion polarity regarding a specific issue. In today's context, Twitter, Facebook or other social platforms often witness a lot of opinion waves regarding some of the today's most hot topics, and one of them surely is the introduction of Goods and Services Tax or GST in India. The rising sentiment analysis and opinion mining regarding this issue is helping researchers to understand the insight of public emotion. It can be also implemented to gain an idea of allover opinion polarity of people in this matter.

Chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSO) has been widely applied to feature selection because of its efficiency and effectiveness. However, since feature selection is a challenging task with a complex search space, CSO quickly gets stuck the local minimum problem. This paper aims to improve the CSO searching ability by applying logistic and tend chaotic maps to assist the CSO swarm in exploring the search space better. The proposed chaotic chicken swarm algorithm (CCSO)-based feature selection algorithm is compared with four feature selection algorithms on five benchmark data sets. A comparison among several types of popular classifiers is done to figure out the sensitivity of each classifier corresponding to the selected features and the dimension reduction. During iterations, the best fitness value shows remarkable improvement of the classification accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",bio inspired swarm algorithm; Chaotic chicken swarm; chaotic maps; Feature selection; optimized supervised feature selection model; wrapper algorithm,Animals; Artificial intelligence; Chaotic systems; Classification (of information); Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Lyapunov methods; Optimization; Chaotic chicken swarm; Chaotic map; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Complex search spaces; Feature selection algorithm; Swarm algorithms; Swarm optimization algorithms; Feature extraction,,Piuri V.Mukherjee A.Mondal A.Das A.Maulik U.Bhattacharjee D.Bhaumik H.Panigrahi B.K.Gandhi T.Bhattacharyya S.Pan I.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The knowledge obtained from education helps to enhance opportunities in one's employment development. To extract useful information from the knowledge obtained, Educational Data Mining is widely used. Educational data mining provides the process of applying different data mining tools and techniques to analyze and visualize the data of an institution (school) and can be used to discover a unique pattern of students' academic performance and behavior. The present work intends to enhance students' academic performance in secondary school using data mining techniques. Real data was collected using school reports and questionnaire method by the Portugal school which has been used in this paper. Naive Bayesian algorithm can be easily implemented to predict the students' academic performance and behavior. Classification of students into two classes, pass and fail, involves training phase and testing phase. In training phase, Naive Bayes classifier is built and in the testing phase, Naive Bayes classifier is used to make the prediction. The accuracy of the classifier is calculated using WEKA tool in which confusion matrix is generated. The accuracy of the classifier obtained is 87% which can be further improved by the selection of appropriate attributes. Developing the classification algorithms in this way helps to obtain a more efficient student performance predictor tool using other data mining algorithms and it also helps to improve the quality of education in an educational institution. © 2017 IEEE.",Educational Data Mining; Naive Bayes Classifier; WEKA,Classifiers; Learning systems; Students; Classification algorithm; Data mining algorithm; Educational data mining; Educational institutions; Naive Bayes classifiers; Naive Bayesian algorithms; Quality of education; WEKA; Data mining,,Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proceeding - IEEE Int.

The eminent need of mining is useful to extract the hidden pattern from the wide availability of vast amount of data. Clustering is one such useful mining tool to handle this unfavorable situation by carrying out crucial steps refers as cluster analysis. It is the process of a grouping of patterns into clusters based on similarity. Partition based clustering algorithms are widely accepted for much diverse application such as pattern analysis, image segmentation, identification system. Among the different variations of the partition based clustering, due to its monotony and ease of implementation K-means algorithm gained a lot of attraction in the various field of research. A severe problem associated with the algorithm is that it is highly sophisticated while selecting the initial centroid and may converge to a local optimum solution of the criterion function value if the initial centroid is not chosen accurately. Additionally, it requires the prior information regarding a number of clusters to be formed and the computation of K-means are expensive. K-means algorithm is a two-step process includes initialization and assignment step. This paper works on initialization step of the algorithm and proposed an efficient enhanced K-means clustering algorithm which eliminates the deficiency of the existing one. A new initialization approach has been introduced in the paper to drawn an initial cluster centers for K means Algorithm.

Clustering a data was always an easy task but achieving the required accuracy, precision and performance was never so easy. K means being an archaic clustering algorithm got tested and experimented thousands of times with variety of datasets and other combination of algorithm due to its robustness and simplicity but what this algorithm proposed was not suggested before. It used K means algorithm for the evaluation and validation purposes whereas optimization of the data is done with the help of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm. The drawbacks of K means mainly its local convergence property and initializing number of clusters at an early stage has aroused the process of working on this algorithm. So, for attaining the global convergence the Swarm Intelligence is preferred over Genetic Algorithm and many other techniques and for the latter one we combined two functions one of them helps in knowing the number of clusters which are optimal for the particular dataset and the other one validates the results using another function and compares the various metrics which will define the goodness and fitness of an algorithm. In one line the complete overview of the proposed algorithm can be described as 'Evaluating the data using an Evalcluster Function, performing Validation with the help of an Evaluate Function of the K means and giving the final touch of Optimizing the data by K means PSO Algorithm'.

One of the important problems is how to use records with unknown values from training as well as testing data. Many approaches have been proposed to address the impact of unknown values at training on accuracy of prediction. However, very few techniques are there to address the problem in testing data. In our earlier work, we discussed and summarized these strategies in details. In Lazy Decision Tree, the problem of unknown attribute values in test instance is completely eliminated by delaying the construction of tree till the classification time and using only known attributes for classification. In this paper we present novel algorithm 'Eager Decision Tree' which constructs a single prediction model at the time of training which considers all possibilities of unknown attribute values from testing data. It naturally removes the problem of handing unknown values in testing data in Decision Tree induction like Lazy Decision Tree. © 2017 IEEE.",data mining; decision tree; eager decision tree; lazy decision tree; missing values; testing data; UAT branch.

In this big data era, the unpredictable flow and huge quantity of data brings new challenges in FPM such as space and time complexity. In general, most of the research work focus on recognizing the patterns that occurs frequently, from the set of specific data, where the patterns within every transaction were definitely known a priori. Among these, the users focus only on the small part of this FP. In order to tackle such problems in the current scenario, it is necessary sometimes to select the important features alone, using appropriate FPM algorithms, in order to reduce the complexity level. The major objective of this work is to improve FPM mining results and improve classification accuracy of big dataset samples. To tackle the first challenge, the levy flight bat algorithm (LFBA) along with online feature selection (OFS) approach is proposed, which is used to filter the low quality features from the big data in an online manner. Subsequently to address the second challenge, a weighted entropy frequent pattern mining (WEFPM) is enforced for FPM, to accomplish better computation time when compared with other methods such as direct discriminative pattern mining (DDPMine) and iterative sampling based frequent itemset mining (ISbFIM), where enumeration of entire feature combinations were completed. So the WEFPM algorithm employed in this paper, targets to identify only the specific frequent patterns which are required by the user. By iterating this procedure, it assures that the acquired frequent patterns can be enumerated by using both the theoretical and empirical research, so that enumeration doesn’t proceed into a combinatorial explosion. And also, using the above said LFBA–OFS approach and WEFPM algorithm, frequent patterns that are different in nature, are generated for building high quality learning model. For finding the frequent patterns, here the minimum support threshold is matched with entropy. As a final step, multiple Kernel learning support vector machine is employed as a classifier, to evaluate the performance of the big data samples for efficiency and accuracy. Empirical study reveal that considerable progress is obtained in terms of accuracy and computation time when applied to UCI benchmark big datasets, using the proposed approach for efficient and effective FPM of the online features. It is clear that WEFPM is the most efficient method, because it produces higher average accuracy results of 92.34, 93.218, 91.374 and 87.87% values for adult, chess, hybo and sick dataset respectively.

A recommendation system would help to tackle such a problem. However, due to the lack of sufficient amount of data, most of the state-of-the-art methods perform poorly in terms of recommending relevant news items to the users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for Item-based Collaborative filtering for recommending news items using Markov Decision Process (MDP). Due to the sequential nature of news reading, we choose MDP to model our recommendation system as it is based on a sequence optimization paradigm. Further, we also incorporate factors like article freshness and similarity into our system by extrinsically modelling it in terms of reward for the MDP. We compare it with various other state-of-the-art methods. On a moderately low amount of data we see that our MDP-based approach outperforms the other approaches. One of the reasons for this is that the baselines fail to identify the underlying patterns within the sequence in which the articles are read by the users. Hence, the baselines are not able to generalize well. © 2017 IEEE.",Collaborative Filtering; Markov Decision Process; News Recommendation; Semantic Similarity,Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Markov processes; Semantics; Item-based collaborative filtering; Markov Decision Processes; News aggregators; News recommendation; Semantic similarity; Sequence optimization; State-of-the-art methods; User data; Recommender systems,"Kumar, V.; Information Retrieval and Extraction Laboratory, International Institute of Information Technology HyderabadIndia; email: vaibhav.kumar@research.iiit.ac.in",Gottumukkala R.Karypis G.Raghavan V.Wu X.Miele L.Aluru S.Ning X.Dong G.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

However, the exploration of deep neural networks for content based recommendation has received a relatively less amount of inspection. Also, different recommendation scenarios have their own issues which creates the need for different approaches for recommendation. One of the problems with news recommendation is that of handling temporal changes in user interests. Hence, modelling temporal behaviour in the domain of news recommendation becomes very important. In this work, we propose a recommendation model which uses semantic similarity between words as input to a 3-D Convolutional Neural Network in order to extract the temporal news reading pattern of the users.

Typically, modeling temporal behavior increases the cost of parameter inference and estimation. Along with it, it also poses the constraint of requiring a large amount of data for reliably learning the parameters of the model. Therefore, it is often difficult to model temporal behavior in large-scale real-world recommendation systems. In this work, we propose a deep neural network architecture which is based on a two level approach. We first generate document embeddings for every news article. We then use these embeddings and the previously read articles by a user to come up with her user profile. We then use this profile along with adequate positive and negative samples in order to train our model. The resulting model is then applied to a real-world data set.

In order to explore these relationships, there is a need to integrate dimensionality reduction techniques with data mining approaches and graph theory. The correlations in data points emerge more clearly if this integration is flawless. We propose an approach called Local Graph Based Correlation Clustering (LGBACC). This approach merges hierarchical clustering, with PCA to uncover complex hierarchical relationships, and uses graph models to visualize the results. We propose a framework of this approach that is divided into four phases. Each phase is flawlessly integrated with the next phase. Visualization of data after each phase is an important output and is knitted into the fabric of the framework. The focus of this technique remains on obtaining high quality clusters. The quality of the final clusters obtained is measured using standard indices. It is found that LGBACC is better than the existing hierarchical clustering approaches. We have used real-world data sets to validate our framework. These datasets test the approach on low as well as high-dimensional data. It is found that LGBACC produces high-quality clusters across a wide spectrum of dimensionality. Scalability test on synthetically produced high-dimensional and large datasets show that the proposed approach runs efficiently. Hence, LGBACC is an efficient and scalable approach that produces high-quality clusters in high-dimensional and large data spaces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cluster quality; Correlation clustering; Dimensionality reduction; Graph analysis; Hierarchical clustering,Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Data visualization; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Cluster qualities; Correlation clustering; Dimensionality reduction; Graph analysis; Hier-archical clustering; Reduction,"Pandove, D.; Research Lab, Computer Science and Engineering Department, Thapar University, Patiala, Punjab, India; email: dpandove@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,9507051,,KNSYE,,English,Knowl Based Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031698278

Frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark have gained a lot of traction over the past decades and have become massively popular, especially in industries. It is becoming increasingly evident that effective big data analysis is key to solving artificial intelligence problems. Thus, a multi-algorithm library was implemented in the Spark framework, called MLlib. While this library supports multiple machine learning algorithms, there is still scope to use the Spark setup efficiently for highly time-intensive and computationally expensive procedures like deep learning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the distributive computational abilities of Apache Spark and the advanced machine learning architecture of a deep multi-layer perceptron (MLP), using the popular concept of Cascade Learning. We conduct empirical analysis of our framework on two real world datasets. The results are encouraging and corroborate our proposed framework, in turn proving that it is an improvement over traditional big data analysis methods that use either Spark or Deep learning as individual elements. © 2017 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Data handling; Data mining; Deep learning; Information analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Algorithm libraries; Apache hadoop; Computational ability; Empirical analysis; Library support; Multi layer perceptron; Multiple machine; Real-world datasets; Big data,,Gottumukkala R.Karypis G.Raghavan V.Wu X.Miele L.Aluru S.Ning X.Dong G.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

It is possible to mine the repertoire of biochemical transformations from reaction databases, and apply the knowledge to predict reactions to synthesize new molecules. However, this usually involves a careful understanding of the mechanism and the knowledge of the exact bonds being created and broken. There is a need for a method to rapidly predict reactions for synthesizing new molecules, which relies only on the structures of the molecules, without demanding additional information such as thermodynamics or hand-curated reactant mapping, which are often hard to obtain accurately. Results: We here describe a robust method based on subgraph mining, to predict a series of biochemical transformations, which can convert between two (even previously unseen) molecules. We first describe a reliable method based on subgraph edit distance to map reactants and products, using only their chemical structures. Having mapped reactants and products, we identify the reaction centre and its neighbourhood, the reaction signature, and store this in a reaction rule network. This novel representation enables us to rapidly predict pathways, even between previously unseen molecules. We demonstrate this ability by predicting pathways to molecules not present in the KEGG database. We also propose a heuristic that predominantly recovers natural biosynthetic pathways from amongst hundreds of possible alternatives, through a directed search of the reaction rule network, enabling us to provide a reliable ranking of the different pathways. Our approach scales well, even to databases with >100 000 reactions. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

This paper investigates various issues related to a political chatterbot where human agents are politically opinionated. Here, understanding the latent intent of human agent is crucial for developing an efficient political chatterbot. We set our study in the context of 2016 Brexit referendum. We argue that employing a subjectivity detector and an emotion analyzer, in addition to the keyword based topic detector, enhances the intent detection process. Next, we discuss the importance of maintaining political neutrality. To maintain its neutrality, a chatterbot needs to disassociate itself from a politically opinionated response. This can be achieved by associating a response with a user or a set of users. Nowadays, the Twitter platform provides an enormous amount of user-generated contents for various socio-economic events. Hence, we have considered tweet feeds for developing the overall chatterbot architecture in the political domain. © 2017 IEEE.",2016 Brexit Referendum; Chatterbot; Twitter,Data mining; Economics; Supervised learning; 2016 Brexit Referendum; Chatterbots; Conversational agents; Intent detection; Semi-supervised learning methods; Socio-economics; Twitter; User-generated content; Social networking (online),,Gottumukkala R.Karypis G.Raghavan V.Wu X.Miele L.Aluru S.Ning X.Dong G.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

One of the important aspects of this analysis, dealing with huge number of fragments, is partitioning them based on their level of similarities. In this paper we propose a space transformation based clustering approach to achieve this partitioning. In this approach, we transform each sequence by a set of reference sequences into a point in a multidimensional vector space and do the clustering in this vector space. We show through extensive analysis that the proposed transformation very closely preserve the clustering properties of the sequences using edit distance. Time for this transformation is linear with the number of sequences. The amount of time saving for this clustering is significant because in this approach edit distance calculations between two sequences are replaced by vector distance calculations between two corresponding feature vectors. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering using single and average linkage because they are frequently used by the bioinformatics community. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering runs in quadratic time with the number of sequences and clustering time for this approach in the edit space can be prohibitive for large number of sequences. There exists greedy heuristic methods that perform clustering much faster but at the cost of significantly reduced cluster quality. We have applied our method to 16S rRNA fragment datasets obtained from different environmental samples. In these experiments, RESTRAC achieves up to five hundred times speed-up for single linkage and up to five times speed-up for average linkage while preserving good cluster quality. © 2017 IEEE.",OTU clustering; Space Transformation,Data mining; Gene encoding; Heuristic methods; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Nucleic acids; RNA; Vectors; Agglomerative hierarchical clustering; Cluster qualities; Clustering properties; Environmental sample; Multi-dimensional vectors; Next-generation sequencing; OTU clustering; Space transformations; Vector spaces,,Gottumukkala R.Karypis G.Raghavan V.Wu X.Miele L.Aluru S.Ning X.Dong G.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

An estimate of skill adjacency or fungibility or substitutability is critical for effective capacity planning, analytics and optimization in the face of changing skill requirements of an organization. The proposed approach is based on computing a similarity measure between skills, using each available data source, and combining these similarities into a measure of fungibility. We present both supervised and unsupervised integration methods and demonstrate that these produce improved outcomes, compared to using any single skill similarity source alone, using data from a large IT organization. The skills' fungibility matrix created using this approach has been deployed by the organization for clustering skills for use in demand forecasting. A possible extension of this work is to use the fungibility measure to cluster skills and develop a skill-centric representation of an organization to enable strategic assessments and planning. © 2017 IEEE.",Data integration; Demand forecasting; Fungibility; Skill-capacity analytics; Skill-similarity,Data mining; Forecasting; Demand forecasting; Fungibility; Information sources; Integration method; Multiple data sources; Skill-capacity analytics; Skill-similarity; Strategic assessment; Data integration,,Gottumukkala R.Karypis G.Raghavan V.Wu X.Miele L.Aluru S.Ning X.Dong G.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This requires the bending and cutting of the rebar to proper size before they can be used for construction. A novel haptic based barbending simulator has been devised which enables the trainees to learn and improve the construction rebar bending skill in a safe and controlled way. With its limited assessment and reporting features, the computerised virtual training simulator proves to be effective in training. Adding the features like personalized skill tracking and predictive performance modeling holds even more potential in supporting the training program. Towards this goal, a user performance modeling needs to be done which includes an initial study on performance parameters, assessment criteria and data collection before remodeling the simulator. This paper presents a study on the performance parameters for the bar bending simulator and also evaluates its effectiveness in modeling expert and novice performances. During this study we also hypothesize the parameters that can distinguish an expert and novice performances which was validated with 2 classification techniques - Support vector machine and J48 Decision tree. While revealing the classification rules J48 algorithm provides 78.94% accuracy where as SVM provides 94.737% accuracy. The study also shows that the 2 performance parameters force applied over time and bend angle accuracy are effective to distinguish expert and novice level of expertize for the construction rebar bending skill. © 2017 IEEE.",Decision trees; Intelligent systems; Machine learning algorithms; Modeling; Support vector machines; Vocational training,Concretes; Data mining; Decision trees; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Models; Reinforced concrete; Reinforcement; Simulators; Support vector machines; Assessment criteria; Classification rules; Classification technique; Identification and evaluation; Performance parameters; Predictive performance models; Virtual training simulators; Vocational training; Personnel training,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The proposed work extracts crime reports from online newspapers providing crime information against women in Indian states and in its union territories. Each of the crime reports are encoded as bag-of-words and an exhaustive list of words have been prepared. Then the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm is used as a multi-objective optimization technique that provides a non dominated pareto front leading to selection of optimal features related to crime. The selected features also helps in further crime pattern analysis. This algorithm has two objective functions based on external clusters validation index and number of features in a sample. Significant research works related to optimization techniques exist in the past, but none have done global optimization on crime datasets.

Customer preferences, options and experiences can be analyzed through social media, reviews, blogs and other online social networking site data. However, due to increasing informal usage of local languages in social media platforms, multi-lingual or code-mixed data is fast becoming a common occurrence. Mixed code is generated when users use more than a single language in social network comments. Such data presents a significant challenge for applications using sentiment analysis and is yet to be fully explored by researchers. Existing sentiment analysis methods applied to monolingual social data are not suitable for code-mixed data due to the inconsistency in the grammatical structure in these sentences. In this paper, a novel method focused on performing effective sentiment analysis of bilingual sentences written in Hindi and English is proposed, that takes into account linguistic code switching and the grammatical transitions between the two considered languages. Experimental evaluation using real-world, code-mixed datasets obtained from Facebook showed that the proposed approach achieved very good accuracy and was also efficient performance-wise. © 2017 IEEE.",Code-mixed data; grammatical transitions; lexical analysis; Machine Learning; Sentiment analysis,Codes (symbols); Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Network coding; Domain-specific sentiment analysis; Experimental evaluation; Grammatical structure; Lexical analysis; Mixed data; Online social networkings; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Social networking (online),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

But it is difficult to manually access the crime reports to derive useful information that can provide insights to the law enforcement officers for analysing the crime trends. The present work emphasizes on a simple yet efficient two stage approach for analysing crime against women in India. Initially, the proposed framework extracts crime reports from online newspaper articles. Once the data is collected, the first stage approach provides an interesting aspect by identifying named entities like name of states, cities, person etc. from the dataset and a collection of top ten entities of various categories is ranked according to their frequency of occurrence. The preliminary assessment shows feasible results which are also compared with crime records drawn from National Crime Records Bureau. However, the identified subtypes of entities are mostly ignored whereas dealing only with the basic entities fails to provide in-depth recognition of crime trends. So considering the subtypes can really provide the prerequisites for finer distinction in the field of crime data mining. The second stage approach in the present work considers the sub-types of named entities as 'Modus Operandi' features (mode of operation) of the crime that caters exquisite perception of the crime performed against women in India. Though lot of research exists on crime analysis, considering modus operandi features is very less. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the method with high recall and precision for the identified named entities. © 2017 IEEE.",Crime reports; modus operandi; named entity recognition; precision; recall; text mining,Character recognition; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Modus operandi; Named entity recognition; precision; recall; Text mining; Crime,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The important feature of vertical data layout is that it count the frequency fast using intersection operations on transaction ids (tids). It prunes automatically irrelevant data. The algorithm uses Linked list data structure due to which it takes less execution time to generate frequent patterns. It runs with efficient memory usage. It scans the dataset only two times.

One of the main challenges for designing an object tracking technique is energy conservation. Prediction based strategies are used to save energy. We consider an application where a WSN is installed in a forest for tracking the movement of animals (objects). Since, animals move in certain paths rather moving entirely randomly, we attempt to use this property. The movement patterns of the objects are extracted using a data mining technique. This information is used to predict the object movement with the aim to reduce the energy consumption in tracking. In situations where the prediction is erroneous, we propose a systematic recovery mechanism. The recovery mechanism has three levels. The number of additional nodes woken up progressively increases with the increase in the recovery level. If an object has been detected at a lower level, normal operations are resumed. It is observed that there are significant energy savings due to this systematic recovery mechanism. The proposed technique, called DESPOT, is fully distributed and energy efficient. We have carried out extensive simulation of DESPOT and have compared its performance with an existing technique, called PTSP. Simulation results show that DESPOT conserves significant energy and it has a better tracking efficiency than PTSP. © 2017 IEEE.",data mining; distributed; prediciton; tracking; wireless sensor networks,Animals; Computer system recovery; Data mining; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Object detection; Recovery; Surface discharges; Tracking (position); distributed; Energy efficient; Extensive simulations; Normal operations; Prediciton; Prediction-based; Recovery mechanisms; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, Aspect based Sentiment Summarization (ASFuL) is proposed with fuzzy logic by classifying opinions polarity as strong positive, positive, negative and strong negative.

Traditional frequent itemset mining (FIM) generate large amount of frequent itemset without considering the quantity and profit of item purchased. High utility itemset mining (HUIM) gives advantageous results as compared to the frequent itemset mining. HUIM algorithm helps to improve the performance of finding data by considering both quantity and profit of itemset from large database. This paper reviews two types of efficient algorithm named TKU (mining top-k utility itemset) and TKO (mining top-k utility itemsets in One phase) for mining high utility itemset without any need to set minimum utility threshold by using strategy of UP-tree data structure which scans the database twice and enhances the efficiency of mining High utility itemset. It find out transaction utility of each transaction and it also compute TWU of each item. Then it reorganizes the transaction and constructs the Up Tree. © 2017 IEEE.,Data mining; Frequent itemset; High utility itemset; Utility pattern tree,Database systems; Profitability; Trees (mathematics); Frequent itemset; Frequent itemset mining; Hidden patterns; High utility itemset; High utility itemset minings; Interesting information; Pattern trees; Tree data structures; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Immense amount of data is being put out onto the public domain through social media. This huge publicly available data can be used for research and a variety of applications. The objective of this paper is to counter problems with the social media dataset, namely : short text nature - the limited quantity of text data (140 to 160 characters), continuous streaming nature, usage of short forms and modern slangs and increasing use of sarcasm in messages and posts. Sarcastic tweets can mislead data mining activities and result in wrong classification. This paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Adaptive Boost, Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naïve Bayes to detect sarcasm in tweets from the Twitter Streaming API. The best classifier is chosen and paired with various pre-processing and filtering techniques using emoji and slang dictionary mapping to provide the best possible accuracy.

We find that the best way to handle these challenges is to construct axioms corresponding to alternative formalizations of the sentence so that the end-user can make an appropriate choice. The output is compared against human-authored axioms and in substantial number of cases, human-authored axiom is indeed one of the alternatives given by the system.

Among different variants of rough clustering, rough-probabilistic clustering is a new concept introduced recently. In rough-probabilistic clustering, a class is defined as the union of two disjoint regions, namely, a crisp lower approximation region and a probabilistic boundary region. In this regard, stomped normal (SN) distribution provides a statistical modeling of the data set in rough-probabilistic clustering framework. The SN distribution models the central tendency, dispersion, and width of the lower approximation region of each class using its mean, variance, and width parameter, respectively. However, it does not take into consideration the property of kurtosis of the class distribution, which controls the concentration of values around mean and shape of the tail of data distribution. In this background, a novel probability distribution, named stomped-t (St) distribution, is introduced in the paper for rough-probabilistic clustering. The proposed probability distribution incorporates the property of kurtosis into the SN framework.

The emerging area called privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) focus on individual privacy without compromising data mining results. An adversarial exploitation of published data poses a risk of information disclosure about individuals. On the other hand, imposing privacy constraints on the data results in substantial information loss and compromises the legitimate data analysis. Motivated by the increasing growth of PPDM algorithms, we first investigate the privacy implications and the crosscutting issues between privacy versus utility of data. We present a privacy model that embeds the anonymization procedure in to a learning algorithm and this has mitigated the additional overheads imposed on data mining tasks. Our primary concern about PPDM is that the utility of data should not be compromised by the transformation applied. Different data mining classification workloads are analyzed with the proposed anonymization procedure for any side effects incurred. It is shown empirically that classification accuracy obtained for most of the datasets outperforms the results obtained with original dataset. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Anonymization; Classification; Data mining; Decomposition; Evolutionary partitioning; Privacy,Classification (of information); Data mining; Decomposition; Evolutionary algorithms; Metadata; Population statistics; Publishing; Anonymization; Classification accuracy; Evolutionary partitioning; Individual privacy; Information disclosure; Mining classification; Privacy constraints; Privacy preserving data mining; Data privacy,"Ilavarasi, A.K.; Sona College of TechnologyIndia; email: ilavarasi.shakthi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028594889

It aims to find sets of items i.e. itemsets from a database with utility no less than a user defined threshold. The notion of utility provides more flexibility to an analyst to mine relevant itemsets. Nowadays, a continuous and unbounded stream of data is generated from web-clicks, transaction flow from retail stores, sensor networks, etc. Mining high-utility itemsets from a data stream is a challenging task as the incoming stream of data has to be processed on the fly with time and storage memory constraints. The number of high-utility itemsets depends on the user-defined threshold. A large number of itemsets can be generated at very low threshold values and vice versa. It can be a tedious task to set a threshold value to get a reasonable number of itemsets. Top-k high-utility itemset mining was coined to address this issue. k is the number of high-utility itemsets in the result set as defined by the user. In this paper, we propose a data structure and an efficient algorithm for mining top-k high-utility itemsets from a data stream. The algorithm has a single phase that does not generate any candidates, unlike many algorithms that work in two phases, i.e., candidate generation followed by candidates verification. We conduct extensive experiments on several real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs 20 to 80 times better on sparse datasets and 300 to 700 times on dense datasets than the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm requires less memory compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Data mining; Data streams; Pattern mining; Top-k high utility mining; Utility mining,Data communication systems; Data mining; Retail stores; Sensor networks; Candidate generation; Data stream; High utility itemset minings; High utility itemsets; Pattern mining; Sliding window models; State-of-the-art algorithms; Utility mining; Digital storage,"Goyal, V.; Department of Computer Science, Indraprastha Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: vikram@iiitd.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,0924669X,,APITE,,English,Appl Intell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020386407

Advertisements are used in a better way to showcase the company’s product/service and give rise to a worthy online marketing strategy. Posting an advertisement on utilitarian web pages helps to maximize brand reach and get a better feedback. Now-a-days companies are cautious of their brand image on the Internet due to the growing number of Internet users. Since there are billions of Web sites on the Internet, it becomes difficult for companies to really decide where to advertise on the Internet for brand popularity. What if, the company advertise on a page which is visited by less number of the interested (for a particular type of product) users instead of a web page which is visited by more number of the interested users?—this doubt and uncertainty—is a core issue faced by many companies. This research paper presents a Brand analysis framework and suggests some experimental practices to ensure efficiency of the proposed framework. This framework is divided into three components—(1) Web site network formation framework—a framework that forms a Web site network of a specific search query obtained from resultant web pages of three search engines-Google, Yahoo & Bing and their associated web pages; (2) content scraping framework—it crawls the content of web pages existing in the framework-formed Web site network; (3) rank assignment of networked web pages—text edge processing algorithm has been used to find out terms of interest and their occurrence associated with search query. We have further applied sentiment analysis to validate positive or negative impact of the sentences, having the search term and its associated terms (with reference to the search query) to identify impact of web page. Later, on the basis of both—text edge analysis and sentiment analysis results, we assigned a rank to networked web pages and online social network pages. In this research work, we present experiments for ‘Motorola smart phone,’ ‘LG smart phone’ and ‘Samsung smart phone’ as search query and sampled the Web site network of top 20 search results of all three search engines and examined up to 60 search results for each search engine. This work is useful to target the right online location for specific brand marketing. Once the brand knows the web pages/social media pages containing high brand affinity and ensures that the content of high affinity web page/social media page has a positive impact, we advertise at that respective online location. Thus, targeted brand analysis framework for online marketing not only has benefits for the advertisement agencies but also for the customers. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Advertisement; Brand popularity; Sentiment analysis; Social network; Text edge processing; Webpage network; Webpage ranking,Data mining; Electronic commerce; Marketing; Search engines; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Websites; Advertisement; Analysis frameworks; Brand popularity; Network formation; On-line social networks; Processing algorithms; Search Engines - Google; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online),"Arora, A.; CSE/IT Department, Jaypee Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: anuja.arora29@gmail.com",,Springer-Verlag Wien,18695450,,,,English,Soc.

With the information explosion of different learning algorithms and the changing data scenarios, there is a need of smart learning system. The paper shows one approach where past experiences learned are used to suggest the best suitable learner using 3 meta-features namely simple, statistical and information theoretic features. The system tests 38 UCI benchmark datasets from various domains using nine classifiers from various categories. It is observed that for 29 datasets, i.e., 76 % of datasets, both the predicted and actual accuracies directly match. The proposed approach is found to be correct for algorithm selection of these datasets. New proposed equation of finding classifier accuracy based on meta-features is determined and validated.

To better understand the behavior of users on social network, we need to mine the interactions of users and their demographic data. Companies with less or no expertise in mining would need to share this data with the companies of expertise for mining purposes. The major challenge in sharing the social network data is maintaining the individual privacy on social network while retaining the implicit knowledge embedded in the social network. Thus, there is a need of anonymizing the social network data before sharing it to the third-party. The current study proposes to use upper approximation concept of rough sets for developing a solution for privacy preserving social network graph publishing. The proposed algorithm is capable of preserving the privacy of graph structure while simultaneously maintaining the utility or value that can be generated from the graph structure. The proposed algorithm is validated by showing its effectiveness on several graph mining tasks like clustering, classification, and PageRank computation.

Moreover, the determination of minimum support and confidence is very hard in a dataset containing multiple-level taxonomy. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, coherent rule mining was proposed. The proposed approach first mines multiple-level coherent rules in a predefined taxonomy and then extracts specialized coherent rules. The rules are mentioned as specialized rules because they exist only in the bottommost level of taxonomy irrespective of their predecessor rules.

But it faces the challenge of weights assignment to features to measure similarity between cases. There are many methods to overcome this feature weighting problem of CBR. However, neural network’s pruning is one of the powerful and useful methods to overcome this feature weighting problem, which extracts feature weights from trained neural network without losing the generality of training set by four popular mechanisms: sensitivity, activity, saliency and relevance. It is habitually assumed that the training sets used for learning are balanced. However, this hypothesis is not always true in real-world applications, and hence, the tendency is to yield classification models that are biased toward the overrepresented class. Therefore, a hybrid CBR system is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem, which adopts a cost-sensitive back-propagation neural network (BPNN) in network pruning to find feature weights. These weights are used in CBR. A single cost parameter is used by the cost-sensitive BPNN to distinguish the importance of class errors. A balanced decision boundary is generated by the cost parameter using prior information. Thus, the class imbalance problem of network pruning is overcome to improve the accuracy of the hybrid CBR. From the empirical results, it is observed that the performance of the proposed hybrid CBR system is better than the hybrid CBR by standard neural network. The performance of the proposed hybrid system is validated with seven datasets. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial neural networks; Case-based reasoning; Data mining; k-NN similarity measure; Similarity measure,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Case based reasoning; Costs; Data mining; Hybrid systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Artificial intelligent; Back-propagation neural networks; Case based reasoning systems; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Class imbalance problems; Cost-sensitive neural networks; Similarity measure; Trained neural networks; Problem solving,"Biswas, S.K.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, NIT SilcharIndia; email: bissarojkum@yahoo.com",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982297886

Web contains billions of web pages. The web access behaviour of one web user differs from that of another and also it changes with respect to their temporal property. By analyzing the users’ data, the web administrator can personalize the web pages according to individual web users’ interest. Personalizing the web page gives various advantages in this fast era such as low search time, less data transfer, higher availability of data, lower bandwidth traffic, targeted advertisement and identifying the threaded web users and high web users satisfaction. Due to the above advantages, it is very much essential in the present World Wide Web. Various algorithms, techniques and tools are available in the field of web usage mining. Although there are various techniques, algorithms and tools developed related to web usage mining, new techniques are required to make the discovery of knowledge more accurate. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed by using various methods such as web log, web ranking, web rating and web review based method to identify the success rate of various web pages and summarize the value to identify the accurate success rate of each web page. The success rate is normalized and aggregated into three categories for personalizing the web user. Personalizing the web user based on grouping relevant web access behaviour reduces the calculation complexity. It is very effective in very large websites.

As document vectors contain terms and their importances in documents, discovering association and disassociation between terms is very important. This paper introduces characterization of evolving behavior of document vectors to identify similar and dissimilar segments in document vectors. This approach is particularly suitable where document vectors contain similar patterns of term occurrences but the patterns could be away from each other with regard to distance. The main objective of this paper is to capture evolving structure of context vector, document vector of contextually related terms, for discovering similarity between them. Context vector reduces the size of document vector from 6 to 12.57%. Evaluation is done by clustering the documents using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean with standard datasets. This results in formation of clusters with better entropy and purity.

The issues are then directed to appropriate experts for analysis and fixing. However, submitters often misclassify an improvement request as a bug and vice versa. This costs valuable developer time. Hence automated classification of the submitted reports would be of great practical utility. In this paper, we analyze how machine learning techniques may be used to perform this task. We apply different classification algorithms, namely naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine (SVM) with various kernels, decision tree and random forest separately to classify the reports from three open-source projects.

To migrate an application written using 1 API (source) to another API (target), a developer must know how the methods in the source API map to the methods in the target API. Given that a typical platform or language exposes a large number of API methods, manually discovering API mappings is prohibitively resource-intensive and may be error prone. The goal of this research is to support software developers in migrating an application from a source API to a target API by automatically discovering relevant method mappings across APIs using text mining on the natural language API method descriptions. This paper proposes text mining based approach (TMAP) to discover relevant API mappings. To evaluate our approach, we used TMAP to discover API mappings for 15 classes across (1) Java and C# API; and (2) Java ME and Android API. We compared the discovered mappings with state-of-the-art source code analysis-based approaches: Rosetta and StaMiner. Our results indicate that TMAP on average found relevant mappings for 56% and 57% more methods compared to the Rosetta and the StaMiner approaches, respectively.

The applications of classification problems has increased so rapidly that the need for efficient and accurate classifiers has become a vital requirement in the area of data mining. Multi-label classification problem is distinguished from the single label classification because of the capability to handle multiple labels. In this paper, we put forward a good method to predict the multiple labels of an unlabeled instance by using apriori algorithm. The proposed solution MLCA is able to find unknown labels for any test instance by checking for the presence of particular set of attributes, along with their discretized values. MLC-A intends to employ Apriori algorithm for multi-label classification purpose, in contrast, to the well known existing methods. Apriori algorithm is utilized to find the relationship between attributes and labels by generating rules. The generated rules will find the occurrence of a label given the existence of various attributes. The experimental results on datasets of yeast, scene and emotions had given excellent accuracy. Using MLC-A the time complexity has reduced to a great extend.

Enhancing student assessment methods for employability can improve their understanding about companies in order to get suitable company for them. So, enhanced employability prediction of student can help them to match their desirability with company requirements and fill the gap between the two in order to fit the job profile of company for which they are looking for. Data mining with intelligent learning algorithms is used to enrich the current assessment process. The data for training classifier model is collected from survey by making students appear for assessment test to measure their skills. This data can be valuable to find their proficiency in various skill sets such as soft skills, problem-solving skills, technical skills etc. as well as their weaknesses that they need to overcome for being employable in various companies.

The algorithm employed there, modeled the intrusion signal as a linear combination of chirplets. The extracted chirplet-based features were fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification. This resulted in a platform that, under the tested conditions, resulted in high classification accuracy, in excess of 95%. The current paper is aimed at determining the extent to which the classification accuracy could be attributed to the use of the algorithm employed. Fifteen different algorithms for intrusion detection and classification are examined in the current paper, these operate on a database that builds on top of the earlier database. These fifteen algorithms correspond to the different possible pairings obtained by selecting from among 5 feature-vectors and 3 classifiers. The results show that the chirplet-based feature extractor to play a major role in achieving high-accuracy classification, easily beating the performance of the other feature extractors, particularly in terms of the more challenging task of separating intrusion from vegetative clutter. The two principal conclusions that can perhaps be drawn here are that (a) chirplet-decomposition can be a very effective feature-extractor in the case of a PIR signal and (b) it is important to incorporate domain knowledge where possible in designing the most effective classification algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Passive infrared sensor; Pattern classification; Pyroelectric infrared sensor; Wildlife protection; Wireless sensor network,Animals; Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Feature extractor; Linear combinations; Outdoor environment; Passive infrared sensors; Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensor; Wildlife protection; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The first technique is based on partial decompression and limited usage of OCR, and the second technique is completely decompression-less and OCR-less. Both the word spotting techniques use word bounding box ratio feature initially for matching words in the database of compressed document images. For all the matching test-words, the word spotting strategy in the first model is to decompress and OCR first two characters, and then match with the keyword characters. If the matching is successful, then the remaining characters of the test-word are decompressed and OCRed, and eventually matched with the keyword. The word spotting strategy applied in the second model is to extract run based features like number of run transitions and the corresponding correlation of runs along the selected regions of the matching test word, and then match with that of the specified keyword. The proposed methods work in Run-Length Compressed Domain (RLCD) with the capability of operating on CCITT Group 3 1D, CCITT Group 3 2D, and CCITT Group 4 2D compressed documents supported by TIFF and PDF file formats.

This knowledge can be used for prefetching of web pages, finding web pages that are frequently accessed together, etc. This paper presents a modification in the original CA clustering algorithm for grouping of web users with respect to access pattern of web pages. The original CA algorithm uses the basic ""Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm"" to compute the membership matrix. The modified CA algorithm uses a superior FCM algorithm, namely, the Density Weighted FCM (DWFCM) instead of the basic FCM. Experiments are conducted on the datasets obtained from the UCI repository.

Since software maintainability prediction is a complicated process; estimating maintainability in the prior phases of software development lifecycle (SDLC) is advantageous. Further, it helps in building economical software and improving resource planning well in advance. Software metrics are strongly correlated with software maintainability as they help in examining the structural quality and characteristics of a software. Feature subset selection (FSS) is an important data preprocessing technique used in data mining. It involves determining a subset of notable features for building a prediction model. All software metrics are not equally relevant; hence, using all of them for predicting maintainability will significantly increase time, budget and effort. Thus, to achieve best maintainability prediction results with a particular learning algorithm, it is critical to select the most relevant features that manifest the characteristics of the software in hand which is this study are two open source software - Apache Jackrabbit and Light Weight Java Game Library (LWJGL). Our main focus has been to reduce the number of metrics using an instancebased FSS technique Relief and then use these relevant metrics to predict maintainability. It was observed that Linear Regression algorithm showed maximum increase of approximately 11% in accuracy levels with Relief FSS algorithm for both the open source software datasets.

This paper seeks to model a large set of Android permissions particularly the permissions from Normal, Dangerous, Signature and Signature Or System categories within a large number of Android application package (APK) files of Cyber Security Data Mining Competition (CDMC 2016), Android malware classification challenge. The sequences of Android permissions are transformed into features by using recurrent LSTM layer with bag-of-words embedding and the extracted features are fed into dense and activation layer with non-linear activation function such as sigmoid for classification. Furthermore, to selectively find out the optimal paramaters and network structure, we have done various experimens with different network parameters and network structures. All experiments are run up to 1000 epochs with a learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5]. All LSTM network configurations have substantially performed well in classification settings of 5-fold cross validation in comparison to the recurrent neural network (RNN). Most importantly, LSTM has achieved the highest accuracy as 0.897 on the real-world Android malware test data set, provided by CDMC2016. This is primarily due to fact that the LSTM houses a complex memory processing unit that facilitates to learn the temporal behaviors quickly with sparse representations of Android permissions sequences. Thus, we claim that applying LSTM network to permission based Android malware classification is more appropriate. © 2017 IEEE.",Android; APK (application package); Deep learning; Long short-Term memory (LSTM); Malware detection and classification; Permissions; Recurrent neural network (RNN),Brain; Chemical activation; Computer crime; Data mining; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Malware; Recurrent neural networks; Statistical tests; Android; APK (application package); Malware detection; Permissions; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Android (operating system),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To find out the frequent itemsets is an essential and vital issue in numerous information mining applications. There are many algorithms present to extract frequent itemsets like Apriori and FP-Growth. But these algorithms lack properties like parallelization, load balancing, data distribution, and fault tolerance on large clusters or big data. A Modified Apriori method is introduced here in which, the mappers and reducers will work simultaneously. This method uses three MapReduce to calculate frequent itemset.

The documents are of varied and flexible web, there are tough relationships with a web docs and a connection with others.

This article presents a diffused language area of topology with a diffuse cluster algorithm to discover the contextual concept of Web docs. The chief objective and mission of this research is to focus on the clustering algorithm and to discover latent semantics within a diffused linguistic text body. In addition, the scope of applications can be stretched to accompany areas such as data mining, bioinformatics, content control or information gathering, and so on. Secondly, when it is observed that recovery docs usually belongs to one of the research topic that can be distinctly different as compared to other issues, the major difference between is usually with other issues. Web content can be grouped into hierarchy issues based on diffused language measures. Web data and files that constitutes in the definition of docs are complicated and complex in nature. There are complex links within single Web docs, and there may be complex relationships with other docs.

In data processing and data mining, duplicates can effect severely. Data deduplication is a technique that eliminates duplicate data and store only one copy, promoting single instance storage. The main challenges are to identify maximum duplicate segment and selecting the storage nodes for distributing fragments of files. In this paper we proposed, Duplicate Detection and Fragment Placement (DDFP) a deduplication system that effectively eliminates duplicate data and fragments placement that allocates unique instances of a data file on storage nodes. For repeated data, reference pointer is used and only unique data is stored on the storage node. This increases the percentage of duplicate data detection. A fragment placement algorithm is used for placing fragments on different storage nodes.

Aviation safety inspectors apply a broad knowledge about aviation industry, aviation safety, and the central laws and regulations, and strategies affecting aviation. In addition, they put on severe technical knowledge and skill in the operation and maintenance of aircraft. Data mining methods also have been successfully applied in aviation safety management system. Aviation industry accumulates large amount of knowledge and data. This paper proposes a method that applied data mining technique on the accident reports of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) accident/incident data system database which contains accident data records for all categories of civil aviation between the years of 1919 and 2014. In this study, we have investigated the application of several data mining methods on the accidents reports, to arrive at new inferences that could help aviation management system. Moreover correlation based feature selection (CFS) with Oscillating Search Technique is used to select the number of prominent attributes that are potential factors causing maximum number of accidents in aircraft. The principle of this work is to find out the effective attributes in order to reduce the number of the accidents in the aviation industry. This proposed novel idea named ""improved oscillated correlation feature selection (IOCFS)"" is evaluated against the conventional classifiers like Naïve bayes, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Multiclass classifier and decision tree (J48). The selected features are tested in terms of their accuracy, running time and reliability as in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate, precision, recall-measure and ROC. The results are seen to be the best for k-NN classifier on comparing with other conventional classifiers, with the value of k = 5. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Aviation; Aviation safety management system; Correlation based feature selection; Improved oscillated correlation feature selection; k-Nearest neighbor; Oscillating search technique,Accident prevention; Aircraft accidents; Aviation; Civil aviation; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Fighter aircraft; Information analysis; Information management; Laws and legislation; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Safety engineering; Support vector machines; Text processing; Aviation safety; Correlation based feature selections (CFS); Correlation features; Data mining applications; Federal Aviation Administration; K-nearest neighbors; Operation and maintenance; Search technique; Data mining,"Koteeswaran, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Veltech Dr. RR & Dr. SR University, Avadi, India; email: skoteeswaranvt@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035101480

It selects a subset of most informative words (terms) from the set of all words. Term distribution affects the feature selection process, e.g. an even distribution of terms in a specific class ensures a higher association of these terms with that class, but an even distribution in almost classes shows a lesser association. This paper computes sample variance using standard Mutual Information (MI) method to measure the variations in distribution of terms. MI method assigns a higher rank to the terms distributed in a specific category (i.e. rare terms) which shows it strong influence with the rare terms than common terms (i.e. terms which most frequently in almost classes). To address this issue, a new text feature selection method named Mutual Information Using Sample Variance (MIUSV) is proposed in this paper. It considers sample variance in term distribution while computing the Mutual Information score of the term. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifiers model, check the utilities of the selected terms by the proposed MIUSV. These models classify four standard text data sets, viz. Webkb, 20Newsgroup, Ohsumed10, and Ohsumed23. Two standard performance measures named Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 show a significant improvement in the results using proposed MIUSV method. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Feature selection; Information Retrieval; Term Frequency; Text Analysis; Text Classification; Text Mining,Classification (of information); Data mining; Information retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN); Multinomial naive bayes; Predictive capabilities; Term Frequency; Text analysis; Text classification; Text feature selections; Text mining; Feature extraction,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

This copious volume of big data is distributed across millions of websites and is available for various applications. Search engines do provide a simple mechanism to access this data. Accessing this data using search engines requires a user to spend time and resources to manually click and download. Clearly, such a manual approach is not scalable for a vast majority of real life applications at the enterprise and organization level. There exist a number of automated approaches to data extraction from the web. Most of these approaches are ad-hoc and domain specific. Therefore, the need for a robust, automated, easy to use framework for extracting content from the web with a minimal human effort across domains appears enticing. The architecture proposed by the authors for a web scraper addresses this gap to harvest data from the web.

It is also defined by the 3V's i.e. Volume, Velocity and Variety. By volume we mean the enormous amount of data that the organizations collect from variety of sources. Velocity here stands for unprecedented speed via which the data streams in and needs to be handled within proper time limits. Lastly, data comes in variety of formats: multi-language, structured, unstructured, email etc. Challenges faced by the organizations with this huge amount of data includes analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying and information privacy. The need of big data doesn't revolve around what amount of data you have, but what you want to do with it. You can fetch the data from any of the source and analyze it to examine and find answers that enable 1) cost reductions, 2) time reductions, 3) new product development and optimized offerings, and 4) smart decision making. Not all the data that is collected is important for the user, so there's a need to refine this data in order to filter out the useful information as filtering the data can make your results more efficient.

In many real-world applications, the presence of an object or a characteristic cannot be given exactly all the time. Instead, they can be better expressed in terms of probability and such data is called uncertain data. Mining frequent patterns from uncertain data is challenging due to presence of existential probabilities. With this scenario, researchers are focusing on mining frequent patterns from uncertain data. Leung et al. proposed a few algorithms like UF-Growth, PUF-Growth for pattern mining from uncertain data. These algorithms mine patterns in a sequential manner. They may not be the efficient solutions when dealing with huge amounts of data. Some other algorithms were proposed which can mine patterns in a parallel and distributed environment. But it has the overhead of data distribution, parallelization etc. All such overheads are internally taken care in MapReduce framework. In MR-Growth algorithm, data is stored in the form of UF-Tree. But when the same item has many different probabilities, the size of UF-Tree becomes large, which may effect the overall efficiency. In this paper, in order to overcome this limitation, we have modified and extended the works of Leung et al. [3] in order to represent the data in compact tree structure for mining uncertain data. The functionality and utility of the proposed MR-PUFGrowth algorithm has been demonstrated and also experimented with different kinds of benchmark datasets like mushroom, connect, retail, T10I4D100K. © 2017 IEEE.",MapReduce; PUF-Tree; Uncertain Data,Data mining; Forestry; Probability; Distributed environments; Existential probability; Frequent pattern mining; Map-reduce; Mapreduce frameworks; Mining uncertain datum; PUF-Tree; Uncertain datas; Trees (mathematics),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, three clustering algorithms such as Medical Storage Platform for data Mining (MSPM), Homogeneity Similarity based Hierarchical (HSH) clustering and K-Harmonic Means-Overlapped K-Means (KHM-OKM) clustering is described and their performance is evaluated. The HSH clustering is an enhancement of hierarchical algorithm that considers the homogeneity and relative population of the clusters to measure the Clustering Performance Index (CPI). The MSPM framework is a modification of Apriori algorithm implemented using MapReduce function. This framework enhances the performance of clustering by the parallel processing of Map and Reduce functions. The KHM-OKM clustering is a hybrid algorithm that combines the K-Harmonic Means and Overlapped K-Means clustering. The results of these algorithms are experimentally evaluated regarding CPI, confidence and FBCubed measure. © 2017 IEEE.",Homogeneity Similarity based Hierarchical (HSH) clustering; K-Harmonic Means-Overlapped K-Means (KHM-OKM)clustering; Medical Storage Platform for data Mining (MSPM),Data mining; Digital storage; Harmonic analysis; Medical computing; Extracting information; Harmonic mean; Hierarchical algorithm; Homogeneity Similarity based Hierarchical (HSH) clustering; Parallel processing; Performance analysis; Performance indices; Storage platforms; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In this paper, we present a novel weighted distance measure based on weighted Euclidean norm which is defined as a function of both vertex and edge attributes, and it can be used for various graph analysis tasks including classification and cluster analysis. The proposed distance measure has flexibility to increase/decrease the weightage of edge labels while calculating the distance between vertex-pairs.We have also proposed a MAGDist algorithm, which reads multi-attributed graph stored in CSV files containing the list of vertex vectors and edge vectors, and calculates the distance between each vertex-pair using the proposed weighted distance measure. Finally, we have proposed a multi-attributed similarity graph generation algorithm, MAGSim, which reads the output of MAGDist algorithm and generates a similarity graph that can be analysed using classification and clustering algorithms. The significance and accuracy of the proposed distance measure and algorithms is evaluated on Iris and Twitter data sets, and it is found that the similarity graph generated by our proposed method yields better clustering results than the existing similarity graph generation methods. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Clustering; Data mining; Multi-attributed graph; Similarity measure; Weighted distance measure,Cluster analysis; Complex networks; Data mining; Directed graphs; Graph theory; Attributed graphs; Classification and clustering; Clustering; Clustering results; Multi-dimensional vectors; Similarity measure; Weighted distance measures; Weighted euclidean; Clustering algorithms,"Jahiruddin; Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia IslamiaIndia; email: jahir.jmi@gmail.com",,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

However, many crowdsourced taxi trip datasets (from Boston, Beijing, Rome, etc.) are publicly available which, despite containing limited information, can be made useful for inferring meaningful insights by certain amount of data engineering. e datasets are both cheap to acquire (hence available in large volumes), and impose less heavy connectivity requirements on the end user. One such crowdsourced dataset is the NYC (New York City) Taxi dataset, which contains only the endpoint information for each trip.

Different from the existing works geared towards cosegmentation or co-localization, in this paper, we explore a new joint processing topic: co-skeletonization, which is defined as joint skeleton extraction of common objects in a set of semantically similar images. Object skeletonization in real world images is a challenging problem, because there is no prior knowledge of the object's shape if we consider only a single image. This motivates us to resort to the idea of object co-skeletonization hoping that the commonness prior existing across the similar images may help, just as it does for other joint processing problems such as cosegmentation. Noting that skeleton can provide good scribbles for segmentation, and skeletonization, in turn, needs good segmentation, we propose a coupled framework for co-skeletonization and co-segmentation tasks so that they are well informed by each other, and benefit each other synergistically. Since it is a new problem, we also construct a benchmark dataset for the co-skeletonization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed method achieves very competitive results. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Data mining; Musculoskeletal system; Pattern recognition; Benchmark datasets; Co segmentations; Co-localizations; Joint processing; Object's shapes; Prior knowledge; Real-world image; Skeleton extraction; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Conf.

Student daily activity datasets are formed based on sensing capabilities of IoT nodes. Smart computing integrates hardware, software, and network technologies that provides systems with real-time situation awareness and automated analysis. The engineering student performance per session is calculated by combining the results from sensory nodes based education data mining algorithms and student academic datasets. Moreover, based on student sessional performance score, decisions are taken by management authority to increase the reputation score of the engineering institution. The experiment comprises two sections. In first section, RFID based experimental setup is defined with objects interaction patterns. In second section, student performance score generated using proposed system is compared with manual system.

Our results articulate the fact that an insightful textual query expansion always improves retrieval performance for both textual or image retrieval.

Though hyperspectral data gives accurate results than their multispectral counterparts, they are computationally more complex due to their high dimensionality. One of the classical problem while dealing with supervised hyperspectral classification is the class imbalance problem that arises due to the limited availability of samples for training. In order to deal with high dimensionality, many feature mining techniques has been proposed in literature for hyperspectral images. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral image classification method based on two-dimensional Empirical Wavelet Transform (2D-EWT) feature extraction and compare it with that of Image Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD) based extracted features and raw features. Here, the focus is upon the fact that the number of features trained should be less than what is to be tested. Since the computational time for classification is also of prime importance, only some of the fast and best of the classifiers are selected. Sparse-based classifiers are one of the fast and efficient method for supervised classification of hyperspectral images. Subspace Pursuit (SP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms are used in our experiments for sparse-based classification. Other classifiers used are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hybrid Support Vector Selection and Adaptation (HSVSA).

In the big data era, we are facing a diversity of datasets from different sources in different domains. These datasets consist of multiple modalities, each of which has a different representation, distribution, scale and density. Big data have volumes in range Exabyte's ten to the power of eighteen. A large number of data's are stored in Big Data storage every second. For instance in YouTube for every second a video of size 72 hours are being uploaded. It shows that big data have a big scope in handling of large data. Big data for learning, intelligence, data fusion, social network, mining and so many plays a vital role in it. The big data technologies along with machine learning algorithm have developed lots of advanced development in the field of social mining, network and social Medias. It has also developed so many challenges in data storage, handling, representation, mining, analysing the user behaviours and so many. In Social mining along with text the symbols are also analysed for effective mining of users. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems.

An outlier could be the key discovery to be made from large datasets and the insights gathered from them could be of significance in a wide variety of domains like information security, business intelligence, clinical decision support, financial monitoring etc. Recently, Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) driven approaches are shown as having good predictive accuracy. This paper proposes a novel low-complexity anomaly detection algorithm based on Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). The proposed algorithm reduces the complexity by avoiding the calculation of Lagrange multipliers of an objective function, instead locates an approximate pre-image of the SVDD sphere's center, within the input space itself. The crux of the training algorithm is a gradient descent of the primal objective function using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA). Experiments using datasets obtained from UCI machine learning repository have demonstrated that the accuracies of the proposed approach are comparable while the training time is much lesser than Classical SVDD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",One-class classification; Outlier detection; Scaling; SVDD,Approximation algorithms; Computational complexity; Data mining; Decision support systems; Lagrange multipliers; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Security of data; Statistics; Stochastic systems; Anomaly-detection algorithms; One-class Classification; Outlier Detection; Scaling; Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation; Support vector data description; SVDD; UCI machine learning repository; Data description,"A.G., R.; IT & Systems Area, Indian Institute of Management KozhikodeIndia; email: agrekha64@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019880831

An opinion is a statement about a subject which expresses the sentiments as well as the emotions of the opinion makers on the topic. In this paper, we develop a sentiment analysis tool namely SENTI-METER. This tool estimates the success rate of social campaigns based on the algorithms we developed that analyze the sentiment of word as well as blog. Social campaigns have a huge impact on the mindset of people. One such campaign was launched in India on October 2, 2014, named Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA). Our tool computes an elaborated analysis of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which examines the success rate of this social campaign. Here, we performed the location-wise analysis of the campaign and predict the degree of polarity of tweets along with the monthly and weekly analysis of the tweets. The experiments were conducted in five phases namely extraction and preprocessing of tweets, tokenization, sentiment evaluation of a line, sentiment evaluation of a blog (document) and analysis. Our tool is also capable of handling transliterated words. Unbiased tweets were extracted from Twitter related to this specific campaign, and on comparing with manual tagging we were able to achieve 84.47 % accuracy using unigram machine learning approach.

Because non-redressal of complaints eventually leads to customer churn, there is an urgent need to analyze the complaints. In this regard, we propose a novel descriptive analytics model that performs complaints/grievances analytics and summarizes the lengthy and verbose complaints concisely in a form that resembles association rules. The proposed hybrid model comprises fuzzy formal concept analysis and concept-level sentiment analysis (FFCA + SA) in tandem, which in turn is compared against formal concept analysis and concept-level sentiment analysis (FCA + SA). Because of the immediate fallout of the negative sentiments, a financial company is interested in studying them in more detail than the positive ones. Therefore, the model generates a list of ‘association rules’ the corresponding negative sentiment score along with the list of associated documents. Association rules are rank ordered according to the negative sentiment score, which in turn reflects severity affected services/products. The proposed model also provides interactive visualization that enables business analysts and managers to access a specific set of complaints without having to go through the entire set thoroughly. This saves a lot of time that would have otherwise been spent on cumbersome manual operations. Moreover, partial evaluation of the proposed methodology by human annotators yielded 64.06% matching score in terms of the opinions determination of aspects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Association rules; Customer complaints; Descriptive analytics; Fuzzy formal concept analysis; Sentiment analysis; Text mining,Association rules; Data mining; Finance; Information analysis; Natural language processing systems; Sales; Social networking (online); Visualization; Customer complaints; Descriptive analytics; Financial companies; Interactive visualizations; Negative sentiments; Products and services; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Formal concept analysis,"Ravi, V.; Center of Excellence in Analytics, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, Castle Hills Road No. 1, Masab Tank, India; email: rav_padma@yahoo.com",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed. © 2017",Humanitarian logistics; Humanitarian supply chain management; Information technology; Supply chain management; Technology adoption; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,Data mining; Information technology; Personnel training; Societies and institutions; Supply chain management; Behavioural intentions; Facilitating conditions; Humanitarian logistics; Personal innovativeness; Structural equation modelling; Technology adoption; Trust in technologies; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Engineering education,"Kabra, G.; Department of Operations Management, Xavier Institute of ManagementIndia; email: kabraiiitm@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,7365853,,TEINE,,English,Telematics Inf,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020840838

In case of high-end priced products, the demand is seasonal and sensitive. The investment involves high risk and revenues vary beyond fathomable bounds. The primary objective of this research is to present a decision-support system for retail pricing and revenue optimization of these retail products. The sales data of past 2.5 years from prominent retail stores across 45 different regions has been used to develop this study. A regression tree/random forest-based machine learning algorithm is used to predict weekly demand. It incorporates price, holidays, discounts, inventory and other regional factors in decision making. Following this, the demand-price interdependencies are quantified and integrated into an integer linear programming model for optimal price allocation. This methodology has been implemented on offline retailing of expensive products which generally follow high variation in demand. The expected revenue has been optimized by branch & bound and branch & cut method, followed by root node analysis.

When we consider a huge network, we have to process a large amount of network information generated, which consists of both normal and abnormal activity logs in large volume of multi-dimensional data. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to monitor the network and to detect the malicious nodes and activities in the network. Massive amount of data makes it difficult to detect threats and attacks. Sequential Pattern mining may be used to identify the patterns of malicious activities which have been an emerging popular trend due to the consideration of quantities, profits and time orders of item.

The processing applications are inadequate to deal with these data are termed as BigData since in large amounts. In this work, an initial stage for analysing medical informatics using R-studio by R programming is attempted by two algorithms. The biomedical data is used because they are concerned with the real time usage and is an open access journal aiming to facilitate the presentation, validation, use, and re-use of datasets, and can be modifiable with focus on publishing biomedical datasets that can serve as a source for simulation and computational modelling of diseases and biological processes. Random forest technique and support vector machine (SVM) techniques are used to derive features from the database and are able to differentiate various disease supports. The aim of this paper is to provide a comparison between the various techniques that are involved in the field of sorting the data and analysing them in large numbers. For this the process of data mining is used. Data mining is the process of extracting valuable information from a large set of databases. The latter technique produces more appropriate results that has less deviation from the reference taken from the hepatitis profile.

Generally, in large conversational dataset like Twitter it is very difficult to identifying public health-related topics. Machine learning is the area which helps us to overcome this situation. By applying probabilistic unsupervised machine learning we have identified latent topics from the text corpora. Topic modeling algorithms are probabilistic generative models which is used to analyze the words of the original texts to identify themes that run through them, how connected to each other by themes, and how the topics change over (Blei in Commun ACM 55(4):77–84, 2012). In this paper we have proposed a framework for recommending health-related topics by applying an enhanced topic model hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation for identifying public health-related topics and themes in tweets. We have tested our model by exploring tobacco usage across conversational data, as well as tested with the subset of data generated by tobacco related queries. Our test results indicate most of the public health related issues are uncovered in our model.

Advantage of online examination is automation in evaluation process and thereby removing the personal bias towards the students. For this purpose, academic institutions are using Learning Management Systems extensively. Moodle, the open-source learning management system is mostly preferred. It is another option to proprietary online learning solutions. In fact, student's performance cannot be evaluated and assessed only by right and wrong answers in online examination. In proposed experiment an attempt is made to make the examination assessment intelligent. Data mining which is very popularly used in various domains including business but less explored in academic domain. It can be effectively used to mine data generated from e-learning systems.

Space-borne Hyperion data was acquired for two different dates (October, 2006 & January, 2011). Endmembers were picked up from highest percentage occupancy of a class. Classification was performed on a combination of bands coming from specific absorptive features of endmember spectra (VIS (458nm-702nm) and SWIR-I (1548nm-1780nm)). SFF & SAM were applied on two identified band combinations a) 25bands (VIS) & b) 49 bands (VIS+SWIR-I). SFF was performed on Continuum Removed (CR) spectra and SAM on Continuum Intact (CI) spectra. Overall accuracy (OAA) levels were different for the two band combinations, two algorithms and also for the two images. For October data, SFF gave 61% and 49% OAA using VIS+SWIR-1 bands and VIS bands respectively. The SAM classifier performed better for both the selected spectral regions (70% and 67% respectively). SAM showed better performance with 68% using VIS bands and SFF gave good OAA (56%) with VIS+SWIR-1 band combination for January data. Results indicate that OAA defers with changes in the phenology of vegetation cover. Endmember spectra worked well in classifying images coming from two different acquisition dates. © 2013 IEEE.",Band selection; Endmember extraction; Hyperion EO-1 data; Spectral Angle Mapper; Spectral Feature Fitting; Tropical Forest,Extraction; Forestry; Image processing; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Tropics; Band selection; Endmember extraction; Hyperion; Spectral angle mappers; Spectral feature fitting; Tropical forest; Data mining,,,IEEE Computer Society,21586276,9.78151E+12,,,English,Workshop Hyperspectral Image Signal Proces.: Evol.

This multimodal content contains information on various issues such as terrorism, child pornography, product reviews and much more. Censoring on-line data that promotes unethical activities globally cannot be done manually. This has generated the need for a tool which can automatically determine the central idea expressed in the video and also categorize it into different emotion labels. When classifying audio video content into different class labels, audio-visual features are highly interdependent. Naive Bayes classification model fails to classify them correctly. In this paper, we propose and have implemented, in the form of a web interface, a novel approach for performing efficient multimodal sentiment analysis of online videos using machine learning algorithm - Perplexed Bayes classification technique, which takes care of the inter-dependency among the features. The interface displays the emotion label - happy, sad or neutral depending on the content of the video, the degree of emotion and the keywords related to the uploaded video. Further, Perplexed Bayes classifier has been proved to give 28% better results than Naive Bayes classifier. © 2017 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK.",Audio features; Component; Facial features; Perplexed Bayes classifier; Regex tagger; Sentiment analysis,Automation; Classifiers; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Audio features; Bayes Classifier; Component; Facial feature; Regex tagger; Sentiment analysis; Modal analysis,,Zhang J.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.7807E+12,,,English,ICAC - IEEE Int.

The Primitive algorithms which are used take Polynomial Time for computing such vector problems which are not fruitful for us, on the other hand, Quantum algorithms have the capability to solve such vector problems in a considerable amount of time by using Quantum-Mechanical operations. For example, we can perform a Database Search in a time which is Quadratic-ally faster than the primitive search algorithm. Quantum Algorithms rely on Quantum physics and therefore the algorithms are Incoherent in nature and this property makes them more interesting to study. In this paper, we provide the insights of Quantum Machine Learning and we formally prove that the Execution Time of the algorithm is greatly optimized with the help of Adiabatic Quantum Learning.

The available resources in web are used by the users and also they involve in giving feedbacks and thus generate additional information. It is very essential to explore, analyze and organize their opinions and feedbacks in an efficient way for better decision making. So sentiment analysis (SA) is used to find the users opinion about a particular topic, product or problem in a more efficient way. The main aim of SA is to solve the problems in relation to opinions about products, movies, politics, review sites etc. Sentiment analysis can be done with different modalities by taking inputs from text, image, audio and video. This paper proposes a system that will automatically recognise the facial expression from the image and classify emotions for final decision. The system uses a simplified method called 'Viola Jones Face Detection' algorithm for face localization. Then facial features are extracted using three methods 'Zernike moments', 'LBP' and 'DCT transform'. The different feature vectors are combined together using a subset feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of recognition and classification process. Finally the combined features are trained and classified using SVM, Random Forest and KNN classifier. Experiments are conducted on JAFFE database and finally performance of the system is evaluated. © 2017 IEEE.",DCT transform; JAFFE database; KNN; LBP; Sentiment analysis; SVM Classifier; Viola Jones; Zernike moment,Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Discrete cosine transforms; Feature extraction; DCT transform; Jaffe database; Sentiment analysis; SVM classifiers; Viola jones; Zernike moments; Face recognition,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In order to understand the characteristic features of the journey made by objects, appropriate mining techniques are essential. Many of the existing trajectory mining applications use geographic features precisely location and time for the pattern identification. Mining of data by considering more parameters will identify divergent locations of interest in the trajectory. The concept of semantic trajectory analysis is gaining acceptance in the domain of trajectory analysis.

To improve the accuracy of classification, many algorithms have been proposed earlier, but they suffer from poor classification accuracy and more false classification ratio. To overcome this issue, a multi attribute depthness similarity estimation technique to classify the data points towards the number of classes has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method takes the dataset and data points grouped by using labels. This method performs preprocessing by removing the noisy data points. It identifies distinct attributes of each class which has more importance among the data points. Based on identified attribute sets, this method computes multi attribute depthness similarity for each of the data points towards each class. The class which has more depthness value will be assigned as a class to the input data point.

The leading social media like Twitter and Facebook produce a huge volume of information through its microblogs. The number of microblogs produced in every minute by these services is so large that the old information use to be buried under the streaming information. Moreover, sometimes the messages of these services are not organized, complete, structured and relevant to the exact topic for which it becomes difficult for the users to find the exact information they are searching for. So in this paper, we have proposed a framework to organize the microblogs in clusters and give each cluster a meaningful label. The difficulty in clustering and labelling microblogs is that they are very shortand sometimes even incomplete for what it is not easy to understand the actual meaning of the message. The traditional text mining methods fail to establish the semantic relationship between the words.

Owing to its open architecture and large user base, it provides the developers with an open access to its code base and a large surface area to launch their malicious activities. This paper presents an approach to perform dynamic analysis of android applications to classify the applications as malicious or non malicious. To this end we have developed a syscall-capture system which collects and extracts the system call traces of all the applications during their run-time interactions with the phone platform. Subsequently all the collected system call data is aggregated and analysed to detect and classify the behaviour of Android applications. We have used our system to analyse the behaviour of 50 malicious applications obtained from the Android Malware Genome Project and 50 benign applications obtained from the Google Play Store. With the aim to classify the behaviour of these applications, we have considered the frequency of system calls made by each application as the prime feature set. To this effect we have achieved an acceptable levels of accuracy in correctly classifying the application as malicious or benign using the J48 Decision Tree algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",Android; Benign; Classification; Dynamic Analysis; Malicious; Malware Detection; System call,Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Dynamic analysis; Intrusion detection; Malware; Android; Benign; Malicious; Malware detection; System calls; Android (operating system),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The Big data is huge amount of variety of data, and the data is increasing very rapidly according to the time. So there is need to process that data and instead of just storing that data need to extract some meaningful information or knowledge from that data applying some clustering and classification techniques of data mining. There are various era available in the Big Data so that decided the medical field first. And after that there are various diseases available to work on them or gain some knowledge or predict for help we decided the Heart disease. Heart disease is one of the disease due to that death will occurred mostly, and according to the world health organization the percentage is more for that. So Heart disease is decided for the big Data approach, and as Big Data is considered so used Hadoop Map reduce platform. For clustering Improved K-Means and for the classification purpose decision tree algorithm i.e. ID3 is used in the hybrid approach. As we know the taking second opinion is too increased, the system is very useful for the helping in prediction, basis on the some parameters like chest pain, cholesterol, age, resting Bp, Thalac and many more. Due to this system clinical decision making will be improved as well as being fast. It's also will impact on the improving the treatment process. In such way it will be very useful in the prediction of the heart disease. © 2017 IEEE.",Big Data; Classification; Clustering; Data mining; ID3; Improved K-Means; Map reduce,Big data; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision trees; Diseases; Forecasting; Heart; Information management; Trees (mathematics); Classification technique; Clinical decision making; Clustering; Decision-tree algorithm; K-means; Map-reduce; Prediction systems; World Health Organization; Data mining,"Mane, T.U.; Department of Computer Engineering, Zeal College of Engineering and ResearchIndia; email: tejaswinimane18@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

One of the most important and challenging issue in the data stream domain is the classification of the big datasets. However the conventional classification methods developed to run in a streaming environment with high use of memory constraints and longer execution running time. Another three major important issues in the data stream classification methods are huge length, conception drift and Feature Selection (FS). In this review paper, we consider the difficult problem of FS algorithms for streaming data, in which the size of streaming data for the feature set is unknown, primary to an inflexible demand in computation constraints, and not every feature is available from classifier model. In order to solve this difficulty, Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms are performed on the high dimensionality and streaming big dataset samples which result in increase classification accuracy, less memory consumption and lesser running time when compared to the existing streaming FS algorithms on various datasets. The proposed SI based FS algorithms overcomes the difficulty of the traditional FS algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Big data; Data Stream Mining; Data streams classification; Feature Selection (FS); metaheuristics; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Swarm Intelligence (SI),Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Signal processing; Swarm intelligence; Classification accuracy; Conventional classification methods; Data stream; Data stream classifications; Data stream mining; Feature selection algorithm; Hardware and software; Meta heuristics; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This mainly corresponds to the bulk of information which was easily embedded on each hyperspectral image. A large number of kernel based techniques were formulated and used in this regard. Since the dimension of the hyperspectral image (HSI) is very large, conventional image processing and classification methods does not have an emphasizing effect on feature extraction. This paper compares the performance of various classification algorithms such as kernel based methods implemented using LibSVM and GURLS and sparsity based algorithm known as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The assessment is done based on HSI classification accuracy. The experiment is conducted on standard dataset namely Indian Pines procured by the AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer). These algorithms can handle the entire dimensionality by taking the total number of classes into account, to retain information potential and effectively differentiate classes with sharp spectral differences. Based on the analysis of experiments undertaken, the study pinpoints to LIBSVM as a better classifier to OMP and GURLS being the best of the three. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; GURLS; Hyperspectral Image; Kernal methods; LIBSVM; OMP,Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Data mining; Extraction; Hyperspectral imaging; Image processing; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometers; Classification algorithm; Extraction of information; GURLS; Hyper-spectral imageries; Kernal methods; LIBSVM; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Image classification,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Due to fast changing contents of database one needs an algorithm which is real time. The major drawback of Apriori algorithm is that, it needs to scan main database each and every time to generate frequent patterns which results in more usage of memory and execution time, hence in order to reduce execution time and usage of memory a lot of research has been conducted to improve Apriori Algorithm. Towards improving Apriori, a modified version is proposed in this paper to generate frequent patterns. This enables finding patterns rather than going back to the database at every pass. This limits the number of scan and also the number of total combinations is brought down from 2N to 2N-2.

Opinion classification is the process of identifying the positive, negative and neutral opinion from the text. The traditional data mining software tools find it difficult to manage the reviews because of its size. Hence, to provide an efficient big data opinion mining, an efficient Inclusive Similarity based Clustering (ISC) algorithm is proposed. During pre-processing the data is cleaned with Parts of Speech (PoS) tagger and sliced by using the proposed Threshold based Data Partitioning (TDP) algorithm. After pre-processing the dataset, the inclusive similarity algorithm computes the similarity between the consecutive reviews and constructs an adjacency matrix. The proposed ISC algorithm exploits the adjacency matrix and merges the clusters into a single cluster. The performance of the proposed method is validated with the existing algorithms for the metrics such as time consumption, memory utility and accuracy.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM accounts for about 80-90% of all diagnosed adult cases of diabetes. Most present diagnostic methods for T2DM are black-box models, which are unable to provide the reasons underlying diagnosis to physicians therefore, algorithms that can provide further insight are needed. Rule extraction can provide such explanations. The extracted rules may not be only highly accurate, but also simple and easy to understand. Therefore in the study, The rule extraction algorithm is proposed for Enhancing regular covering technique(ERCT) to achieve highly accurate, concise, and interpretable classification rules for the pima Indian diabetes(PID) dataset, which comprises 768 samples with two classes(diabetes or non-diabetes) and eight continuous attributes. The result of the proposed algorithm is an average accuracy of 85.55% after 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation. Regular covering technique achieved substantially better accuracy and provided a considerably fewer average number of rules and antecedents. These results suggest that proposed algorithm, and are therefore more suitable for medical decision making including the diagnosis of all type of diabetes mellitus. © 2017 IEEE.",Data mining; Pima Indian diabetes; Regular Covering; Rule Extraction; sampling selection; Type 2 Diabetes mellitus,Classification (of information); Decision making; Diagnosis; Extraction; Pima Indian Diabetes; Regular Covering; Rule extraction; Sampling selections; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

In this research, an in-depth analysis of Task Difficulty Level (TDL) for program comprehension is proposed with features extracted from different areas of the brain. Two levels of task difficulty were analysed: easy and difficult. Eight students were asked to solve nine Java programs of different difficulty level and the subject's cognitive load was recorded using EEG. Four different feature extraction methods were used for analysis - Energy, Frequency ratio, Event Related De-Synchronization (ERD) and Asymmetry ratio and Naïve Bayes classifier was used for classifying different TDL. The results indicated that the recorded EEG signals could reflect TDL for program comprehension tasks for predicting easy and difficult tasks. The classifier predicted task difficulty (easy/difficult) of a new task with an overall correctly classified accuracy of 76.55% with a precision of 80.03% and recall of 76.66%.

This work is based on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) which predicts the sentiment of aspects mentioned in the text documents. The extracted aspects are fine-grained for the presentation form known as Review Highlights. The syntactic approach for extraction process suffers from the overlapping chunking rules which result in noise extraction. We introduce a hybrid technique which combines machine learning and rule based model. A multi-label classifier identifies the effective rules which efficiently parse aspects and opinions from texts. This selection of rules reduce the amount of noise in extraction tasks. This is a novel attempt to learn syntactic rule fitness from a corpus using machine learning for accurate aspect extraction. As the model learns the syntactic rule prediction from the corpus, it makes the extraction method domain independent. It also allows studying the quality of syntactic rules in a different corpus. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This paper highlights the application of classifying and predicting a specific disease by implementing the operations on medical data generated in the field of medical and healthcare. In this project an efficient multiclass Naïve Bayes algorithm is used for prediction of a particular disease by training it on a set of data before implementation. Wrong clinical decisions taken by medical practitioners can cause any harm or result in serious loss of life of a patient which is hard to afford by any hospital. To acquire a precise and cost effective treatment, technology based Data Mining Systems can be constructed to make worthy decisions. The main aim of this project is to build a basic decision support system which can determine and extract previously unseen patterns, relations and concepts related with multiple disease from a historical database records of specified multiple diseases. The proposed system can solve difficult queries for detecting a particular disease and also can assist medical practitioners to make smart clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems were not able to. The decisions taken by medical practitioners with the help of technology can result in effective and low cost treatments. There is an insufficiency of technology and analysis system and methods to discover connections, concepts and patterns in the medical data. Data mining is an engineering study of extracting previously undiscovered patterns from a selected set of data. In this paper, data mining methods namely, Naive Bayes and J48 algorithms are compared for testing their accuracy and performance on the training medical datasets. The medical datasets will be visualized by different visualization techniques like 2D/3D graphs, pie charts and other methods. The algorithms mentioned above are compared and evaluated on basis of their accuracy and time consumption factors. The algorithm which gives out high accuracy in the comparative study is selected for implementation for developing the system. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Datasets; Decision tree; Genetic Algorithm; Naive Bayes; Prediction,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Cost effectiveness; Data visualization; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Medical computing; Trees (mathematics); Visualization; Comparative studies; Cost effective treatments; Data mining methods; Datasets; Historical database; Medical practitioner; Naive bayes; Visualization technique; Data mining,,Niranjan Dr.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Most of the crimes get reported and a massive dataset is being generated every year. Analysing the crime reports can help the law enforcement section to take preventive measures for reducing the crime, but processing this voluminous data is strenuous and error-prone. So application of various text mining techniques can be of great help for visualising the crime trend. The present work proposes an effective methodology for analysing crime against women in India. The work involves extracting crime reports from online newspaper articles and the documents consisting crime reports of various states and union territories of India are made to undergo several preprocessing techniques. Each document is treated as bag-of-words and finally an exhaustive list of words have been prepared. Similarity has been measured among the words for selecting relevant features for crime trend analysis. Based on the selected crime features, community detection algorithm has been applied for partitioning the states based on crime against women in India. It is a graph based clustering approach and all the states of India have been considered as nodes of the graph. Each community is a group of states which are similar based on crime trends. The work also gives a new direction of application of the algorithm with certain limitations for incremental datasets where data are being generated regularly. The present methodology compares with some existing feature selection methods and clusters obtained in each method using same algorithm are evaluated which shows that the proposed method is more accurate than the existing methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Community detection; Crime analysis; Feature selection; Graph clustering; Similarity measurement; Text mining,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Clustering algorithms; Crime; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Newsprint; Population dynamics; Websites; Community detection; Community detection algorithms; Feature selection methods; Graph clustering; Preprocessing techniques; Similarity measurements; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Computer crime,,Niranjan Dr.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The datasets are mostly high dimensional due to the advancements in information and communication technologies. Feature selection is an important dimensionality reduction technique to manage the 'curse of dimensionality'. The subset of features selected in subsequent iterations of feature selection algorithms must be same or at least similar for the small perturbations of the experimental dataset. The robustness of feature selection algorithms is called as the feature selection stability. High data quality with security/privacy is the major requirement of good privacy preserving data mining technique.

Android's current risk communication mechanism relies on users to understand the permissions that an app is requesting and to base the installation decision on the list of permissions. The users do not understand or consider the permission information as it requires technical knowledge. The Android's main safeguarding mechanism against malicious apps is the risk communication mechanism where usually any user installs the app, is being warned about the permissions the application would require and the user has to make the rightful decision. For mobile devices, one often downloads and uses many applications (or apps) with limited functionality from multiple unknown vendors. Therefore, the defense against malicious applications must depend to a large degree on decisions made by the users.

Due to this, the traditional signature-based methods for detection of malware effectively becomes an obsolete method. The efficiency of the machine learning model in context to the detection of malware files has been proved by different researches and studies. In this paper, a framework has been developed to detect and classify different files (e.g exe, pdf, php, etc.) as benign and malicious using two level classifier namely, Macro (for detection of malware) and Micro (for classification of malware files as a Trojan, Spyware, Adware, etc.). Cuckoo Sandbox is used for generating static and dynamic analysis report by executing files in the virtual environment. In addition, a novel model is developed for extracting features based on static, behavioral and network analysis using analysis report generated by the Cuckoo Sandbox. Weka Framework is used to develop machine learning models by using training datasets. The experimental results using proposed framework shows high detection rate with an accuracy of 100% using J48 Decision tree model, 99% using SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) and 97% using Random Forest tree. It also shows effective classification rate with accuracy 100% using J48 Decision tree, 91% using SMO and 66% using Random Forest tree. These results are used for detecting and classifying unknown files as benign or malicious. 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cuckoo Sandbox; Dynamic Analysis; Malware Classification; Malware Detection; SMO; Static,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer viruses; Data mining; Decision trees; Dynamic analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machinery; Optimization; Security of data; Virtual reality; Cuckoo Sandbox; Decision tree modeling; Machine learning models; Malware classifications; Malware detection; Sequential minimal optimization; Static; Static and dynamic analysis; Malware,,Dhaka V.S.Elci A.Gaur M.S.Bohra M.K.Shekhawat R.S.,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

In this way extraction of spatial patterns from crowdsourced data has become most valuable for service suppliers. These patterns represent the spatial features of the co-related objects. The existing approaches used Dijkstras algorithm and Euclidean distance to find spatial patterns which can not compute accurately. Crowdsourced data is growing on daily basis through mobile phones, road networks and remote sensors. In order to process this type of large data set is also becoming difficult. In this research work we have proposed a system to process crowdsourced data taken from OpenStreetMap to mine the useful patterns using SpatialHadoop. SpatialHadoop has used Pigeon script, a spatial extension to Pig that is a high level language. These patterns will assist service providers to offer different sites based on facilities. In this extraction method, spatial data is loaded into the system and filtered for nodes, ways and relations. The filtered data is used for the mining process by using kNN joins. After this the evaluation of multiple resolution pruning filter with spatial datasets are generated using argument values. The different data sets have been checked using this methodology to extract the spatial patterns. This technique is compared with PostgreSQL and it is observed that SDM has provided more efficient results. The result obtained from experiment has shown the performance of our system that is better in comparison to the already existing systems in consideration of efficiency, speed and accuracy that rely on a network. © 2017 IEEE.",OSM; Pigeon; Spatial Data Mining; SpatialHadoop,Computer programming languages; Extraction; Filtration; High level languages; Remote sensing; Space division multiple access; Euclidean distance; Extraction method; Multiple resolutions; Pigeon; Service provider; Spatial data mining; Spatial extension; SpatialHadoop; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Generally people use Google to search their queries and that search engine respond them with the answer but that answer is in scattered format. User not gets exact answer for his / her queries. So we are going to implement this paper. Here we propose a novel deep learning scheme to infer the disease according to questions of health seekers. In this work we first analyze and categorize needs of health seekers and ask for manifested symptoms for disease prediction. Then user will search for their query. Then the query get processed to give prediction of disease to the user or health seekers. Here concept of hidden layers is get used. First medical signatures mines from raw features. These features and signatures deems as input node in one layer and hidden nodes in subsequent layer.

It classifies the text into positive, negative or neutral. Lexicon-based and Supervised Machine Learning-based are the two main approaches in sentiment analysis. Bag-of-words model is used to represent the text as a vector of independent words and machine learning algorithms are used for classification. Polarity shift is the major problem in the Bag-of-words model. Polarity shift is a sentiment classification problem. It can reverse the sentiment polarity of the text. Classification performance of machine learning based systems can get affected by polarity shift. Negation is the type of polarity shift. Negative words can change the polarity of the sentimental words. Polarity shift detection methods are used to detect the polarity shift in the sentences. It helps to improve the performance of machine learning classification algorithms. Natural Language Processing can be used for feature extraction and classification. Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing for extraction of opinion words from the text. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in identifying the opinion of the people about a specific topic or entity.

A number of theoretical and practical solutions to query processing have been proposed under various scenarios. With the recent popularity of cloud computing, data owners now have the opportunity to outsource not only their data but also data processing functionalities to the cloud. Because of data security and personal privacy concerns, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) should be encrypted before being outsourced to a cloud, and the cloud should perform query processing tasks on the encrypted data only. These tasks are termed as Privacy Preserving Query Processing (PPQP) over encrypted data. These protocols protect the confidentiality of the stored data, user queries, and data access patterns from cloud service providers and other unauthorized users. Several queries were considered in an attempt to create a well-defined scope. These queries included the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query, advanced analytical query, and correlated range query.

As data are continuously evolving entire dataset cannot be scanned. So data under a particular window are scanned for finding frequent patterns. Among different window models available, sliding window is the most popular as it focuses more on recent data. However sliding window model suffers with a problem of false negatives i.e. some items which are frequent are shown as infrequent. This problem occurs as boundary frequent elements are not detected. The novel algorithm proposed EHBFS efficiently handles this problem and finds frequent patterns on stream data with more accuracy.

Due to its enormous growth, any individual can become a member in any of these online social networking sites. Consequently, these websites gain huge profit just by providing a platform for the users to communicate. Online social networks, such as Facebook, LinkedIn are progressively utilized by many people. It makes digital communication technologies sharpening tools for extending the social circle of people. It has already become an important integral part of our daily lives, enabling us to contact our friends and families on time. As social networks have developed rapidly, recent research has begun to explore social networks to understand their structure, advertising and marketing, and data mining online population, representing 1.2 billion users around the world. More and more social network data has been made publicly available and analyzed in one way or another. But some of the information revealed is meant to be private hence social network data has led to the risk of leakage of confidential information of individuals. This is because they collect huge personal data and users take risks of trusting them. It is possible to use learning algorithms on released data to predict private information. Privacy preservation is a significant research issue in social networking. Since more personalized information is shared with the public, violating the privacy of a target user become much easier. This paper explains the possibility of various inference attacks by these private data. These attacks can be minimized by sanitization methods that are put forward in this paper. We explore how to launch inference attacks using released social networking data to predict private information. This paper also comes with the security features which are essential for an online social networking site. The research in this field is still in its early years.

Public health has become a cause for concern for many nations. Countries such as India among others have launched several initiatives in recent years with the aim to improve public health. However, these initiatives always face the problem of allocating scarce resources to a large number of patients. One method to overcome this issue is through the use of mHealth technologies that can provide a variety of health-related services anywhere, anytime in a cost-effective manner. However, mHealth too faces the same issues as other information and communication technology projects such as lack of infrastructure and usability issues. For this reason, despite its potential, most mHealth projects still remain in the pilot stage. The study analyses 54 mHealth projects conducted in developing nations between 2011 and 2016 across multiple databases. To maintain accuracy and objectivity of results a text-mining approach is followed. The results of the analysis are then used to create questions for structured interviews which are conducted with different stakeholders of an mHealth project operated in Ahmedabad, India. The daily operations of the system are also observed. The interviews and observations of the functioning of the system are then analyzed using Atlas.ti. The results of this analysis are reconciled with the results of the text-mining to create a framework that governs the implementation and operation of mHealth projects in developing nations. The framework found seven key areas that influenced a mHealth project-infrastructure, design, personnel, end-user, value, public policy and finances. Thereafter, a review of management and technology literature across these dimensions was conducted to develop recommendations for successful implementation of projects along these seven dimensions identified in the framework. © 2017 IEEE.",Mobile Health; Stakeholder Empowerment; Technology Management,"Cost effectiveness; Data mining; Developing countries; Health; Health care; Public health; Ahmedabad , india; Developing nations; Empirical studies; Information and Communication Technologies; Mobile Health (M-Health); Project infrastructure; Stakeholder Empowerment; Technology managements; mHealth",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"RTSI - IEEE Int.

Sampling rate of the data stream is 30 frames per second where every frame represents a body gesture. The overall system is bifurcated into two parts. The offline part calculates 19 features from each frame representing a diseased gesture. These features are angle and distance information between 20 body joints. Features correspond to a definite pattern for a specific body gesture. In online part, triangular fuzzy matching based algorithm performs to detect real-time gestures with 90.57% accuracy. For achieving better accuracy, decision tree is enforced to separate sitting and standing body gestures.

The discovery of these associations helps the retailers to develop marketing strategies, make business decisions and maximize the profits. Several strategies have been proposed to push several types of constraints within the most well known algorithms in the context of mining frequent itemsets. In the present paper an effective FP-Bonsai algorithm is implemented for mining frequent patterns. According to the mining result, the products are arranged together to well-suite the customer's needs and interests.

The big data referred here is the massive amount of digital data generated in each and every second in structured, semi-structured and unstructured format throughout the world. This emerging field of big data analytic has driven the researcher worldwide toward design, development and implementation of various tools, technologies, architecture and platforms for analyzing the huge volume of data generated day to day. Big data consist of data sets which is difficult for legacy database management system to analysis. This paper details some analysis like feedback analysis, sentiment analysis and word-count. Feedback are important for the system enhancement, finding loop holes and as well as for proper work distribution. Feedback is valuable information that will be used to make good decision. Feedback is important not only when it highlights weaknesses but also for strengths. If analysis of feedback is done in wrong way then the result of analysis will also be wrong. As a result, the pattern identified will also be incorrect thus making the whole system incorrect as a whole. We will be implementing this proposed system for feedback analysis using Map-Reduce framework for processing large data set and for storage we will use Hadoop. © 2017 IEEE.",Feedback analysis; Hadoop; Map-Reduce; Naive Bayes; Sentiment analysis; Word-count,Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Information management; Internet of things; Feedback analysis; Hadoop; Map-reduce; Naive bayes; Sentiment analysis; Word-count; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Brain MRI classification into normal and abnormal has received increasing attention because of the high level of difficulty in handling those huge numbers of images. Recently, many computational techniques are widely employed to segregate the normal images from pathological. Thus, this study has attempted to analyse the capability of various supervised data mining techniques in classifying the brain MR images. Initially, the images are pre-processed and the volumetric features are extracted. Then, these are fed into feature selection techniques viz. Principal Component Analysis, Runs, Fisher filtering and ReliefF feature selection to determine relevant features. The selected features are utilised for the supervised data mining techniques viz. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Tree and C4.5 to identify the abnormal images of brain. Among them, SVM has achieved highest accuracy of 71.33% with the features extracted through ReliefF feature selection with Leave-One-Out cross validation. Random Tree achieved accuracy of 82% with Runs filtered features. The classification will aid the segmentation of brain tumor from large set of MRI slices by eliminating the normal slices. This greatly reduces the computational time and memory required for the process of segmentation. © 2017 IEEE.",Brain Tumor; Classification; Data Mining; Machine Learning Challenge; Magnetic Resonance Images,Brain; Computation theory; Computational methods; Data mining; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image classification; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Principal component analysis; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Tumors; Accurate prediction; Brain tumors; Computational technique; Computational time and memory; Leave-one-out cross validations; Level of difficulties; Selection techniques; Volumetric features; Classification (of information),,Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

In this paper, we have incorporated wrapper based subset selection technique for selecting a subset from the high dimensional datasets. In this approach to find the optimal threshold value, the feature subsets are given to the classifier iteratively until the maximum accuracy is obtained. The symmetrical uncertainty method is used to weight the features to predict the predominant feature. For validating the incorporated algorithm, we have used 10-fold cross validation against the two standard classification techniques such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the results are tabulated and compared.

Generation of large data sets demand for a high performance search algorithm in areas such as text mining, information retrieval and many others. The popularity of GPU’s for general purpose computing has been increasing for various applications. Therefore it is of great interest to exploit the thread feature of a GPU to provide a high performance search algorithm. This paper proposes an optimized new approach to N-gram model for string search in a number of lengthy documents and its GPU implementation. The algorithm exploits GPGPUs for searching strings in many documents employing character level N-gram matching with parallel Score Table approach and search using CUDA API. The new approach of Score table used for frequency storage of N-grams in a document, makes the search independent of the document’s length and allows faster access to the frequency values, thus decreasing the search complexity. The extensive thread feature in a GPU has been exploited to enable parallel pre-processing of trigrams in a document for Score Table creation and parallel search in huge number of documents, thus speeding up the whole search process even for a large pattern size. Experiments were carried out for many documents of varied length and search strings from the standard Lorem Ipsum text on NVIDIA’s GeForce GT 540M GPU with 96 cores. Results prove that the parallel approach for Score Table creation and searching gives a good speed up than the same approach executed serially. © 2017, The Institution of Engineers (India).",CUDA; GPGPU; N-gram; NVIDIA; Score table; String matching; String searching; Trigram,Big data; Data mining; Digital storage; Graphics processing unit; Learning algorithms; Program processors; CUDA; GPGPU; N-grams; NVIDIA; Score table; String matching; String-searching; Tri grams; String searching algorithms,"Srinivasa, K.G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, M.S.

High-utility itemset mining is an emerging research area in the field of data mining and has important applications in inventory management, query recommendation, systems operation research, bio-medical analysis, etc. Currently, known algorithms for this problem can be classified as either 1-phase or 2-phase algorithms. The 2-phase algorithms typically consist of tree-based algorithms which generate candidate high-utility itemsets and verify them later. A tree data structure generates candidate high-utility itemsets quickly by storing some upper bound utility estimate at each node. The 1-phase algorithms typically consist of inverted-list based and transaction projection based algorithms which avoid the generation of candidate high-utility itemsets. The inverted list and transaction projection allows computation of exact utility estimates. We propose a novel hybrid framework that combines a tree-based and an inverted-list based algorithm to efficiently mine high-utility itemsets. Algorithms based on the framework can harness benefits of both types of algorithms.

The tweets provided by the Twitter Firehose reveal the properties of big data (i.e. volume, variety, and velocity). With millions of users on Twitter, the Twitter's virtual communities are now replicating the real-world communities. Consequently, the discussions of real world events are also very often on Twitter. This work has performed the real-time analysis of the tweets related to a targeted event (e.g. election) to identify those potential sub-events that occurred in the real world, discussed over Twitter and cause the significant change in the aggregated sentiment score of the targeted event with time. Such type of analysis can enrich the real-time decision-making ability of the event bearer. The proposed approach utilizes a threestep process: (1) Real-time sentiment analysis of tweets (2) Application of Bayesian Change Points Detection to determine the sentiment change points (3) Major sub-events detection that have influenced the sentiment of targeted event.

It has been broadly researched in recent years. The property of sarcasm that makes it harder to detect is the gap between the literal and its intended meaning. It is a particular kind of sentiment which is capable of flipping the entire sense of a text. Sarcasm is often expressed verbally through the use of high pitch with heavy tonal stress. The other clues of sarcasm are the usage of various gestures such as gently sloping of eyes, hands movements, shaking heads, etc. However, the appearances of these clues for sarcasm are absent in textual data which makes the detection of sarcasm dependent upon several other factors. In this article, six algorithms were proposed to analyze the sarcasm in tweets of Twitter. These algorithms are based on the possible occurrences of sarcasm in tweets. Finally, the experimental results of the proposed algorithms were compared with some of the existing state-of-the-art.

Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK.

In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to diverging conclusions.

NWC discovery is important for societal applications such as eco-friendly transportation (e.g. identifying engine signatures leading to high greenhouse gas emissions). Challenges of designing a scalable algorithm for NWC discovery include the non-monotonicity of popular spatio-temporal statistical interest measures of association such as the cross-K function which renders the anti-monotone pruning based algorithms (e.g. Apriori) inapplicable for such interest measures. In our preliminary work, we proposed two upper bounds for the cross-K function and a top-down multi-parent tracking approach that uses these bounds for filtering out uninteresting candidate patterns and then applies a minimum support (i.e. frequency) threshold as a post-processing step to filter out chance patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional pruning approach (BDNMiner) that combines top-down pruning based on the cross-K function threshold with bottom-up pruning based on the minimum support threshold to efficiently mine NWC patterns. Case studies with real world engine data demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach to discover patterns which are interesting to engine scientists. Experimental evaluation on real-world data show that the proposed approach yields substantial computational savings compared to prior work. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Co-occurrence patterns; Temporal data mining; Transportation,Data mining; Engines; Filtration; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Transportation; Co-occurrence pattern; Computational savings; Experimental evaluation; Explanatory variables; Measures of association; Minimum support thresholds; Scalable algorithms; Temporal data mining; Exhaust systems (engine); algorithm; data mining; spatiotemporal analysis; tracking; transportation,"Ali, R.Y.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of MinnesotaUnited States; email: alireem@cs.umn.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13846175,,GEOIF,,English,GeoInformatica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011000709

This paper presents a completely unique emotional modeling methodology for incorporating human feeling into intelligent systems. The projected approach includes a technique to elicit emotion factors from users, a replacement illustration of emotions and a framework for predicting and pursuit user’s emotional mechanical phenomenon over time. The neural network based CML service has better training concert and enlarged exactness compare to other large scale deep learning systems. Opinions are important to almost all human activities and cloud based sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment related information from text. With the rising popularity and availability of opinion rich resources such as personal blogs and online appraisal sites, new opportunities and issues arise as people now, actively use information technologies to explore and capture others opinions. In the existing system, a segmentation ranking model is designed to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification. A classification model is used for predicting the sentiment polarity of segmentation. The joint framework is trained directly using the sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without the use of any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. However the existing system still has issue with classification accuracy results. To improve the classification performance, in the proposed system, cloud integrate the support vector machine, naive bayes and neural network algorithms along with joint segmentation approaches has been proposed to classify the very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative features more effectively using important feature selection. Also to handle the outliers we apply modified k-means clustering method on the given dataset. It is used to cloud cluster the outliers and hence the label as well as unlabeled features is handled efficiently.

These concepts and relationships leverage knowledge in the form of ontological structures, which is the backbone of semantic web. This paper proposes a framework that extracts concepts and relationships from unstructured text data and then learns lattices that connect concepts and relationships. The proposed framework uses an off-the-shelf tool for identifying common concepts from a plain text corpus and then implements machine learning algorithms for classifying common relations that connect those concepts. Formal concept analysis is then used for generating concept lattices, which is a proven and principled method of creating formal ontologies that aid machines to learn things. A rigorous and structured experimental evaluation of the proposed method on real-world datasets has been conducted. The results show that the newly proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in concept extraction and lattice generation. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",concept extraction; concept lattices; Formal concept analysis; knowledge discovery; relation extraction,Data mining; Extraction; Information analysis; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ontology; Text processing; Concept extraction; Concept Lattices; Experimental evaluation; Ontological structures; Real-world datasets; Relation extraction; Relationship extraction; State-of-the-art approach; Formal concept analysis,"Anoop, V.S.; Data Engineering Lab, Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala (IIITM-K)India; email: anoop.res15@iiitmk.ac.in",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037640941

Although these data are anonymized by removing personal information, such as user identity, nickname, or address information, personal information still could not be protected effectively. In order to arouse the attention of people from academia and industry for privacy protection, we propose a random forest method to de-anonymize social networks. First, we convert the social network de-anonymization problem into a binary classification problem between node pairs. In order to partition large sparse social networks, we use the spectral partition method to partition large graphs into a number of small subgraphs. Then, we use the features of the network structure to train the random forest classifier. As a result, candidate node pairs from anonymous network and auxiliary network can be classified as matched pair by the random forest classifier. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency of our solution through parallelizing proposed method. The experiments conducted on the real data sets show that our solution's area under the curve is 19% higher than baseline methods on average. Besides that we test the robustness of the proposed algorithm by adding some noisy data, and the result demonstrates that our solution has good robustness. © 2013 IEEE.",De-anonymization; graph partition; network structure; random forest; social network analysis,Data privacy; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Robustness (control systems); Social networking (online); Algorithm design and analysis; Anonymization; Classification algorithm; Graph partition; Network structures; Random forests; Social network services; Data mining,"Hu, G.; School of Computer Science, Shenzhen Institute of Information TechnologyChina; email: hugw@sziit.edu.cn",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030775994

This has been based on the model that delivers services on the internet using the pay-as-you go model that has several advantages like the no up-front cost, a lower IT staff, and a lower operation cost. A technology that is made use of for retrieval of data from huge database is known as text mining. This is used by cloud for efficiently retrieving data from the data centres of cloud. In providing navigation as well as mechanisms for browsing intuitively, text document clustering has an important role. This is done by organizing huge amounts of information into smaller number of clusters. Bag of words (BoW) is a representation that is used for the clustering of these methods but in many case it is not satisfactory as relations that exist between terms that don’t co-occur are ignored. To handle this problem a document level and sentence level integration of the concepts is made. This increases the space of the feature vector and also brings down the clustering algorithm’s efficiency. In order to overcome this a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) based algorithm makes use of the concepts of genetic algorithm (GA) along with grey wolf optimization (GWO) which are considered popular in the SOFM. The goal of the SOFM-GA is to find an optimal topology of network (the number of neurons and their array dimension) along with an optimal training parameter like the scheduling of learning rate and the annealing of neighborhood width. The SOFM-GWO and the GWO-based approach to the formation of SOFM are compared with the SOM standard relating to quality and the weights and map generated. The results of the experiment show that this method achieved better results. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Clustering; Concept based mining; Organizing feature map algorithm (SOFM) and Grey wolf optimization (GWO); Text mining,Classifiers; Conformal mapping; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Information retrieval; Optimization; Self organizing maps; Text processing; Vector spaces; Array dimensions; Clustering; Concept-based; Feature map; Number of clusters; Optimal topologies; Text Document Clustering; Text mining; Clustering algorithms,"Thilagavathy, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sathyabama UniversityIndia; email: thilaga1025@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029572201

DR is widely applied for better data visualization and improving learning in all the above fields. In this manuscript, we propose a novel DR approach namely, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) by developing Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS). Traditional pattern selection methods discriminate boundary and non-boundary patterns with the help of class information and nearest neighbors. And these methods completely ignore noisy patterns which may degrade the performance of subsequent subspace learning. To overcome this, we develop Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS), in which data instances are partitioned into boundary, non-boundary and noisy patterns. With the help of noisy-free boundary and non-boundary patterns, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) has been proposed by developing new within and between-class scatters. These scatters model discriminations between lengths (L2-norms) of different class instances by considering only boundary and non-boundary patterns, while ignoring noisy patterns. A cosine hyperbolic frame work has been developed to formulate the objective of NLDA. Moreover, NLDA can also model the discrimination of multimodal data as different class data may consist of different lengths. Experimental study conducted on the synthesized data, UCI, and leeds butterfly databases. Moreover, an experimental study over human and computer interaction, i.e., face recognition (one of the application areas of expert and intelligent systems), has been performed. And, these studies prove that the proposed method can produce better discriminated subspace compare to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cosine hyperbolic; Dimensionality reduction; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Relevant patterns; Subspace learning,Data mining; Data visualization; Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Human computer interaction; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Between class scatter; Cosine hyperbolic; Dimensionality reduction; Model discrimination; NAtural language processing; Relevant patterns; State-of-the-art methods; Subspace learning; Pattern recognition,"Murthy, K.R.email: k.ramachandra@isical.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016401105

At present, the most common method for discriminating feature selection is based on Global Filter-based Feature Selection Scheme (GFSS). The GFSS assigns a score to each feature based on its discriminating power and selects the top-N features from the feature set, where N is an empirically determined number. As a result, it may be possible that the features of a few classes are discarded either partially or completely. The Improved Global Feature Selection Scheme (IGFSS) solves this issue by selecting an equal number of representative features from all the classes. However, it suffers in dealing with an unbalanced dataset having large number of classes. The distribution of features in these classes are highly variable. In this case, if an equal number of features are chosen from each class, it may exclude some important features from the class containing a higher number of features. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Variable Global Feature Selection Scheme (VGFSS) to select a variable number of features from each class based on the distribution of terms in the classes. It ensures that, a minimum number of terms are selected from each class. The numerical results on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm VGFSS over classical information science methods and IGFSS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Feature selection; Text analysis; Text document classification; Text mining,Data mining; Filtration; Information retrieval systems; Numerical methods; Text processing; Automatic classification; Benchmark datasets; Classical information; Discriminating power; Important features; Text analysis; Text document classifications; Text mining; Feature extraction,"Agnihotri, D.; Department of Computer Applications, National Institute of Technology Raipur, C.G.-492010, India; email: dagnihotri.phd2012.mca@nitrr.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016569326

Based on the sentiments and opinions available, developing a recommendation system is an interesting concept, which includes strategies that combine the small text content with prior knowledge. In this paper, we explore a new application of Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) with deep learning system for sentiment analysis of reviews. The proposed RNN-based Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis (RDSA) recommends the places that are near to the user's current location by analyzing the different reviews and consequently computing the score grounded on it. Deep Learning is used to optimize the recommendations depending on the sentiment analysis performed on the different reviews, which are taken from different social networking sites. The Experiments performed indicate that the RNN based Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis (RDSA) improvises the behavior by increasing the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, which in turn yields better recommendations to the user and thus helps to identify a particular position as per the requirement of the user need. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud; Deep learning; Performance Evaluation; Recursive Neural Networks; Sentiment Analysis,Clouds; Data mining; Deep learning; Electric grounding; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Contextual information; New applications; Performance Evaluation; Prior knowledge; Recursive neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Social networking sites; Text content; Recommender systems,,Nicopolitidis P.Obaidat M.S.Hsiao K.-F.Chen Z.Caballero D.C.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE CITS - Int.

This is usually done by addition of newer hardware, whose configuration might differ from the existing nodes. As a result, clusters are becoming heterogeneous in nature. For many real world machine learning and data mining applications, data is represented in the form of graphs. Most of the existing distributed graph processing frameworks such as Pregel and Graphlab assume that the computational nodes are homogeneous. These frameworks split the graph into approximately equal subgraphs, which is appropriate for homogeneous clusters. In heterogeneous clusters, these frameworks perform poorly in most of the scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, GraphIVE is the only heterogeneity-aware graph processing framework. It learns the relative capabilities of the nodes based on runtime metrics of previous jobs and partitions the graph proportionally. However, it may not perform well if a new job differs drastically in terms of resource requirements when compared to previous jobs executed on the cluster. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphSteal, a dynamic graph re-partitioning policy for vertex-cut based graph processing frameworks on heterogeneous clusters. GraphSteal dynamically re-partitions the graph based on the runtime characteristics of the job. To avoid computational skew in the cluster, it migrates edges from slow nodes to fast nodes. To demonstrate our approach, we modify the source code of Graphlab to incorporate dynamic graph re-partitioning strategy.

Detection of outlier is an active area of research in data mining. If clustering methods are used, the elements that are lying outside the clusters are focused and detected as outliers. But it is not true few unknown elements will become a part of the cluster. So to ignore the irrelevant data completely from the data set, it becomes necessary to identify and eliminate these data merged with the clusters. An efficient hybrid approach is proposed to reduce the number of outliers. Two algorithms namely multilayer neural networks (MLN) and weighted-K means adopted for datamining are employed in proposed approach to identify outliers in a data group. This approach guides and results in better cluster formation. Each element in the dataset provided as input to MLN after assigning weights by weighted K-means. MLN is trained to reproduce the normal input data (inliers) and ensures that groups formed by weighted K-means are consisting of inliers only. Among the outlier detection methods presented in literature for outlier detection in data mining, the proposed method is based on Integrating Semantic Knowledge. This method relates the data point is an outlier by identifying the behaviour of the data elements that differ from other data elements belonging to the same cluster or class. The principle intention of this research work is to reduce the amount of outliers by enhancing the performance of clustering or classification techniques that guides to improve accuracy and reduce the mean square error. The test results provides evident to supremacy of the proposed strategy in reducing the outlier. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Classification; Clustering; Mismatch data; Multilayer neural network,Classification (of information); Data handling; Data mining; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Semantics; Statistics; Classification technique; Cluster formations; Clustering; Clustering methods; Mismatch data; Outlier Detection; Semantic knowledge; Weighted k-means; Data reduction,"Dhanalakshmi, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, RMK Engineering CollegeIndia; email: dhanalakshmiphd@yahoo.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028847576

Network attacks make use of the vulnerability in the network and the protocol to damage the data and application. Cloud follows distributed technology; hence it is vulnerable for intrusions by malicious entities. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) has become a basic component in network protection infrastructure and a necessary method to defend systems from various attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a great problem for a user of computers linked to the Internet. Data mining techniques are widely used in IDS to identify attacks using the network traffic. This paper presents and evaluates a Radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) detector to identify DDoS attacks. Many of the training algorithms for RBF-NNs start with a predetermined structure of the network that is selected either by means of a priori knowledge or depending on prior experience. The resultant network is frequently inadequate or needlessly intricate and a suitable network structure could be configured only by trial and error method. This paper proposes Bat algorithm (BA) to configure RBF-NN automatically. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Bat algorithm (BA); Distributed denial of service (DDoS); Intrusion detection systems (IDS); Neural network (NN); Radial basis function (RBF),Computer crime; Data mining; Denial-of-service attack; Functions; Image segmentation; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Radial basis function networks; Bat algorithms; Distributed denial of service; Intrusion Detection Systems; Neural network (nn); Radial Basis Function(RBF); Network security,"Velliangiri, S.; Department of CSE, Sri Venkatesa Perumal College of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: Velliangiri.s.2009@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028811149

The previous outcomes recommend that the overlapping between classes and the presence of noise have the most grounded impact on the performance of learning algorithm, and software defect datasets are no exceptions. The class overlap problem is concerned with the performance of machine learning classifiers critical problem is class overlap in which data samples appear as valid examples of more than one class which may be responsible for the presence of noise in datasets. We aim to investigate how the presence of overlapped instances in a dataset influences the classifier’s performance, and how to deal with class overlapping problem. To have a close estimate of class overlapping, we have proposed four different measures namely, nearest enemy ratio, subconcept ratio, likelihood ratio and soft margin ratio. We performed our investigations using 327 binary defect classification datasets obtained from 54 software projects, where we first identified overlapped datasets using three data complexity measures proposed in the literature. We also include treatment effort into the prediction process. Subsequently, we used our proposed measures to find overlapped instances in the identified overlapped datasets. Our results indicated that by training a classifier on a training data free from overlapped instances led to an improved classifier performance on the test data containing overlapped instances. The classifiers perform significantly better when the evaluation measure takes the effort into account. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Class overlapping; Data complexity measures; Data mining; Machine learning; Software defect prediction,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Defects; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Class overlapping; Classifier performance; Critical problems; Data complexity; Defect classification; Evaluation measures; Prediction process; Software defect prediction; Classification (of information),"Gupta, S.; Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing JabalpurIndia; email: shivani.panchal@iiitdmj.ac.in",,Springer-Verlag Wien,0010485X,,CMPTA,,English,Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009227462

Soil classification aids farmers in deciding the type of crop to be sown for a particular type of soil. Similarly, wheat variety classification assists in selecting the right type of wheat for a particular product. Current methods used for classifying agricultural data are mostly manual. These methods involve agriculture field visits and surveys and are labor-intensive, expensive, and prone to human error. Recently, data mining techniques such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) have been used in classification of agricultural data such as soil, crops, and land cover. The resulting classification aid the decision making process of government organizations and agro-industries in the field of agriculture. SVM is a popular approach for data classification. A recent study on SVM highlighted the fact that using multiple kernels instead of a single kernel would lead to better performance because of the greater learning and generalization power. In this work, a hybrid kernel based support vector machine (H-SVM) is proposed for classifying multi-class agricultural datasets having continuous attributes. Genetic algorithm (GA) or gradient descent (GD) methods are utilized to select the SVM parameters C and ?. The proposed kernel is called the quadratic-radial-basis-function kernel (QRK) and it combines both quadratic and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The proposed classifier has the ability to classify all kinds of multi-class agricultural datasets with continuous features. Rigorous experiments using the proposed method are performed on standard benchmark and real world agriculture datasets. The results reveal a significant performance improvement over state of the art methods such as NB, k-NN, and SVM in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture; Classification; Hybrid; Kernels; SVM,Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Crops; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Radial basis function networks; Soils; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Continuous attribute; Decision making process; Government organizations; Hybrid; Kernels; Radial basis function kernels; Radial Basis Function(RBF); State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information),"Shastry, K.A.email: adityashastry.k@nmit.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,15684946,,,,English,Appl.

The major source of information is databases. Databases and its technology are having major impact on the highly developing use of computers. To retrieve information from a database, we need to formulate a query in such a way that the computer can understand and produce the necessary output that users required. The SQL norms are been pursued in almost all languages for RDBMS systems. Everybody can not able to write SQL queries that they may not be aware of the structure of database. So there may be a need for users whom were non-expert to query relational databases in their natural language not working with the values of the attributes. This idea of using natural language instead of SQL, has promoted the development for Natural Language Interface to the Database systems. The need of Natural Language Interface to the Database systems is increasing day by day as many more people access information through web browsers, Personal Digital Assistance and cell phones.

But, most of the prior effort in this area is only directed towards prediction of performance in academic results only. Nowadays, education has become employment oriented. Very little attempt is made to predict students' employability. Precise prediction of students' performance in campus placements at an early stage can identify students, who are at the risk of unemployment and proactive actions can be taken to improve their performance. Existing researches on students' employability prediction are either based upon only one type of course or on single University/Institute; thus is not scalable from one context to another. With this necessity, the conception of a unified model of clustering and classification is proposed in this paper. With the notion of unification, data of professional courses namely Engineering and Masters in Computer Applications students are collected from various universities and institutions pan India. Data is large, multivariate, incomplete, heterogeneous and unbalanced in nature. To deal with such a data, a unified predictive model is built by integrating clustering and classification techniques. Two- Level clustering (k-means kernel) with chi-square analysis is applied at the pre-processing stage for the automated selection of relevant attributes and then ensemble vote classification technique with a combination of four classifiers namely k-star, random tree, simple cart and the random forest is applied to predict students' employability. Proposed framework provides a generalized solution for student employability prediction. Comparative results clearly depict model performance over various classification techniques. Also, when the proposed model is applied up to the level of the state, classification accuracy touches 96.78% and 0.937 kappa value. © 2017 MECS.",Classification; Clustering; Data mining; Education; Employability; Prediction,,,,Modern Education and Computer Science Press,2074904X,,,,English,Int.

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure.

Collaborative privacy-preserving data mining based on secured multiparty computation incur high communication and computational cost. Data anonymization is a promising technique in the field of privacy-preserving data mining used to protect the data against identity disclosure. Information loss and common attacks possible on the anonymized data are serious challenges of anonymization. Recently, data anonymization using data mining techniques has showed significant improvement in data utility. Still the existing techniques lack in effective handling of attacks. Hence in this paper, an anonymization algorithm based on clustering and resilient to similarity attack and probabilistic inference attack is proposed. The anonymized data is distributed on Hadoop Distributed File System. The method achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility. In our work the data utility is measured in terms of accuracy and FMeasure with respect to different classifiers.

Trajectory data are obtained using GPS devices that capture the position of an object at specific time intervals. These enormous amounts of data necessitates to explore efficient and effective techniques to extract useful information to solve real world problems. Traffic flow pattern mining is one of the challenging issues for many applications. In a literature significant number of approaches are available to cluster the trajectory data, however the clustering has not been explored for trajectories pattern mining in bi-directional road networks. This paper presents a novel technique for excavating heavy traffic flow patterns in bi-directional road network, i.e. identifying divisions of the roads where the traffic flow is very dense. The proposed technique works in two phases: phase I, finds the clusters of trajectory points based on density of trajectory points; phase II, arranges the clusters in sequence based on spatiotemporal values for each route and directions. These sequences represent the traffic flow patterns. All the routes and sections exceeding a user specified minimum traffic threshold are marked as high dense traffic areas. The experiments are performed on synthetic dataset. The proposed algorithm efficiently and accurately finds the dense traffic in bi-directional roads.

The classification of the images is one of the effective ways to manage and retrieve images. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale multimedia image data classification algorithm based on deep learning. We firstly select the image characteristics to represent the flag for retrieval, which represents the color, texture and shape characteristics respectively. A feature of color is the most basic image data, mainly including the average brightness, color histogram and dominant color, etc. What the texture refers to is the image data in the anomalous, macroscopic as well as orderly one key character that on partial has. The contour feature extraction of image data needs to rely on the edge detection, edge of the detected edge through the connection or grouping to form a meaningful image event. Secondly, we revise the convolutional neural network model based on the pooling operation optimization, the pooling is in the process of the convolution operation to extract the image characteristics of the different locations to gather statistics. Furthermore, we integrate the parallel and could storage strategy to enhance the efficiency of the proposed methodology. The performance of the algorithm is verified, compared with the other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed one obtains the better efficiency and accuracy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image data classification; Information retrieval; Large-scale system; Multimedia architecture,Classification (of information); Color; Convolution; Data mining; Digital storage; Edge detection; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Information retrieval; Large scale systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Search engines; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image characteristics; Image data; Multimedia architecture; Operation optimization; Shape characteristics; State-of-the-art approach; Image texture,"Li, J.; Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: lijuncas@163.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009863270

We observe three milestones in the research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and incorporation of context beyond target text. In this article, we describe datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in sarcasm detection. We also discuss representative performance values, describe shared tasks, and provide pointers to future work, as given in prior works.

This kind of analysis is helpful to explore the potential reasons behind why players leave the game, analyse retention trends, design customised strategies for different player segments, and then boost the overall retention rate. In particular, a new similarity metric which is driven by players' stickiness to the game is developed to cluster players. Three feature dimensions, namely engagement features (e.g., log-in frequency and length of log-in time), performance features (e.g., level, the number of completed tasks, coins and achievements), and social interactions features (e.g., the number of in-game friends, whether or not to join a guild, and the guild role), are employed and aggregated to derive the stickiness metric. The applicability and utility of this new segmentation model are illustrated through experiments that are conducted on a realistic MMORPG dataset. The derived results are also discussed and compared against two benchmark models. The results reveal that the new segmentation model not only achieves better clustering performance, but also improves player's lifetime prediction by better distinguishing between loyal customers and churners. The empirical results confirm the effects of social interaction, which is usually underestimated in the current research, on player segmentation. From an operational perspective, the derived results would help game developers better understand the different retention-behaviour patterns of players, establish effective and customised tactics to retain more players, and boost product revenue. © 2017",Clustering analysis; Game data mining; Online social games; Retention management,Data mining; Image segmentation; Social sciences; Clustering analysis; Feature dimensions; Game data minings; Lifetime prediction; Player segmentation; Segmentation models; Social games; Social interactions; Social networking (online),"Chen, X.; School of Management, Zhejiang UniversityChina; email: chen_xi@zju.edu.cn",,Elsevier B.V.,1679236,,DSSYD,,English,Decis Support Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020419611

Sometimes, existing mining approaches are not sufficient to handle large volume of datasets. Biological data processing also suffers for the same issue. In the present work, a classification process is carried out on large volume of exons and introns from a set of raw data. The proposed work is designed into two parts as pre-processing and mapping-based classification. For pre-processing, three filtering techniques have been used. However, these traditional filtering techniques face difficulties for large datasets due to the long required time during large data processing as well as the large required memory size. In this regard, a mapping-based neural skyline filtering approach is designed. Randomized algorithm performed the mapping for large volume of datasets based on objective function. The objective function determines the randomized size of the datasets according to the homogeneity. Around 200 million DNA base pairs have been used for experimental analysis. Experimental result shows that mapping centric filtering outperforms other filtering techniques during large data processing. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",Bloom filter; mapping centric neural approach; naive approach; neural approach; Neural skyline filtering,Data handling; Filtration; Mapping; Biological data processing; Bloom filters; Classification process; Experimental analysis; naive approach; neural approach; Objective functions; Randomized Algorithms; Data mining,"Ashour, A.S.; Department of Electronics and Electrical, Communications Engineering Tanta UniversityEgypt; email: amirasashour@yahoo.com",,World Scientific Publishing Co.,14690268,,,,English,Int.

Resource Description Framework (RDF), mainly developed for Semantic Web, is presumably a good option when considering graph databases dealing with huge real-world data. RDF models information in the form of triples <subject, predicate, object>, and is considered as a useful tool to store graph data (aka linked data) where each edge can be stored as a triple. Due to existence of huge amount of linked data, mostly in the form of graphs, graph mining has been successful in attracting researchers from different research €elds for efficient handling (storage, indexing, retrieval, etc.) of graph data. As a result, various APIs like GraphX and GraphFrames are developed to facilitate relational queries over graph data. Though GraphX is older than GraphFrames and processing SPARQL queries over GraphX has been explored by some researchers, to the best of our knowledge, SPARQL query processing over GraphFrames has not been explored yet. In this paper, we present an initial study on query-specific search space pruning and query optimization approach to process SPARQL queries over GraphFrames in an efficient manner,e experimental results, in terms of low response time for query execution, are encouraging, and give way to invest more research efforts in this direction. © 2017 ACM.",Graph mining; Graphframes; GraphX; Linked data mining; SPARQL query processing,Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Query languages; Query processing; Semantic Web; Data management system; Graph mining; Graphframes; GraphX; Linked datum; Query optimization approaches; Resource description framework; Search space pruning; Information management,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE/WIC/ACM Int.

Many authors have presented different versions of the churn prediction models greatly based on the data mining concepts employing the machine learning and meta-heuristic algorithms. This aim of this paper is to study some of the most important churn prediction techniques developed over the recent years. The primary objective is on the churn in telecom industries to accurately estimate the customer survival and customer hazard functions to gain the complete knowledge of churn over the customer tenure. Another objective is the identification of the customers who are at the blink of churn and approximating the time they will churn. This paper focuses on analyzing the churn prediction techniques to identify the churn behavior and validate the reasons for customer churn. This paper summarizes the churn prediction techniques in order to have a deeper understanding of the customer churn and it shows that most accurate churn prediction is given by the hybrid models rather than single algorithms so that telecom industries become aware of the needs of high risk customers and enhance their services to overturn the churn decision. © 2017 IEEE.,churn prediction; data mining; hybrid models; telecom industry,Data mining; Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Learning systems; Churn predictions; Customer churn prediction; Customer retention; Hybrid model; Meta heuristic algorithm; Primary objective; Telecom industry; Telecommunications industry; Sales,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The placement prediction is more complex when the complexity of educational entities increase. Educational institutes look for more efficient technology that assist better management and support decision making procedures or assist them to set new strategies. One of the effective ways to address the challenges for improving the quality is to provide new knowledge related to the educational processes and entities to the managerial system. With the machine learning techniques the knowledge can be extracted from operational and historical data that resides within the educational organization's databases using. The dataset for system implementation contains information about past data of students. These data are used for training the model for rule identification and for testing the model for classification. This paper presents a recommendation system that predicts the students to have one of the five placement statuses, viz., Dream Company, Core Company, Mass Recruiters, Not Eligible and Not Interested in Placements. This model helps the placement cell within an organization to identify the prospective students and pay attention to and improve their technical as well as interpersonal skills. Furthermore, the students in pre-final and final years of their B. Tech course can also use this system to know their individual placement status that they are most likely to achieve.

Recommendation of products to attract customers that meet their requirements is very important for the vendors to survive in the global market. The approach proposed in this paper is novel and serves as a better alternative to rate a product based on its technical specification by analyzing large number of user reviews which are extracted dynamically from several top e-commerce websites. This avoids the need, for the user, to search for opinions and comments online before making a purchase. The proposed approach in this study extracts specification list like battery, processor, camera etc. and customer reviews for a user specified product from different websites and identifies crucial terms corresponding to the technical features of the product in the review to determine polarity of the feature and classifying it under the specification list. Each specification is assigned a score based on polarity i.e. positive/negative feedback. Overall product rate is calculated by aggregating the score specific to individual features. This approach is very useful for those customers who target at specific features in a product. © 2017 IEEE.",Feature extraction; Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Recommendations; Sentiment analysis,Data mining; Feature extraction; International trade; Sales; Specifications; Websites; E-commerce websites; Individual features; Opinion mining; Product recommendation; Recommendations; Sentiment analysis; Technical features; Technical specifications; Natural language processing systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This paper presents a PCA-based dictionary building for sparse recognition. Recursive least square based auto-associative neural network model has been used for principal component extraction. Suggested network structure supports data compression along with principal component extraction. The trained principal components are used as the atoms of the dictionary. Proposed approach performs the recognition task at a low dimension space, hence involves less computation. In the recognition phase, a given image is sparsely represented as a linear combination of neuronal weights, which corresponds to underlying principal components.

Traditionally for storing, retrieving and experimenting test data, researchers start with mysql database which is more approachable and easier to build their test experimentation platform. These test bed mysql databases will store data in the form of rows and columns, over which various SQL queries are performed. At times when the structure and size of dataset changed, these traditional mysql databases become inefficient in storing and retrieving of data. When the structure of dataset changes from row-column to graph representation, mysql database based querying and analysis become inefficient. The internal representation of data is changed to key-value pairs, more often the data in an unstructured format, which prompted the researchers to think about other databases which can achieve faster retrieval and mining over the dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for feature selection using the search capability of particle swarm optimization. The compact feature set used for training the classifier yields much better results when compared to the baseline model, which was developed with a complete set of features. A large number of features suitable for named entity recognition task from biomedical domain are also developed in the current paper. The complete set of features is implemented by studying the properties of datasets and from the domain knowledge.

Preferential attachment and link copying models, while enabling elegant analysis, only capture rich-gets-richer effects, not aging and decline. Recent aging models are complex and heavily parameterized; most involve estimating 1-3 parameters per node. These parameters are intrinsic: they explain decline in terms of events in the past of the same node, and do not explain, using the network, where the linking attention might go instead. We argue that traditional characterization of linking dynamics are insufficient to judge the faithfulness of models. We propose a new temporal sketch of an evolving graph, and introduce several new characterizations of a network's temporal dynamics. Then we propose a new family of frugal aging models with no per-node parameters and only two global parameters. Our model is based on a surprising inversion or undoing of triangle completion, where an old node relays a citation to a younger follower in its immediate vicinity. Despite very few parameters, the new family of models shows remarkably better fit with real data. Before concluding, we analyze temporal signatures for various research communities yielding further insights into their comparative dynamics. To facilitate reproducible research, we shall soon make all the codes and the processed dataset available in the public domain. © 2017 ACM.",Aging models; Network growth models; Relay-link,Data mining; Dynamics; Obsolescence; Aging models; Evolving networks; Network growth models; Preferential attachments; Relay links; Reproducible research; Research communities; Temporal signatures; Complex networks,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,Proc.

Earth science data are complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional data, and the sparsity of data in high-dimensional space poses major challenge in clustering of the data. Shared nearest neighbor clustering (SNN) algorithm is one of the well-known and efficient methods to handle high-dimensional spatiotemporal data. The SNN clustering method does not cluster all the data forming rigid boundary selection. This paper reports fuzzy shared nearest neighbor (FSNN) algorithm which is an enhancement of the SNN clustering method that has the capability of handling the data lying in the boundary regions by means of a fuzzy concept. The clusters obtained can be characterized by the cluster centroid, which summarizes the behavior of the ocean points in the cluster. The statistical measure is used to find the significant relation between the cluster centroids and the existing climate indices. In this study, correlation measure is used to find the significant pattern, such as teleconnection or dipole. The experimentation is performed on Indian continent latitude range (Formula presented.) and longitude range (Formula presented.). Extensive experiments are carried out to compare the proposed approach with existing clustering methods such as K-means, fuzzy C-means and SNN. The proposed method, FSNN algorithm, not only handles the data lying in the overlapping region, but it also finds more compact and well-separated clusters. FSNN shows better results in terms of finding a significant correlation between cluster centroids and existing climate indices and validated by ground truth dataset. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany",Climate indices; Clustering; Earth science data; Fuzzy shared nearest neighbor; Shared nearest neighbor,Cluster analysis; Data handling; Data mining; Earth (planet); Earth sciences; Climate index; Clustering; Correlation measures; Earth science data; High dimensional data; High dimensional spaces; Shared nearest neighbors; Statistical measures; Clustering algorithms,"Sharma, R.; Department of Computer Applications, National Institute of Technology RaipurIndia; email: rikasharma678@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027311254

This helps in finding out interesting patterns, trends and relationships within data. Association rule mining and bi-clustering are two very important data mining tasks for many application domains, especially in bio-informatics. FIST is one of the very few algorithms which extracts bases of association rules and bi-clustering conjointly in a single process. FIST algorithm is based on frequent closed itemsets framework and uses a suffix tree based data structure for efficiency. However, due to its sequential execution approach, the traditional FIST algorithm suffers from efficiency problems in terms of execution time for very large data sets with high dimensionality. Here, a parallelized version of FIST algorithm is proposed to improve the performance. In the new parallelize version of FIST algorithm (ParaFIST), a multi-Threaded approach is taken to allow parallel processing of the suffix tree branches to achieve better execution time.

As few years back, data mining was essential and vital to any sphere, so is the now the spectrum of privacy preserving data mining expanding with a thrust upon its applicability and efficacy. PPDM is a pool of solutions which takes care of shielding of data which has personal or private information and where any level of percolation of such information can be a cause of colossal and irreversible loss to an individual or business. At the same time, PPDM is also concerned with not compromising on the utility of other data which would be participating in mining. A balance between both the aspects: the secrecy and accuracy requires a smart balancing solution. Any algorithm suggested vary in several measures like efficiency, accuracy, data transfer costs, level of secrecy maintained, speed: to name a few. No algorithm is such that it can be generalized to perform superior to the rest. They are situation, domain and requirement specific. In this paper, an algorithm with a background framework for PPDM is proposed which anonymizes sensitive horizontal partitioned style distributed data, before they partake in collective mining process. Efforts have been made to conceal maximum personal information and not allowing it to affect on the results of mining. It is also kept in mind that the data transfer remains minimal during the entire process without distressing the quality of final findings. The experimental results and analysis is also presented for a detailed evaluation of the proposed method.

The paper proposes a parallel B-Tree index in the MapReduce framework for improving efficiency of random reads over the existing approaches. The benefit of using the MapReduce framework is that it encapsulates the complexity of implementing parallelism and fault tolerance from users and presents these in a user friendly way. The proposed index reduces the number of data accesses for range queries and thus improves efficiency. The B-Tree index on MapReduce is implemented in a chained-MapReduce process that reduces intermediate data access time between successive map and reduce functions, and improves efficiency. Finally, five performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of proposed index for range search query in MapReduce, such as, varying cluster size and, size of range search query coverage on execution time, the number of map tasks and size of Input/Output (I/O) data. The effect of varying Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) block size and, analysis of the size of heap memory and intermediate data generated during map and reduce functions also shows the superiority of the proposed index. It is observed through experimental results that the parallel B-Tree index along with a chained-MapReduce environment performs better than default non-indexed dataset of the Hadoop and B-Tree like Global Index (Zhao et al., 2012) in MapReduce. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",B-Tree; Cluster; Distributed computing; Hadoop; HDFS; MapReduce,Big data; Cluster computing; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Efficiency; Fault tolerance; File organization; Trees (mathematics); B trees; Cluster; Hadoop; HDFS; Map-reduce; Data reduction,"Singh, H.email: harirawat@rediffmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,0167739X,,FGCSE,,English,Future Gener Comput Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016927640

The MapReduce framework provides the distributed environment to run the Apriori on big transactional data. However, MapReduce is not suitable for iterative process and declines the performance. We introduce a novel algorithm named Hybrid Frequent Itemset Mining (HFIM), which utilizes the vertical layout of dataset to solve the problem of scanning the dataset in each iteration. Vertical dataset carries information to find support of each itemsets. Moreover, we also include some enhancements to reduce number of candidate itemsets.

SAMOA stands for scalable advanced massive online analysis, is a machine learning framework used to perform distributed data mining over streaming data. Vertical Hoeffding Tree (VHT) under SAMOA is a variant of very fast decision tree used for distributed classification of data streams. The performance of VHT depends on various critical parameters such as tie-threshold, grace value, confidence, split criterion, etc. Although, VHT is widely accepted as an efficient streaming classifier but one of the challenges in streaming classification is varying distribution of incoming data instances with respect to underlying classes in different datasets; therefore performance of VHT varies in different datasets. Therefore, achieving optimal performance from the stream classifier like VHT on different datasets is a challenging task and fixed set of values of critical parameters cannot be preconfigured for various types of datasets. This research work explores the capabilities of VHT streaming classifier of SAMOA in the light of various benchmarking performance statistics such as classification accuracy, kappa and kappa temporal. The work presented here, experimentally identifies suitable values of critical parameters of VHT that yield optimized performance on different datasets.

The patterns of interactions of suspicious users are quite different from their peers and can be identified by using anomaly detection techniques. The existing anomaly detection techniques on social networks focus on networks with only one type of interaction among the users. However, human interactions are inherently multiplex in nature with multiple types of relationships existing among the users, leading to the formation of multilayer social networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection on multilayer social networks by combining the rich information available in multiple network layers. We propose a pioneer approach namely ADOMS (Anomaly Detection On Multilayer Social networks), an unsupervised, parameter-free, and network feature-based methodology, that automatically detects anomalous users in a multilayer social network and rank them according to their anomalousness. We consider the two well-known anomalous patterns of clique/near-clique and star/near-star anomalies in social networks, and users are ranked according to the degree of similarity of their neighborhoods in different layers to stars or cliques. Experimental results on several real-world multilayer network datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively detect anomalous nodes in multilayer social networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Graph mining; Multi-graphs; Online social networks; Outlier detection; Social network analysis,Data mining; Multilayers; Social networking (online); Stars; Anomaly detection; Graph mining; Multi-graphs; On-line social networks; Outlier Detection; Network layers; experimental model; human; mining; neighborhood; social network,"Bindu, P.V.email: bindupv007@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,7475632,,CHBEE,,English,Comput.

These data are liable to missing values since there are situations, where the patient observations are neither done regularly nor updated correctly. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to impute missing values in an unevenly spaced clinical time-series data by proposing a tolerance rough set induced bio-statistical (TRiBS) framework. The proposed framework adopts an inverse distance weight (IDW) interpolation technique and improves it using the concept of tolerance rough set (TR) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). METHOD: To interpolate an unknown data point, the classical IDW interpolation suffers from two major drawbacks: first, in selecting the known data points and second, choosing an optimal influence factor. TRiBS framework overcomes the first limitation using TR and the second using PSO. TR derives the dependent attributes for each attribute using non-missing records. The nearest significant set is then generated for each missing value based on its attribute dependencies. The PSO technique fixes the weights for the data in a nearest significant set by finding an optimized influence factor. The obtained significant set and its influence factor are used in IDW computations to impute missing value. RESULT: The proposed work is experimented using clinical time series dataset of hepatitis and thrombosis patients. However, the proposed system can support other clinical time series dataset with minor domain specific changes. CONCLUSION: The performance of the imputed results proves the effectiveness of TRiBS. Experimental evaluation with the classifiers such as neural networks, support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree have shown an improvement in the classification accuracy when a missing data is pre-processed with the proposed framework. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Inverse distance weight; Missing value; Particle swarm optimization; Time series; Tolerance rough set,Autocorrelation; Data mining; Decision trees; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Network function virtualization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Rough set theory; Support vector machines; Time series; Trees (mathematics); Classification accuracy; Clinical time series; Experimental evaluation; Interpolation techniques; Inverse distance weight; Missing values; Temporal classification; Tolerance rough sets; Classification (of information),"Khanna, N.H.; Ramanujan Computing Centre, Anna UniversityIndia; email: nehemiah@annauniv.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,1679473,,CSDAD,,English,Comput.

One of such data analysis task in dynamic environment is to design an incremental classifier for decision making and consequently updating the knowledge base of the overall system. Classifier construction depicts extraction of interesting patterns from the large repository of data and predicts the future trends based on the existing patterns. The time complexity of the classification system increases gradually and the system becomes inefficient while it is learned repeatedly for adding new group of data with the existing one in a certain interval of time. Without learning the same classifier for the whole data, if the knowledge of old data extracted by the classifier is used together with the new group of data to design the updated classifier, called incremental classifier, then time complexity reduces drastically. In the paper, the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization technique and Association Rule Mining are used to design an incremental rule based classification system. The incremental classifier is suitable to apply on rice disease dataset for disease prediction as the characteristics of rice diseases change in time due to change of climate, biological, and geographical factors. The proposed method has been applied on both simulated rice disease dataset and benchmark datasets and the classification accuracy is measured and compared with various state of the art classification algorithms. The method is also evaluated based on some statistical measures and statistical test is done to establish its significance and effectiveness. © 2017",Data mining; Dynamic classifier; Incremental data; Particle Swarm Optimization; Rice disease,Climate change; Data handling; Data mining; Education; Evolutionary algorithms; Information analysis; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification system; Dynamic classifiers; Incremental data; Particle swarm optimization technique; Rule-based classification system; Statistical measures; Classification (of information); complexity; data mining; data set; decision making; design; disease; equipment; optimization; prediction; rice,"Sengupta, S.; Department of Information Technology, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, India; email: shampa2512@yahoo.co.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1681699,,CEAGE,,English,Comput.

We have fused Electroencephalogram (EEG) waves of user and corresponding global textual comments of the video to understand the user's preference more precisely. In our framework, the users were asked to watch the video-advertisement and simultaneously EEG signals were recorded. Valence scores were obtained using self-report for each video. A higher valence corresponds to intrinsic attractiveness of the user. Furthermore, the multimedia data that comprised of the comments posted by global viewers, were retrieved and processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for sentiment analysis. Textual contents from review comments were analyzed to obtain a score to understand sentiment nature of the video. A regression technique based on Random forest was used to predict the rating of an advertisement using EEG data. Finally, EEG based rating is combined with NLP-based sentiment score to improve the overall prediction. The study was carried out using 15 video clips of advertisements available online. Twenty five participants were involved in our study to analyze our proposed system. The results are encouraging and these suggest that the proposed multimodal approach can achieve lower RMSE in rating prediction as compared to the prediction using only EEG data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",EEG signal analysis; Multimedia indexing and retrieval; Multimodal rating; Predictive modeling; Sentiment analysis,"Data mining; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Rating; EEG signals; Multi-modal; Multimedia indexing and retrieval; Predictive modeling; Sentiment analysis; Modal analysis; Article; conceptual framework; controlled study; decision tree; electroencephalography; human; human experiment; information processing; linear regression analysis; natural language processing; normal human; prediction; priority journal; random forest; regression analysis; sentiment analysis; signal processing; advertising; biological model; brain; consumer attitude; electroencephalography; Internet; physiology; procedures; Advertising as Topic; Brain; Consumer Behavior; Electroencephalography; Humans; Internet; Models, Neurological; Natural Language Processing","Gauba, H.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: gauba.himanshu@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,8936080,,NNETE,28254237,English,Neural Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013777747

Several reliable prognostic models based on survival analysis procedures have been useful to a variety of domains, with different degree of success. An enhanced model with further advancement of computerized medical decision support systems help clinicians and doctors in building strategies for understanding surgical outcomes. A tenfold cross validation (CV) was applied in the medical input dataset which was obtained from United Network Organ Sharing database. In order to perform the dimensionality reduction of a huge database, principal component analysis (PCA) with ranking was done. The relation between attributes was recognized and proved using various association rule mining techniques, such as apriori, tertius, and treap algorithms. For confirming the results, we compared the rules generated by the association rules mining algorithm before and after PCA was also performed. We proposed an effective and accurate artificial neural network (ANN) model for the prediction of long-term survival of liver patients who undergo liver transplantation (LT). A tenfold CV was applied in the medical input dataset which was obtained from United Network Organ Sharing database. We made survival analysis of 13 years in the prediction of liver patients after LT. We trained the liver follow up data of 13 years separately using multilayer perceptron ANN model with proper selection of data attributes. Our model outperformed the existing models in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. From the comparison of existing approaches, our model promised high accuracy in survival analysis after LT. We have also evaluated the survival probabilities of 13 years of follow up liver data and proved that our prediction model is suitable for long-term prognosis of survival of patients after LT. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial neural network (ANN); liver transplantation (LT); survival prediction; survival probability,Artificial intelligence; Association rules; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Database systems; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Multilayers; Neural networks; Artificial neural network models; Association rules mining; Dimensionality reduction; Liver transplantation; Medical decision support system; Multi-layer perceptron networks; Survival prediction; Survival probabilities; Principal component analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21682216,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

In particular, bioscience and medical datasets routinely contain several thousands of features. For effective data mining in such databases, many methods and techniques have been developed. Rough set is a mathematical theory for dealing with uncertainty. In dominance-based rough set extension of rough set, the set of objects partitioned into pre-defined and preference-ordered classes, the new rough set approach is able to approximate this partition by means of dominance relations. This paper suggests improved dominance-based rough set for classification of medical data. Dominance-based rough set can handle ordinal attribute. This paper proposed a technique for applying dominance-based rough set for nominal attribute. This proposed work suggests decision table to determine dominance relation, and then improved dominance-based rough set is applied to find lower, upper, boundary approximations in the entire dataset. Then attribute reduction based on proposed technique is applied to find the essential attribute required for classification. This proposed method can accurately classify medical datasets collected from UCI repository Web sites. This proposed method works in seven different datasets: They are heart disease dataset, Pima Indian diabetes dataset, Breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, heart valve dataset, jaundice datasets, dermatology dataset and lung cancer dataset.

Adoption of pain medications and safe healthcare practices is a major global policy concern. This adoption process is highly influenced by the interpersonal network of physicians prescribing medications to treat pain. However, existing research into physician networks have been hospital-specific, applied to a smaller number of physicians, and dependent upon physicians’ self-reports. In this paper, using big-data and data-mining, we overcome these limitations: By using a case of 30+ hospitals spanning across 2000+ physicians, we create a social network containing physicians’ prescription data and adoption behavior of pain medications. The social network assumes that connected physicians work in the same hospital and belong to the same specialty or specialty group. Then, using the centrality measures, degree and eigenvector centrality, we analyze prescription volumes and proportion of adopters of pain medications. We also analyze gender effects. Results revealed that the most influential physicians were not the high-volume prescribers. Male physicians were more influential compared to female physicians; however, females prescribed more volume compared to males. O ur results help us identify critical physicians from certain core specialties and specialty groups who may be approached by patients seeking pain relief. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Eigenvector centrality; Gender; Pain medications; Social network analysis,Data mining; Diseases; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Health; Hospitals; Social networking (online); Adoption behavior; Adoption process; Centrality measures; Eigenvector centralities; Gender; Global policies; National academies; Pain medications; Big data,,Diesner J.Ferrari E.Xu G.,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In reality, the passenger seeking strategies are mostly empirical and substantially vary among taxi drivers. From the history taxi data, the top performing taxi drivers can earn 25% more than the ones with mediocre seeking strategy in the same period of time. A better strategy not only helps taxi drivers earn more with less effort, but also reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. It is interesting to examine the influential factors in passenger seeking strategies and find algorithms to guide taxi drivers to passenger hotspots with the right timing. With the abundant availability of history taxicab traces, the existing methods of doing taxi business have been radically changed. This paper focuses on the problem of mining efficient operation strategies from a large-scale history taxi traces collected over one year. Our approach presents generic insights into the dynamics of taxicab services with the objective of maximizing the profit margins for the concerned parties. We propose important metrics, such as trip frequency, hot spots, and taxi mileage, and provide valuable insights toward more efficient operation strategies.

This paper comprises the development of a framework based on associative classification techniques on heart dataset for early diagnosis of heart based diseases. It is hard to diagnose the heart diseases with just observation that arrives suddenly and may prove fatal when it's uncontrolled. The implementation of work is done on Cleveland heart diseases dataset from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository to test on different data mining techniques. The various attributes related to cause of heart diseases are viz: gender, age, chest pain type, blood pressure, blood sugar etc that can predict early symptoms heart disease. Various data mining algorithms such as Aprior, FP-Growth, Naive bayes, ZeroR, OneR, J48 and k-nearest neighbor are applied in this study for prediction of heart diseases.

The literature presents different spatial data mining methods to mine knowledge from spatial databases. In this paper, spatial association rules are mined to automatic grouping of spatial data objects using a candidate generation process with three constraint measures, such as support, confidence, and lift. Then, the proposed multiple kernel-based probabilistic clustering is applied to the associate vector to further group the spatial data objects. Here, membership probability based on probabilistic distance is used with multiple kernels, where exponential and tangential kernel functions are utilized. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed with three data sets of three different geometry types using the number of rules and clustering accuracy. From the experimentation, the results proved that the proposed multi-kernel probabilistic clustering algorithm achieved better accuracy as compared with the existing probabilistic clustering. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",association rule mining; clustering; kernel; probabilistic clustering; Spatial database,Association rules; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Data mining; Database systems; Geographic information systems; Maps; Query languages; clustering; Environmental assessment; kernel; Membership probability; Probabilistic clustering; Probabilistic distance; Spatial association rules; Spatial database; Clustering algorithms,"Jayababu, Y.; Department of CSE, Pragati Engineering CollegeIndia; email: jayababuy2015@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023195890

The posts of the users of the social media are used by many companies in the world to find the mentality of the users, the current trend of the market and many more things. But still, there is a latent potential in the social network. One of the aspect that we were able to discover was about finding the relationship between the users (i.e., especially, the negative link) on the social network using the posts that the users make and the reaction of the other users towards it. The prediction of the negative link can be applied in the cyber security field, to observe the aberrations in the network and further find the malicious nodes in the social network; say, if two nodes are doing things together even though there is no relation between them. It can also be used in improving the recommendation system in social media as if there is some probability between the two nodes of being the enemy or disliking each other then we can remove them from each other's recommendation list or could assign a lower weight to them in our recommendation algorithm. To achieve all this relationship between the nodes we first need to find whether the user is posting posts with positive emotion (like happy, excited, etc.) or negative emotion (like angry, sad, etc.) so that we can further analyze the mentality of the user and use it to recommend the people who we have previously classified with the similar personality. For that, we have used the sentiment analysis, which divides the users into five simple categories: Extremely +ve(i.e.,positive), +ve, Neutral, -ve (i.e.,negative) and Extremely -ve. This research paper explains the methodologies that we have used to achieve the prediction of negative links between the nodes in the social network. © 2017 IEEE.",Negative Link Prediction; Sentiment Analysis; Social Networks,Behavioral research; Data mining; Forecasting; Mobile computing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cyber security; Disruptive innovations; Link prediction; Malicious nodes; Positive emotions; Recommendation algorithms; Research papers; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Clustering is used to find existent similar patterns in graphs and thus help in getting useful insights. In real-world, nodes may belong to more than one cluster thus, it is essential to analyze fuzzy cluster membership of nodes. Traditional centralized fuzzy clustering algorithms incur high communication cost and produce poor quality of clusters when used for large graphs. Thus, scalable solutions are obligatory to handle huge amount of data in less computational time with minimum disk access. In this paper, we proposed a parallel fuzzy clustering algorithm named ‘PGFC’ for handling scalable graph data. It will be advantageous from the viewpoint of expert systems to develop a clustering algorithm that can assure scalability along with better quality of clusters for handling large graphs.The algorithm is parallelized using bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) based Pregel model. The cluster centers are initialized using degree centrality measure, resulting in lesser number of iterations. The performance of PGFC is compared with other state of art clustering algorithms using synthetic graphs and real world networks. The experimental results reveal that the proposed PGFC scales up linearly to handle large graphs and produces better quality of clusters when compared to other graph clustering counterparts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Big data mining; Clustering; Fuzzy C-Mean; Graphs; Pregel,Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Expert systems; Fuzzy clustering; Graphic methods; Bulk synchronous parallel; Cluster memberships; Clustering; Fuzzy C mean; Graphs; Number of iterations; Pregel; Real-world networks; Clustering algorithms,"Rani, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: raggarwal@thapar.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013170867

These data are liable to complexities such as missing data, observations at irregular time intervals and large attribute set. Due to these complexities, mining in clinical time-series data, remains a challenging area of research. This paper proposes a bio-statistical mining framework, named statistical tolerance rough set induced decision tree (STRiD), which handles these complexities and builds an effective classification model. The constructed model is used in developing a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to assist the physician in clinical diagnosis. The STRiD framework provides the following functionalities namely temporal pre-processing, attribute selection and classification. In temporal pre-processing, an enhanced fuzzy-inference based double exponential smoothing method is presented to impute the missing values and to derive the temporal patterns for each attribute. In attribute selection, relevant attributes are selected using the tolerance rough set. A classification model is constructed with the selected attributes using temporal pattern induced decision tree classifier. For experimentation, this work uses clinical time series datasets of hepatitis and thrombosis patients. The constructed classification model has proven the effectiveness of the proposed framework with a classification accuracy of 91.5% for hepatitis and 90.65% for thrombosis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Clinical time series; Data mining; Decision tree; Double exponential smoothing; Fuzzy; Tolerance rough set,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Fuzzy inference; Medical information systems; Rough set theory; Time series; Classification accuracy; Clinical decision support systems; Clinical time series; Decision tree classifiers; Double exponential; Double exponential smoothing methods; Fuzzy; Tolerance rough sets; Trees (mathematics),"Khanna, N.H.; Ramanujan Computing Centre, Anna UniversityIndia; email: nehemiah@annauniv.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013269705

Businesses and leading industries are viewing these huge data repositories as a tool to design future strategies, prediction models by analyzing patterns and gaining knowledge from this unstructured data by applying different data mining techniques. Medical domain has now become richer in term of maintaining digital records of patients related to their diagnosis and treatment. These huge data repositories can range from patient personnel data, diagnosis, treatment histories, test diagnosis, images and various scans. This terabytes of medical data is quantity rich but weaker in information in terms of knowledge and robust tools to identify hidden patterns of knowledge specifically in medical sector. Data Mining as a field of research has already well proven capabilities of identifying hidden patterns, analysis and knowledge applied on different research domains, now gaining popularity day by day among researchers and scientist towards generating novel and deep insights of these large biomedical datasets also. Uncovering new biomedical and healthcare related knowledge in order to support clinical decision making, is another dimension of data mining. Through massive literature survey, it is found that early disease prediction is the most demanded area of research in health care sector. As health care domain is bit wider domain and having different disease characteristics, different techniques have their own prediction efficiencies, which can be enhanced and changed in order to get into most optimize way. In this research work, authors have comprehensively compared different data classification techniques and their prediction accuracy for chronic kidney disease. Authors have compared J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM and k-NN classifiers using performance measures like ROC, kappa statistics, RMSE and MAE using WEKA tool.

An entire industry of black-market services has emerged which offers fake accounts based services for sale. We, therefore, in our work, focus on detecting fake accounts on a very popular (and difficult for data collection) online social network, Facebook. Key contributions of our work are as follows. The first contribution has been collection of data related to real and fake accounts on Facebook. Due to strict privacy settings and ever evolving API of Facebook with each version adding more restrictions, collecting user accounts data became a major challenge. Our second contribution is the use of user-feed information on Facebook to understand user profile activity and identifying an extensive set of 17 features which play a key role in discriminating fake users on Facebook with real users. Third contribution is the use these features and identifying the key machine learning based classifiers who perform well in detection task out of a total of 12 classifiers employed. Fourth contribution is the identifying which type of activities (like, comment, tagging, sharing, etc) contribute the most in fake user detection. Results exhibit classification accuracy of 79% among the best performing classifiers. In terms of activities, likes and comments contribute well towards detection task. Although the accuracy is not very high, however, our work forms a baseline for further improvement. Our results indicate that many fake users are classified as real suggesting clearly that fake accounts are mimicking real user behavior to evade detection mechanisms.

Mostly Data mining algorithms find the interesting patterns of data from the value-based database where the information is exact. It is not so easy to discover interesting patterns from big data. To abstain from squandering a ton of space & time in searching down frequent item uncertain big data, proposed approach permits clients to show their enthusiasm for terms of succinct anti-monotone constraint. MapReduce technique is used to mine frequent patterns. Two sets of map and reduce functions are used by proposed system to mine valid singleton and non-singleton patterns. In proposed work, UF-Tree algorithm generates tree structure of dataset and UF-growth mines frequent itemsets recursively. To further reduce the search space and execution time in uncertain big data, proposed work gives importance to the frequency of items using weighting factors, and calculate expected support of item on the basis of weight. It reduces the nodes in the first level of tree, which leads to a reduction in the size of the tree and execution time. © 2017 IEEE.",Big Data; Constraints; Expected Support; MapReduce; UF-Tree,Data mining; Forestry; Trees (mathematics); Anti-monotone constraints; Constraints; Data mining algorithm; Existential probability; Internet application; Map-reduce; UF-Tree; Weighting factors; Big data,,PadmaSai Y.Garg D.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

These costs put tremendous strain on budgets and are contributing to the current wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. It is essential for companies to control their EDA tool costs which form majority of the R&D cost and keep their processes smarter now than ever. Traditional EDA cost optimization efforts have concentrated only on license server and compute farm information stored in databases, without the design information generated by the tool. To enable smarter cost-saving/planning/management decisions, it is no more suffice to analyze the license usage information alone in a silo; there has to be holistic understanding of the user-tool-license-compute ecosystem to have a significant impact. In this paper we discuss our approach to efficiently gather and store design process data of EDA tools using Big Data technologies along with examples of specific analysis methods and visualizations for mining insights from such data-store.

It gives the output in the form of a sentiment score of each of the word and the overall text along with orientation of both (keywords and text) as being positive/ neutral/ negative. Social media has become a new platform for discussions in recent years due to growth in its reach. Sentiment analysis has proved to be quite useful in determining the collective response of people on any issue by analysing their opinions which are generally in the form of written texts. However, human beings do not understand numbers but language. So, we use the mathematical technique of perceptual computing to provide a mapping between numeric and linguistic data to generate recommendations. It is based on Zadeh's computing with words (CWW). However, to generate recommendations from perceptual computing, we need problem specific linguistic terms and their associated interval values. Obtaining interval values may not be possible in scenarios where the number of subjects available for providing feedback is very less. So, here we propose a new approach that processes the linguistic information using perceptual computing based on the intervals extracted using the sentiment score using a sentiment analysis tool. © 2017 IEEE.",Interval type 2 fuzzy sets; Interval type1 fuzzy sets; membership function; Perceptual computing; Sentiment analysis,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Learning systems; Linguistics; Membership functions; Soft computing; Computing with word (CWW); Computing with words; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Linguistic information; Machine learning techniques; Perceptual computing; Sentiment analysis; Type-1 fuzzy sets; Natural language processing systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This is done to resolve the issue of selection of hyper parameters in SVM. The selection of hyper parameters in SVM plays a crucial rule which is done by the PSO-SSO approach. This approach has two phases: In first phase best initial parameters of SVM are calculated using SSO with ELS approach and then the best parameters are fed into SVM using PSO in second phase.

There has been a drastic increase in recent years, pushing fraud detection more important than ever. Hundreds of millions of dollars are lost to fraud every year. Upcoding fraud is one such fraud in which a service provider acquires additional financial gain by coding a service by upgrading it even though the lesser service has been performed. Incorporating artificial intelligence with data mining and statistics help to anticipate and detect these frauds and minimize costs. Using sophisticated data mining tools, millions of transcations can be searched to spot patterns and detect fraudulent transactions. This paper gives an insight into the various datamining tools which are efficient in detecting upcoding frauds especially in the healthcare insurance sector in India. © 2017 IEEE.",DataMining; Fraud Detection; Healthcare; Upcoding,Crime; Health care; Laws and legislation; Data-mining tools; Financial gains; Financial sectors; Fraud detection; Fraudulent transactions; Government agencies; Service provider; Upcoding; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Many times an analyst may end up with an erroneous classifier because of huge, redundant, unreliable and noisy data. It may also be due to misinterpretation of results and usage of inappropriate techniques for a specific situation. In our study, we have investigated the two main approaches in data mining which are Decision Tree (J48 algorithm) and Ensemble Learning Technique (AdaBoost). We have also performed a comparative analysis of these two techniques. The tool which we have used is WEKA which is an open source's software. The datasets which we have used are supermarket.arff, labor.arff, soybean.arff, & segment.arff. Here. arff is an abbreviation of Attribute Relation file Format which is the standard format that is accepted by WEKA for the datasets. The sample size of training set is number of attributes and number of instances available in the dataset. Classification models are assessed on the basis of number of class labels in the dataset, accuracy, amount and length of the generated rules, error rate and standard deviation. Based on number of experiments which we have performed, results show that AdaBoost provides better accuracy than Decision Tree (J48 algorithm) when the number of class labels in the dataset are exactly two whereas the Decision Tree generate rules faster than the Adaboost and when number of class labels in the dataset are more than two then J48 algorithm performs better than Adaboost. The results show the tradeoff of using the two approaches for other researchers in finding the best model for a particular problem. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Decision Tree,Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Open source software; Open systems; Trees (mathematics); Classification models; Comparative analysis; Ensemble learning; Machine learning techniques; Number of class; Standard deviation; Standard format; Training sets; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"India Int.

The techniques like anonymization, randomization are used to achieve the goal. But unfortunately anonymization leads to certain level of information loss while preserving privacy. Due to drift of data over the centralized server has added to the more demand of preserving privacy to dominate the trust of individuals. The application like the data of online shopping customers, patients, insurance is stored online over the centralized repository these days and it needs to maintain privacy of the individuals. In all the quoted applications the data contains many fields like email address, zip code, age, nationality etc. The quasi-identifiers like zip code, age, gender of a person does not seem to be very important to protect but these fields when linked with some other attributes can expose the identity or sensitive information of an individual. Thus the quasi-identifiers need a special scrutinity in the purpose of achieving privacy. The proposed hybrid approach combining suppression and perturbation for Privacy Preserving data mining takes care of these requirements. The method focuses on the goal of preserving privacy by suppressing and perturbing the quasi identifiers in the data of online shopping customers stored on centralized data repository without causing any loss to the information in the process. The method targets to overcome the limitation of information loss while preserving privacy. The experiment is carried by setting up a local server on the system and the simulation results are compared with anonymization to show that the goal to achieve privacy of quasi identifiers without information loss is successfully achieved. © 2017 IEEE.",Anonymization; Perturbation; Privacy Preserving Data mining; Quasi-identifiers; Suppression,Data mining; Electronic commerce; Perturbation techniques; Anonymization; Perturbation; Privacy preserving data mining; Quasi identifiers; Suppression; Data privacy,"Kaur, A.; Computer Science Department, PEC University of TechnologyIndia; email: arshveer1992@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Ontologies are a formal way of representing conceptual knowledge and can be related to text data to assist in this task. There is always a need for accurate interpretation of medical records of cancer patients in deciding intervention plans for proper treatment. However due to the ever changing demand in healthcare services such information sources can be highly variable and may not be suitable for all patients. In this situation the most challenging problem is personalizing healthcare treatment adapted to the patient's medical, social and economic conditions. To manage this problem efficiently the work suggests an ontology alignment model using context aware properties of the system and the patient to facilitate decision making. A patient ontology is mapped to the disease ontology to dynamically transform general treatment options into individual intervention plans most suitable for the patient. The proposed method can be used by medical professionals in recognizing incorrect diagnosis, preventive actions or in identifying co-occurring diseases in the patient. © 2016 IEEE.",Cancer treatment; Context awareness; Ontology alignment; Personalization,Data mining; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Oncology; Ontology; Conceptual knowledge; Context- awareness; Healthcare services; Information exchanges; Information sources; Medical professionals; Ontology alignment; Personalizations; Patient treatment,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"India Int.

Agricultural meteorology is the science that applies knowledge in weather data relating to atmospheric environment observed by instruments on the ground and by remote sensing. Most of the data need to be processed for generating various decisions such as cropping and scheduling of irrigation. This paper describes a data mining study of agricultural meteorological patterns collected from meteorological centre of Bengaluru district. We use K Means and Hierarchical clustering techniques to extract patterns like minimum (15 to 17°C) and maximum (28 to 29°C) air temperature, relative humidity (79 to 96%) in the interim of morning hours and (42 to 50%) in the interim of noon hours, rainfall (0 mm) and pan evaporation (5.22 to 7.2 mm) which gives great significance to predict probable result. The obtained results play a crucial role in the decision making for sustainable agriculture. Along with this we also compared these algorithms by applying Connectivity, Silhouette width and Dunn index formula which measures internal validation of clustering techniques.

This has led to study and research in this area. We have used data mining to analyze the existing trends in air pollution in Delhi and make prediction about the future. The data mining techniques used are linear regression and multilayer perceptron. We have seen the trends of various air pollutants like sulphur dioxide(SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3). By using the above techniques we have observed that there will be an increase in amount of PM10 by 45.9% in coming years. However amount of CO and NO2 may show slight increase due to increasing number of 2 wheelers on road. The other pollutants like SO2 may show decrease due to usage of non sulphur fuel and stringent pollution control measures. © 2016 IEEE.",Air Pollution; Linear Regression; Multilayer Perceptron,Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Data mining; Linear regression; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Pollution control; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutants; Nitrogen dioxides; Particulate Matter; Air pollution,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"India Int.

To solve this problem, Personalization is considered as a popular solution to customize the World Wide Web environment toward the user's preferences. Recent study shows that Web Usage Mining techniques play an important role in designing Web page recommendation systems. However the present conventional content-based recommender systems, built using the Web Usage Mining process, do not take Semantic Knowledge into pattern discovery and recommendation process. Recent studies show that integrating domain knowledge in the form of ontology into Web Usage Mining process can enhance the quality of the discovered usage patterns. Our work aims to incorporate semantics knowledge in all the phases of Web Usage mining process. CloSpan, a state-of-the-art algorithm for Sequential Pattern mining is applied over the Semantic space to generate frequent Sequential Patterns.

People buy online products frequently and post their reviews about the products they have used. The viewpoint of the user will be in the form of tweets or product reviews which they post in an e-commerce site. These reviews will have significant role in deciding how far the products have been placed in peoples mind. These reviews will also help the manufacturers to improve the features of the product as required But it is a very difficult task to manually read the reviews and assign sentiment to them. This problem can be solved by creating an automated system in which we can analyze the reviews posted by the users and extract the users perception about a particular feature.

User behaviour analysis in different domains based on web logs has its utility for enterprises to have strategic decision making. Business growth of enterprises depends on customer-centric approaches that need to know the knowledge of customer behaviour to succeed. The rationale behind this is that customers have alternatives and there is intense competition. Therefore business community needs business intelligence to have expert decisions besides focusing customer relationship management. Many researchers contributed towards this end. However, the need for a comprehensive framework that caters to the needs of businesses to ascertain real needs of web users. This paper presents a framework named eXtensible Web Usage Mining Framework (XWUMF) for discovering actionable knowledge from web log data. The framework employs a hybrid approach that exploits fuzzy clustering methods and methods for user behaviour analysis. Moreover the framework is extensible as it can accommodate new algorithms for fuzzy clustering and user behaviour analysis. We proposed an algorithm known as Sequential Web Usage Miner (SWUM) for efficient mining of web usage patterns from different datasets. We built a prototype application to validate our framework. Our empirical results revealed that the framework helps in discovering actionable knowledge. © 2017 IEEE.",Business intelligence; Fuzzy clustering; Knowledge discovery; Web usage mining,Blogs; Clustering algorithms; Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Decision making; Fuzzy clustering; Information analysis; Management science; Network function virtualization; Public relations; Sales; Websites; Business community; Customer behaviour; Customer relationship management; Fuzzy clustering method; Strategic decision making; Web 2.0 applications; Web usage mining; Web usage patterns; Behavioral research,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

It can also be said that economic fraud is drastically increasing in the global communication improvement. It is being recorded every year that the loss due to these fraudulent acts is billions of dollars. These activities are carried out so elegantly so it is similar to genuine transactions. Hence simple pattern related techniques and other less complex methods are really not going to work. Having an efficient method of fraud detection has become a need for all banks in order to minimize chaos and bring order in place. There are several techniques like Machine learning, Genetic Programming, fuzzy logic, sequence alignment, etc are used for detecting credit card fraudulent transactions. Along with these techniques, KNN algorithm and outlier detection methods are implemented to optimize the best solution for the fraud detection problem. These approaches are proved to minimize the false alarm rates and increase the fraud detection rate.

The users will be eagerly using these data for the future purpose and get information about the opinions of others thus there is a need of automatic summarization of opinion of the web users. Opinion Mining is a process of extracting and analyzing people's opinion regarding the given object and Sentiment Analysis explains about the hidden sentiments in the opinions. A most important challenge in this is to identify the sentiments and aspects and then perform the data classification based on these features and this process is called aspect based feature extraction. Opinion summarization can be done using machine learning such as maximum entropy, naive bayes, Support vector machine (SVM) model and, Random forest technique. The data sources to be taken for the proposed method are from customer review of product.

Twitter is one of such social medias used by many users about some topics in the form of tweets. These tweets can be analyzed to find the viewpoints and sentiments of the users by using clustering-based methods. However, due to the subjective nature of the Twitter datasets, metaheuristic-based clustering methods outperforms the traditional methods for sentiment analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel metaheuristic method (CSK) which is based on K-means and cuckoo search. The proposed method has been used to find the optimum cluster-heads from the sentimental contents of Twitter dataset. The efficacy of proposed method has been tested on different Twitter datasets and compared with particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, cuckoo search, improved cuckoo search, gauss-based cuckoo search, and two n-grams methods. Experimental results and statistical analysis validate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. The proposed method has theoretical implications for the future research to analyze the data generated through social networks/medias. This method has also very generalized practical implications for designing a system that can provide conclusive reviews on any social issues. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cuckoo search; Data preprocessing; K-means; Sentiment analysis; Twitter,Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Social networking (online); Cuckoo searches; Data preprocessing; K-means; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Optimization,"Chandra Pandey, A.email: avish.nsit@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,3064573,,IPMAD,,English,Inf.

Common classifiers when trained by imbalanced data tend to bias towards the class possessing bulk instances causing misclassification of upcoming patterns/instances. The study reveals that presence of redundant borderline instances and outliers in the data-space severely catalyzes the effect of class imbalance. The Condensed Nearest Neighbor and Tomek-link undersampling techniques are used as the baseline systems for the present study, and an improved undersampling algorithm is proposed to be employed in the pre-processing stage by amalgamating aspects of outlier and redundancy detection to the baseline system. The proposed scheme imparts to detect outlier, redundant and noisy instances having least contribution in estimating accurate class labels. Thus, a data-level solution has been offered to the concerned problem with novelty in effective elimination of majority instances without losing valuable information. The proposed scheme is implemented and validated with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), K-Nearest-Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers for 10 real-life datasets.

In order to overcome this problem, we have proposed an idea to use Apriori algorithm to find the most frequently asked requirements which in turn helps in reducing the stakeholder conflict.

Motivated by its success, we propose Tree-based localized fuzzy twin support vector clustering (Tree-TWSVC). Tree-TWSVC is a novel clustering algorithm that builds the cluster model as a binary tree, where each node comprises of proposed TWSVM-based classifier, termed as localized fuzzy TWSVM (LF-TWSVM). The proposed clustering algorithm Tree-TWSVC has efficient learning time, achieved due to the tree structure and the formulation that leads to solving a series of systems of linear equations. Tree-TWSVC delivers good clustering accuracy because of the square loss function and it uses nearest neighbour graph based initialization method. The proposed algorithm restricts the cluster hyperplane from extending indefinitely by using cluster prototype, which further improves its accuracy. It can efficiently handle large datasets and outperforms other TWSVM-based clustering methods. In this work, we propose two implementations of Tree-TWSVC: Binary Tree-TWSVC and One-against-all Tree-TWSVC. To prove the efficacy of the proposed method, experiments are performed on a number of benchmark UCI datasets.

The growing need to extract knowledge from big data streams has pioneered the challenge of selecting appropriate cloud resources. The current techniques allocate resources based on data characteristics. But because of the stochastic nature of data generation, the characteristics of data in big data streams are unknown. This poses difficulty in selecting and allocating appropriate resources to big data stream. Working towards this direction, this paper proposes a system that predicts the data characteristics in terms of volume, velocity, variety, variability, and veracity. The predicted values are expressed in a quadruple called Characteristics of Big data (CoBa). Thereafter, the proposed system uses self-organizing maps to dynamically create clusters of cloud resources. One of these clusters is allocated to the big data stream based on its CoBa. The proposed system is dynamic in the sense that it changes the cloud cluster allocated to big data stream if its CoBa changes. Experimental results show that the proposed system has a performance edge over other streaming data processing tools such as Storm, Flume, and S4.

This was overcome by application of fuzzy set for solving different real life problems. Intuitionistic fuzzy set was introduced to handle complex circumstances and to provide better result. Fuzzy set proves its efficiency in field data processing. Minimal structure fuzzy oscillation can be efficiently applied for image processing, especially for face recognition. In this paper we introduce the concept of Intuitionistic fuzzy set or IF Set based minimal structure oscillation. A face database which may be considered as training set, is used to form IF set minimal structure. Again non membership pixel values are also calculated with those pixel values which are used to form IF set minimal structure accordingly. The pixels from membership and nonmembership images are applied to compute two new oscillatory operators. We introduce four new conditions according to the values of the oscillatory operators, which is used for recognition of the face. This new concept can be applied in different types of real life data analysis such as data mining. Along with the theoretical explanation we also presented some experimental results which proves the precision of the face recognition algorithm.

Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources.

The malware use many anti-detection techniques to mutate. Thus no virus scanner can claim complete malware detection even for known malware. Static and dynamic analysis techniques focus upon different kinds of malware such as Evasive or Metamorphic malware. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach that combines static checking and dynamic analysis for malware detection. Static analysis is used to check the specific code characteristics. Dynamic analysis is used to analyze the runtime behavior of malware. The authors propose a framework for the automated analysis of an executable's behavior using text mining. Text mining of dynamic attributes identifies the important features for classifying the executable as benign and malware. The synergistic combination proposed in this paper allows detection of not only known variants of malware but even the obfuscated, packed and unknown malware variants and malware evasive to dynamic analysis.

Sequences are attributed temporal characteristics either explicitly or implicitly. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a subset of artificial neural networks (ANNs) which have appeared as a powerful, principle approach to learn dynamic temporal behaviors in an arbitrary length of large-scale sequence data. Furthermore, stacked recurrent neural networks (S-RNNs) have the potential to learn complex temporal behaviors quickly, including sparse representations. To leverage this, the authors model network traffic as a time series, particularly transmission control protocol / internet protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predefined time range with a supervised learning method, using millions of known good and bad network connections. To find out the best architecture, the authors complete a comprehensive review of various RNN architectures with its network parameters and network structures. Ideally, as a test bed, they use the existing benchmark Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency / Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (DARPA) / (KDD) Cup ‘99’ intrusion detection (ID) contest data set to show the efficacy of these various RNN architectures. All the experiments of deep learning architectures are run up to 1000 epochs with a learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5] on a GPU-enabled TensorFlow and experiments of traditional machine learning algorithms are done using Scikit-learn. Experiments of families of RNN architecture achieved a low false positive rate in comparison to the traditional machine learning classifiers. The primary reason is that RNN architectures are able to store information for long-term dependencies over time-lags and to adjust with successive connection sequence information. In addition, the effectiveness of RNN architectures are shown for the UNSW-NB15 data set.

The objective of the current study is to present how cancer registry data could be processed using data mining techniques in order to improve the statistical analysis outcomes. Methods Data were collected from the Cancer Registry of Crete in Greece (counties of Rethymno and Lasithi) for the period 1998–2004. Data collection was performed on paper forms and manually transcribed to a single data file, thus introducing errors and noise (e.g. missing and erroneous values, duplicate entries etc.). Data were pre-processed and prepared for analysis using data mining tools and algorithms. Feature selection was applied to evaluate the contribution of each collected feature in predicting patients’ survival. Several classifiers were trained and evaluated for their ability to predict survival of patients. Finally, statistical analysis of cancer morbidity and mortality rates in the two regions was performed in order to validate the initial findings. Results Several critical points in the process of data collection, preprocessing and analysis of cancer data were derived from the results, while a road-map for future population data studies was developed. In addition, increased morbidity rates were observed in the counties of Crete (Age Standardized Morbidity/Incidence Rates ASIR = 396.45 ± 2.89 and 274.77 ± 2.48 for men and women, respectively) compared to European and world averages (ASIR= 281.6 and 207.3 for men and women in Europe and 203.8 and 165.1 in world level). Significant variation in cancer types between sexes and age groups (the ratio between deaths and reported cases for young patients, less than 34 years old, is at 0.055 when the respective ratio for patients over 75 years old is 0.366) was also observed. Conclusions This study introduced a methodology for preprocessing and analyzing cancer data, using a combination of data mining techniques that could be a useful tool for other researchers and further enhancement of the cancer registries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer data; Crete; Data mining; Feature selection; Greece,Data acquisition; Data mining; Diseases; Feature extraction; Statistical methods; Cancer data; Cancer registries; Continuous monitoring; Crete; Data analysis methods; Data-mining tools; Greece; Long term planning; Population statistics; adult; aged; cancer epidemiology; cancer registry; classifier; controlled study; data analysis; data mining; DNA transcription; error; female; Greece; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality rate; noise; overall survival; participant observation; scientist; statistical analysis; adolescent; algorithm; epidemiology; Greece; incidence; middle aged; morbidity; mortality; neoplasm; prospective study; register; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Data Mining; Female; Greece; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Registries; Young Adult,"Varlamis, I.; Department of Informatics and Telematics, Harokopio University of AthensGreece; email: varlamis@hua.gr",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1692607,,CMPBE,28552128,English,Comput.

Since the Risk value very much influences the further course of the treatment, the correctness of the risk value is eminent. So the novelty of the proposed method lies in considering many classification algorithms and many diagnostics data sets to predict the risk value. Moreover in the proposed method we have given flowchart for finding the risk value, which is a novelty. The results shows that the selection of classification algorithms cannot be universal as proposed by many recent researches and each type of data set will be having a certain type of classifier which works best for the data set. The proposed system has four classifiers namely Mixed cardio data classifier, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography(SPECT) data classifier, Electrocardiogram(ECG) data classifier and 1-year survival Electrocardiogram data classifier, each trained with benchmark datasets of University of California, Irvine(UCI) Machine learning repository. The performance of algorithms such as Iterative Dichotomiser3(ID3), Naïve Bayes(NB), Support Vector Machine(SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN) and Ensemble classifiers such as Bagging and Boosting are evaluated for every data set and best classifier is chosen by its accuracy measure. Ensemble method is the most efficient for 1-year survival ECG data classifier with 89.5% accuracy, ID3 is the most efficient algorithm for Mixed cardiac data classifier with 96.9% accuracy and SVM is the most efficient algorithm for SPECT data classifier and ECG data Classifier with accuracy of 98.3% and 100% respectively.

This paper presents an analysis using data mining techniques for estimating the future yield prediction in tea cultivation with climatic change trends observed in last 30 years (1977-2006). The patterns of crop production in response to the climatic (rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, evaporation and sunshine) effect across the four tea growing regions (South Bank, North Bank, Upper Assam and Cachar) of Assam were developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) technique. The tea production estimation equations developed for the regions were validated for the future yield prediction (2007, 2009 and 2010) and were found to be significant.

It is an unsupervised learning technique for exploring the structure of the data without class label. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed to analyze high volume of data, but very few of them evaluate the quality of the clusters due to irrelevant and inconsistent features present in the dataset. So, feature selection is an important pre-processing step in data analysis mainly for high dimensional dataset. In the paper, we select optimal subset of features and perform clusters analysis simultaneously using genetic algorithm. Basically, genetic algorithm is used to select the optimal subset of features which automatically finds optimal number of clusters sat the end of the process. Optimality of the clusters is measured by calculating various cluster validation indices. The overall performance of the method is investigated on popular UCI datasets and the experimental results are compared with Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.",Cluster analysis; Cluster validation index; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm,Cluster analysis; Copying; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Fuzzy clustering; Genetic algorithms; Quality control; Class labels; Cluster validation; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; High-dimensional dataset; Optimal number; Optimal subsets; Pre-processing step; Uci datasets; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

This has been recognized in the research community and multiple solutions based on supervised learning approach have been proposed in the recent literature. However, these approaches need significant amount of labeled training data for use in real-life projects. In this paper, we propose to use Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) to carry out concept-based classification of software defect reports. We compute the 'semantic similarity' between the defect type labels and the defect report in a concept space spanned by Wikipedia articles and then, assign the defect type which has the highest similarity with the defect report. This approach helps us to circumvent the problem of dependence on labeled training data. Experimental results show that using concept-based classification is a promising approach for software defect classification to avoid the expensive process of creating labeled training data and yet get accuracy comparable to the traditional supervised learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of Wikipedia and ESA for software defect classification problem. © 2017 IEEE.",Explicit Semantic Analysis; Mining Software Respositories; Software Defect Classification; Text Data Mining,Automation; Classification (of information); Data mining; Life cycle; Semantics; Supervised learning; Text processing; Automatic identification; Explicit semantic analysis; Labeled training data; Mining software; Research communities; Software defects; Supervised learning approaches; Text data mining; Defects,"Patil, S.; Dept. of Computer Science and Engg, IIT MadrasIndia; email: sangameshwar.patil@tcs.com",,IEEE Computer Society,21601852,9.78154E+12,,,English,IEEE Int.

Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, Twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on Twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from Twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from Twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets. © 2016 IEEE.",N-gram; Word2vec,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Embedded systems; Finance; Forecasting; Investments; Signal processing; Social networking (online); Dow Jones Industrial averages; N-grams; Sentiment analysis; Stock market prediction; Strong correlation; Supervised machine learning; Textual representation; Word2vec; Financial markets,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is a tried and tested fact that at least 70% of the communication that we engage in is nonverbal in nature. It is from this fact that the sciences of Micro-expression reading, body language analysis etc originated. A similar pattern is observed in the the linguistics of the choice of words of a person and his handwriting. Graphology (Handwriting Analysis) and Statement Analysis can also be a tool to gain an insight in to the psyche of the person. For example if a person uses the word never as a substitute for no in a yes or no there is a high probability of a suspicion of deception in the context. Similar techniques are used by experts of Neuro Linguistic programming worldwide for a variety of applications. They are used to interrogate criminals and hasten the process of investigation. They can act as human lie detectors. From a written statement they can highlight the possible statement that need cross-verification as they can spot graphological and statement analysis markers in them. But such people are few in number and it takes years and years of training to be at that skill level. Hence a software (Matlab application) is then programmed to replicate this behaviour. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Handwriting; Neural Network; Sentiment Analysis; Sentiment Analysis,Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Data mining; Embedded systems; Linguistics; Neural networks; Signal processing; Body language; Handwriting; Handwriting analysis; High probability; Matlab applications; Micro-expressions; Sentiment analysis; Similar pattern; MATLAB,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Transfer of money from one account holder to another has become possible in seconds because of advanced technologies in information processing. Not only this in all sectors like railways, insurance, health sector, fashion technology, education sector, sales and business sectors, and advertisement sectors every firm digitized its operations. One such sector is banking where every individual based on his or her financial status will be considered for crediting loan, and credit card etc. If the credit score of the loan availing person is high banks will be ready to provide him with the loan but the availing person can opt for any one of the banks on his or her own willing. Such scenario happens in credit card churn prediction also. Hence the banks should take healthy measures to retain the existing credit card holders without any churn. Withholding existing customers of a firm plays an important role to increase the overall revenue of the firm and retains the good name of the firm in competitive market. Hence every organization takes key measures to withhold existing customers using customer management models. Because customer retention is a crucial task as it reduces the time, money and workforce needed for adding new customers to the firm. Customers retention technique in credit card churn prediction (C3P) was done using only supervised classification techniques. But it could not end with better results. So, through many proven hybrid classification techniques we can bring better accuracy in C3P. Also C3P lags in highly efficient techniques like rough set theory. Hence in this work initially we perform data processing techniques and in second stage we propose modified rough K-means algorithm used for clustering credit card holders and in next stage hold-out method divides the cluster data into testing and training clusters. At last classification is performed using various algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and Naive Bayes.

Data mining plays an important role in building an intelligent model for medical systems to detect heart disease (HD) using data sets of the patients, which involves risk factor associated with heart disease. Medical practitioners can help the patients by predicting the heart disease before occurring. The large data available from medical diagnosis is analyzed by using data mining tools and useful information known as knowledge is extracted. Mining is a method of exploring massive sets of data to take out patterns which are hidden and previously unknown relationships and knowledge detection to help the better understanding of medical data to prevent heart disease. There are many DM techniques available namely Classification techniques involving Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision tree (DT), Neural network (NN), Genetic algorithm (GA), Artificial intelligence (AI) and Clustering algorithms like K-NN, and Support vector machine (SVM). Several studies have been carried out for developing prediction model using individual technique and also by combining two or more techniques.

Generation of rule involves two phases where first phase finds the frequent itemsets and second phase generates the rule. Many algorithms are specified to find frequent item set from the sequential patterns. There are mainly two approaches for finding frequent item sets. First approach is with candidate sequence generation i.e. Apriori approach and second with the pattern growth method. Experiments shows that if the length of sequence is small, pattern growth method performs better than that of Apriori approach. In this paper we have analyzed the pattern growth method for the dataset of engineering student. With finding associations among the attributes we can find the chances of taking admission and predict the admission decisions of students. To find strong and valid association rules, different measures like min Interest, lift, leverage and conviction are considered.

By applying analytics to the structured and unstructured data the enterprises brings a great change in their way of planning and decision making. Sentiment analysis (or) opinion mining plays a significant role in our daily decision making process. These decisions may range from purchasing a product such as mobile phone to reviewing the movie to making investments - all the decisions will have a huge impact on the daily life. Sentiment Analysis is dealing with various issues such as Polarity Shift, accuracy related issues, Binary Classification problem and Data sparsity problem. However various methods were introduced for performing sentiment analysis, still that are not efficient in extracting the sentiment features from the given content of text. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Maximum Entropy are the machine learning algorithms used for sentiment analysis which has only a limited sentiment classification category ranging between positive and negative. Especially supervised and unsupervised algorithms have only limited accuracy in handling polarity shift and binary classification problem. Even though the advancement in sentiment Analysis technique there are various issues still to be noticed and make the analysis not accurately and efficiently. So this paper presents the survey on various sentiment Analysis methodologies and approaches in detailed. This will be helpful to earn clear knowledge about sentiment analysis methodologies. At last the comparison is made between various paper's approach and issues addressed along with the metrics used. © 2017 IEEE.",Data Analytics; Decision making; sentiment Analysis,Bins; Data mining; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Surveys; Binary classification problems; Business decisions; Data analytics; Data sparsity problems; Decision making process; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Unsupervised algorithms; Maximum entropy methods,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Data mining finds its application in various fields like finance, retail, medicine, agriculture etc. Data mining in agriculture is used for analyzing the various biotic and abiotic factors. Agriculture in India plays a predominant role in economy and employment. The common problem existing among the Indian farmers are they don't choose the right crop based on their soil requirements. Due to this they face a serious setback in productivity. This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters. This reduces the wrong choice on a crop and increase in productivity. In this paper, this problem is solved by proposing a recommendation system through an ensemble model with majority voting technique using Random tree, CHAID, K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes as learners to recommend a crop for the site specific parameters with high accuracy and efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.",CHAID; Ensemble model; K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes; Majority Voting technique; Precision agriculture; Random tree; Recommendation system,Agriculture; Classifiers; Crops; Data mining; Nearest neighbor search; Productivity; Rayon yarn; Soils; CHAID; Ensemble modeling; Naive bayes; Precision Agriculture; Random tree; Voting techniques; Recommender systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Sometimes due to almost illegible handwriting, it is difficult to understand the medication reports of doctors. This often confuses the patients about the actual medicine/disease names written by doctors and as a consequence they suffer. A medical prescription is generally partitioned into two parts, a printed letterhead part containing the doctor's name, designation, organization name, etc. and a handwritten part where the doctor writes patient's name and report his/her findings and suggests medicine names. There are many significance impacts of the proposed work. For example, such work can be used (i) to develop expert diagnostic systems (ii) to extract information from patient history that can be obtained by this proposed method (iii) to detect wrong medication (iv) to make different statistical analysis of the medicines prescribed by the doctors etc. To extract the information from such document images, first we extract the domain specific knowledge of doctors by identifying department names from the printed text that appears in letterhead part. From the letterhead text, the specialty/expertise of doctors is understood and this helps us to search only relevant prescription documents for word spotting in handwritten portion. Word spotting in letterhead part as well as in handwritten part has been performed using Hidden Markov Model. An efficient MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) based Tandem feature is proposed to improve the performance. From the experiment with 500 prescriptions, we have obtained encouraging results. Information from printed letterhead part improved the word spotting performance in handwritten part, significantly. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Hidden Markov model; Knowledge extraction; Medical prescriptions; Printed/handwritten text separation; Word spotting,Data mining; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Domain-specific knowledge; Extract informations; Information retrieval approach; Knowledge extraction; Medical prescription; MLP (multilayer perceptron); Text separations; Word Spotting; Diagnosis,"Roy, P.P.; Department of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology RoorkeeIndia; email: proy.fcs@iitr.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011883187

Existing methods primarily target standard (ST) mutation mentions (e.g.'E6V'), leaving relevant mentions natural language (NL) largely untapped (e.g.'glutamic acid was substituted by valine at residue 6'). Results: We introduced three new corpora suggesting named-entity recognition (NER) to be more challenging than anticipated: 28-77% of all articles contained mentions only available in NL. Our new method nala captured NL and ST by combining conditional random fields with word embedding features learned unsupervised from the entire PubMed. In our hands, nala substantially outperformed the state-of-the-art. For instance, we compared all unique mentions in new discoveries correctly detected by any of three methods (SETH, tmVar, or nala). Neither SETH nor tmVar discovered anything missed by nala, while nala uniquely tagged 33% mentions. For NL mentions the corresponding value shot up to 100% nala-only.

We are no longer constrained by our own opinion. Others' opinions and sentiments play a huge role in shaping our perspective. In this paper, we build on previous works on Twitter sentiment analysis using Distant Supervision. The existing approach requires huge computation resource for analyzing large number of tweets. In this paper, we propose techniques to speed up the computation process for sentiment analysis. We use tweet subjectivity to select the right training samples. We also introduce the concept of EFWS (Effective Word Score) of a tweet that is derived from polarity scores of frequently used words, which is an additional heuristic that can be used to speed up the sentiment classification with standard machine learning algorithms. We performed our experiments using 1.6 million tweets. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed technique is more efficient and has higher accuracy compared to previously proposed methods. We achieve overall accuracies of around 80% (EFWS heuristic gives an accuracy around 85%) on a training dataset of 100K tweets, which is half the size of the dataset used for the baseline model. The accuracy of our proposed model is 2-3% higher than the baseline model, and the model effectively trains at twice the speed of the baseline model. © 2017 IEEE.",,Data mining; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Social networking (online); Computation process; Computation resources; Experimental evaluation; Micro-blogging services; Overall accuracies; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Standard machines; Natural language processing systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The method leverages different techniques of machine learning to analyze the text. Machine translation is used in the system to provide with the feature of dealing with different languages. After the machine translation, text is processed for finding the sentiments in the text. With the advent of blogs, forums and online reviews there is substantial text present on internet that can be used to analyze the sentiment about a particular subject or an object. Hence to reduce the processing it is beneficial to extract the important text present in it.

With this reckless augmentation in information material, there comes a daunting task in organizing the information according to people's demands. The plight is like 'drowning in data but starving for knowledge'. So to avoid the challenging scenario we have techniques to extract or filter information which have great relevance to user's query.

This results in opinion mining being one of the core areas of affective computing. Classification of opinions or sentiments is the core task in opinion mining. To accomplish this task, often Bag-Of-Words(BOW) is used as a feature for training a classifier in statistical machine learning. However, the fundamental limitations in handling the polarity shift problem in turn limits the performance of BOW in some cases. Also the external dictionaries used for generating training sets for opinion classification are not domain specific. This further limits the task of deriving the accurate sentiment or consumer opinion in certain cases. We address these two problems in opinion classification. To handle the problem of polarity shift, we propose a Dual Opinion mining Model. The data expansion technique used in this model creates a review which has opposite opinion as that of the original test review for each training and test review. Based on this we propose a dual training algorithm which uses the pairs of the original and the reversed review to learn an opinion classifier. A dual prediction algorithm is used for classification of test reviews by considering both positive and negative sides of each review. At the end we build a pseudo-opposites dictionary using a corpus based method. By this we tackle the problem of having to depend upon an external opposites dictionary for opposites of reviews. By doing this we also get a domain adaptive dictionary for training a classifier which increases the accuracy of the dual opinion mining model. © 2016 IEEE.",Natural language processing; Opinion classification; Opinion mining; Polarity shift problem,Data mining; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Affective Computing; Corpus-based methods; Fundamental limitations; Opinion mining; Polarity shift problem; Prediction algorithms; Statistical machine learning; Training algorithms; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Due to exploration of different types of vulnerabilities, day by day threat of attacks in network is increasing. There is possibility of getting system infected by internal or external intruders. Single computer system is shared by multiple users. Users use multiuser system by creating their own account, which is protected by unique id and password. Sometimes, authorized users attack system for some malicious purposes. Internal attacks include deleting some important files or data, altering some important data. For any intrusion detection system, it is very difficult to identify authorized internal intruders. SQL injection is one such attack, which can be launched by internal attacker. The purpose of external intruder is to perform malicious activities in remote system. To avoid these two types of attacks, the robust intrusion detection system is needed. In this paper, we have implemented hybrid intrusion detection system, which includes identification of both internal and external attacks. Signature matching algorithm is implemented to identify internal attacks. Fuzzy genetic algorithm is applied for implementation of external attacks detection. The system is hybrid and compatible in offline as well as online environment. Experimental results show that the accuracy of system is better than some of existing systems. © 2016 IEEE.",Data Mining; Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm; Insider attack; Intrusion Detection System; SQL injection,Computer crime; Cryptography; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Mercury (metal); Fuzzy - genetic algorithms; Hybrid intrusion detection; Insider attack; Internet-based communication; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious activities; Online environments; SQL injection; Intrusion detection,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

DoS attack targets to make the service out of resources, so that it becomes unavailable to the legitimate users. Due to unpredictable behaviour of hacker it is difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious network traffic. Moreover, as defence against these improve, attacks also evolve. New kind of unknown attacks continue to strike and it is not easy to detect them based on information of pre-existing attacks.

As businesses look to understand and exploit these variegated means of online expression, it has become necessary to automate the process of detecting the panorama of underlying themes. A challenging task is to detect the gradual transitions of context that occur within a text. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach for analyzing textual content that conveys multiple themes. It focuses on efficiently segregating the context switches in text, and then accurately mining the different opinions present. We utilize three categories of features namely positional, lexical-semantic and sentiment polarity for theme co-referent text segmentation within a document. We obtain a Beta Cubed F1 score of 0.7208 for theme co-referent text segmentation of fifty text documents obtained from the question-Answer website Quora. The topics corresponding to the theme of each of these segments are obtained by using a noun phrase extractor. We further present an application of the proposed approach to improve the efficiency of Sentiment Analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the proficiency of the proposed scheme to segregate textual content by themes, identify meaningful topics inherent in the themes, compute the polarity, and also suggest the applicability of the method to query-based retrieval systems. © 2016 IEEE.",,Semantics; Gradual transition; Innovative approaches; Lexical semantics; Noun phrase extractors; Retrieval systems; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Text segmentation; Data mining,,Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Automated classification of advertisement videos from the general program videos is emerging as an essential task that is expected to support the television (TV) viewers to have a seamless visual experience without being hampered by commercial advertisement videos (ADD). The demand for a solution is gaining momentum which will enable the viewers to skip the advertisements and move automatically to another channel. This can be achieved just by classifying the extracted frames of videos of advertisements and non-Advertisements videos (NADD) which consist of more visual information. In this present work, the descriptive feature is derived through the block intensity comparison technique and applied on 8x8 block size of the frames. The best performing features are identified and selected by decision tree (J48) algorithm and these selected features are used for classification by the Ripple Down Rule Learner (RIDOR) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the performance evaluation of RIDOR algorithm, the importance of dimensionality reduction and the comparative study of various classifiers. Therefore, RIDOR achieved the best classification accuracy of 87.12% is reported for further study. © 2016 IEEE.",8x8 block size; Advertisement videos; BICC feature; Classification; Decision tree; Non-Advertisement videos; Ripple Down Rule Learner (RIDOR) algorithm,Data mining; Decision trees; Embedded systems; Trees (mathematics); Advertisement videos; BICC feature; Block sizes; Non-Advertisement videos; Ripple Down Rules; Classification (of information),,Chaturvedi P.K.Singh R.Sharma R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Feature subset selection for microarray data aims at reducing the number of genes so that useful information can be extracted from the samples. Reducing the dimension of data sets further helps in improving the computational efficiency of the learning model. In this paper, we propose a modified algorithm based on the tabu search as local search procedures to a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) for high dimensional microarray data sets. The proposed Tabu based Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure algorithm is named as TGRASP. In TGRASP, a new parameter has been introduced named as Tabu Tenure and the existing parameters, NumIter and size have been modified. We observed that different parameter settings affect the quality of the optimum. The second proposed algorithm known as FFGRASP (Firefly Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) uses a firefly optimization algorithm in the local search optimization phase of the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Firefly algorithm is one of the powerful algorithms for optimization of multimodal applications. Experimental results show that the proposed TGRASP and FFGRASP algorithms are much better than existing algorithm with respect to three performance parameters viz. accuracy, run time, number of a selected subset of features. We have also compared both the approaches with a unified metric (Extended Adjusted Ratio of Ratios) which has shown that TGRASP approach outperforms existing approach for six out of nine cancer microarray datasets and FF- GRASP performs better on seven out of nine datasets.",Classification; Feature selection; Firefly algorithm; GRASP; Hill climbing; Microarray; Tabu search,Bioluminescence; Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Data mining; Diseases; Feature extraction; Genes; Heuristic algorithms; Local search (optimization); Microarrays; Tabu search; Feature subset selection; Firefly algorithms; GRASP; Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure; Hill climbing; Hybrid feature selections; Multimodal application; Optimization algorithms; Optimization,,,University of Zagreb,13301136,,,,English,J.

Analyzing all these databases is one of the difficult tasks in the medical environment. In order to warehouse all these databases and to analyze the patient's condition, we need an efficient data mining technique. In this paper, an efficient data mining technique for warehousing clinical databases using Rough Set Theory (RST) and Fuzzy Logic is proposed. Our proposed methodology contains two phases - (i) Clustering and (ii) Classification. In the first phase, Rough Set Theory is used for clustering. Clustering is one of the data mining techniques for warehousing the heterogeneous data bases. Clustering technique is used to group data that have similar characteristics in the same cluster and also to group the data that have dissimilar characteristics with other clusters. After clustering the data, similar objects will be clustered in one cluster and the dissimilar objects will be clustered under another cluster. The RST can be reduced the complexity. Then in the second phase, these clusters are classified using Fuzzy Logic. Normally, Classification with Fuzzy Logic is generated more number of rules. Since the RST is utilized in our work, the classification using Fuzzy can be done with less amount of complexity. The proposed approach is evaluated using various clinical related databases from heart disease datasets - Cleveland, Switzerland and Hungarian.

Road safety is a term associated with the planning and implementing certain strategy to overcome the road and traffic accidents. Road accident data analysis is a very important means to identify various factors associated with road accidents and can help in reducing the accident rate. The heterogeneity of road accident data is a big challenge in road safety analysis. In this study, we are making use of latent class clustering (LCC) and k-modes clustering technique on a new road accident data from Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India. The main focus to use both the techniques is to identify which technique performs better. Initially, we applied LCC and k-modes clutering technique on road accident data to form different clusters. Further, Frequent Pattern (FP) growth technique is applied on the clusters formed and entire data set (EDS). The rules generated for each clusters do not prove any cluster analysis technique superior over other. However, it is certain that both techniques are well suited to remove heterogeneity of road accident data. The rules generated for each cluster and EDS proves that heterogeneity exists in the entire data set and clustering prior to analysis certainly reduces heterogeneity from the data set and provides better solutions. The rules for Haridwar district reveals some important information which can used to develop policies to prevent and overcome the accident rate. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Data mining; FP growth; Heterogeneity; Road accident analysis,Accident prevention; Accidents; Data mining; Highway accidents; Losses; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Transportation; Cluster analysis technique; Clustering techniques; Comparative analysis; FP growths; Heterogeneity; Road accident analysis; Road accident data; Road safety analysis; Cluster analysis,"Kumar, S.; Centre for Transportation Systems (CTRANS), Indian Institute of Technology RoorkeeIndia; email: sachinagnihotri16@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,18686478,,,,English,Evol.

The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Ontology-based multimedia information retrieval (OMIR); ranking; semantic annotation technique; semantic similarity; tag-based information prediction,Clustering algorithms; Computerized tomography; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Image processing; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Ontology; Search engines; Semantics; Multimedia information retrieval; ranking; Semantic annotations; Semantic similarity; Tag-based; Data mining,"Uma, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jayamatha Engineering CollegeIndia; email: umachand97@gmail.com",,Taylor and Francis Inc.,1969722,,CYSYD,,English,Cybern Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015090312

Present traffic management system performs mere traffic monitoring and event handling which cannot be a viable system for highly populous country like India and China. In this paper, we propose a system that will predict the densely populated roads based on the present and past traffic congestion. This system also suggests the alternate paths for the given source and destination. A simulation of live stream of online data is performed on legacy traffic data set which is processed incrementally. Density based clustering is applied after Fuzzification of data to assign weightage for the densely congested path on the route map. The weightage for the path on the given time helps to decide the best route form the source to destination. Floyd’s algorithm is also applied to find the shortest set of alternate path for the given source to destination. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",Big data; Clustering; DBScan; Spatial data mining; Traffic management,Big data; Data mining; Highway administration; Motor transportation; Traffic control; Clustering; DBScan; Density-based Clustering; Hybrid clustering; Spatial data mining; Traffic management; Traffic management systems; Traffic monitoring; Traffic congestion,"Chang, V.; Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool UniversityChina; email: ic.victor.chang@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019054693

Since deaf and dumb people cannot communicate with normal person so they have to depend on some sort of visual communication. Gesture shows an expressive movement of body parts such as physical movements of head, face, arms, hand or body which convey some message. Gesture recognition is the mathematical interpretation of a human motion by a computing device. Sign language provide best communication platform for the hearing impaired and dumb person to communicate with normal person. The objective of this research is to develop a real time system for hand gesture recognition which recognize hand gestures, features of hands such as peak calculation and angle calculation and then convert gesture images into voice and vice versa. To implement this system we use a simple night vision web-cam with 20 megapixel intensity.

A dataset is said to be imbalanced, if the representation of attribute categories are not approximately even. All the existing classifiers are inclined to perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. Hence it is very essential to go for well balanced dataset for classification. In this paper, the comprehensive Enhanced Minority Oversampling TEchnique (EMOTE) is proposed to balance the dataset.

In particular, this investigation extends the study of issues in ordinal classification with respect to the data set and it examines the current existing solutions. Of which Graph based approach is one of the preprocessing methods exists to deal with this problem. In this paper we propose to extend the existing graph based methodology to expand the probable area of synthetic patterns which provides an efficient technique for oversampling. Experimental results with data sets shows that, our proposed oversampling technique using collinear patterns yields better ordinal classification performance in terms of accuracy and sensitivity compared with currently existing solutions. This technique provides an effective and efficient solution for imbalanced complex data sets. © 2016 IEEE.",Classification; collinear; Data mining; imbalance; Ordinal classification,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Graphic methods; Mobile telecommunication systems; Class imbalance problems; collinear; imbalance; Imbalanced Data-sets; Ordinal classification; Oversampling technique; Pre-processing method; Synthetic patterns; Classification (of information),,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

A recommendation system intends to recommend the items or products to a particular user, based on user's interests, other user's preferences, and their ratings. To provide a better recommendation system, it is necessary to generate associations among products. Since e-commerce and social networking sites generates massive data, traditional data mining approaches perform poorly. Also, the pattern mining algorithm such as the traditional Apriori suffers from high latency in scanning the large database for generating association rules. In this paper we propose a novel pattern mining algorithm called as Frequent Pattern Intersect algorithm (FPIntersect algorithm), which overcomes the drawback of Apriori. The proposed method is validated through simulations, and the results are promising. © 2016 IEEE.",Apriori; Book Recommendation; FPInterscet; Opinion Mining,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Websites; Apriori; Book Recommendation; E-Commerce applications; FPInterscet; Opinion mining; Pattern mining algorithms; Social networking sites; User's preferences; Recommender systems,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Mining out implied information from unstructured data has become essential in several project situations, and this itself is a complex process. Anonymity in data makes the data mining process much more difficult. Data Anonymization techniques, as being used in areas such as Cryptography and Cloud computing, aim to limit the possibilities of unnecessary data mining activities. It is being done by concealing, suppressing or generalizing the parts of information which is irrelevant to each of the individual stakeholders. However, collaboration of such stakeholders who are provided with different versions of anonymized data can reveal the anonymity up to a certain extent. This is an analytical study on such a possibility illustrated with the example of solving an anonymization puzzle involving two different persons who are trying to mine out the suppressed information and concealed knowledge through a collaborative approach in knowledge mining. This study points out the scope for a model driven approach in problem solving, and also the necessity of taking precautionary measures by the practitioners in both Data Anonnymization and Data Mining to resist the mutual competition, based on the ultimate project requirements. © 2016 IEEE.",Anonymity; Anonymization; Collaboration; Data Mining; Knowledge mining; Model Driven Problem Solving; Product and Sum Puzzle,Artificial intelligence; Problem solving; Anonymity; Anonymization; Collaboration; Knowledge mining; Model-driven; Product and Sum Puzzle; Data mining,"Anil Kumar, S.; EE II S, Examinations Wing University of KeralaIndia; email: aks.kerala.India@gmail.com",Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

So it is very relevant to organize documents based on its content. The proposed work address this issue by generating concepts from the documents and these documents are grouped based on a data mining approach. To generate the concept, keywords are extracted from the documents but the extracted set is very large. So for dimensionality reduction, SVD is applied. This paper proposes a novel approach for document clustering based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Concept generation and dimensionality reduction are the two issues addressed here. FCA approach leads to give a fast searching result based on the domain specific keyword.

Traditional recommendation systems while dealing with applications considers only users and items, and do not incorporate user context when delivering recommendations to querying end users. Contextual information can improve the quality of recommendation by overcoming the challenges in recommendation systems. Context-Aware recommendation system (CARS) deals with various types of challenges in existing recommendation systems such as cold-start, sparsity, and scalability. One main challenge is to deliver genuine content to end users that need to be considered. Our work focuses on delivering the genuine content (video) recommendations based on user's context such as network type, time, location etc. The proposed work acts as a content filtering component that filters the content received from the existing system.

One of the tradition and most widely used clustering algorithm is k-Means clustering algorithm, but this algorithm fails to find structural similarity in the data or if the data is non-linear. Spectral clustering is a graph clustering method in which the nodes are clustered and useful if the data is non-linear and it finds clusters of different shapes. A spectral graph is constructed based on the affinity matrix or similarity matrix and the graph cut is found using Laplacian matrix. Traditional spectral clustering use Gaussian kernel function to construct a spectral graph. In this paper we implement PCA based similarity measure for graph construction and generated different Laplacian graphs for spectral clustering. In PCA based similarity measure, the similarity measure based on eigenvalues and its eigenvectors is used for building the graph and we study the efficiency of two types of Laplacian graph matrices. This graph is then clustered using spectral clustering algorithm. Effect of PCA similarity measure is analyzed on two types of Laplacian graphs i.e., un-normalized Laplacian and normalized Laplacian. The outcome shows accurate result of PCA measure on these two Laplacian graphs. It predicts perfect clustering of non-linear data.

With the burgeoning advancement and application of Association Rule Mining in diverse fields ranging from the web usage mining to medical diagnosis and business intelligence to geographical information systems, the decision-making in ARM involves a multi-objective perspective to obtain an interesting and accurate rule set. By considering the Pareto optimality, an optimal trade-off is established between the conflicting and incommensurate performance parameters-comprehensibility, interestingness and confidence of the mined rules. Both, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), being population-based stochastic search method, have found their strong base in mining association rules. We propose an association rule mining scheme using our proposed multi-objective hybridisation of GA-PSO algorithm. The primary advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the hybridisation of multiple objective-GA with multi objective-PSO balances the exploration and exploitation tasks, resulting in valuable extraction of accurate and interpretable mined rules. Evaluating this hybrid model on Bakery dataset shows that with generation of comprehensible, interesting and reliable association rules, the model also converges four times faster than mono-objective hybridisation. © 2016 IEEE.",Association Rule Mining; Genetic Algorithm; Hybrid NSGA-II-MOPSO; Hybridisation; Multi-Objective Optimization; Pareto optimality; Particle Swarm Optimisation,Artificial intelligence; Association rules; Decision making; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Medical information systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stochastic systems; Association rule minings (ARM); Exploration and exploitation; Hybridisation; NSGA-II; Pareto-optimality; Particle swarm optimisation; Performance parameters; Stochastic search methods; Data mining,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

There are various tasks included under Data mining and association rule mining is considered as one of the crucial tasks among its. They are in form of if-then kind of statements which help to find relationships among huge data which do not hold relationship with each other within a relational database or any other information repository. As there are many applications like market basket analysis, detection of fraud in web, medical diagnosis, census data, Customer Relationship Management of credit card business which uses association rules so it is possible to improve the process of Decision making. Security is required for individual transaction and for frequent itemsets when the database is partitioned horizontally among multiple sites. In this case, every site is interested in globally supported association rules without revealing its own local information. To fulfill this goal, We use a secure multi-party algorithm based on secure sum technique to simplify the operation of mining association rule when the database is horizontally partitioned among multiple sites.

Detecting aspects on those reviews are becoming a challenging task because of size complexity. Hence, an automated mechanism is needed to detect the product aspects from the online consumer reviews. In this paper we modeled an unsupervised technique to detect product aspects. In general, the product aspect may be single word or multiple words. To detect single word aspects term dependency analysis is done in which aspects are extracted based on their opinions. Multiword aspects are determined by using a technique called Frequency and Length based aspect relation (FLAT) which is extended from the technique of c-value. In order to increase the precision and recall, two pruning strategies are followed. Finally, an enhanced bootstrapping affinity measure algorithm, Frequency and Inter-relation score (FIR) has been formulated to determine the co-occurrence between the aspects and the seed aspects.

The diseases which include various ailments in the form of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. These diseases are the main cause of hospitalization for elder people. People who have suffered from chronic diseases are needed to repeatedly monitor the vital signs periodically. The vital signs are the basic measurements of body functions. The vital signs of our body are heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood glucose level. The respiratory rate monitor is one of the important vital signs which is useful for patient's who admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The respiratory rate is calculated by using LM35 temperature sensor and monitored the patient's respiration continuously based on voltage value of inhaled and exhaled air. NRF24l01 is used to transmit the sensor data from home to medical center. Then the data are published in a webserver using Ethernet to know the patient's status which is useful for doctor. And also the data is displayed in a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Once the threshold is reached, the alarm is generated and also a message generated in a webpage.

So data hiding is used in the encrypted image, but the main problem is that distortion at the time of data extraction. Reversible data hiding in encrypted image is used to solve this problem. SDS Algorithm gives more security to secret data. RDH recovers the original image after the extraction of the embedded data. In this paper, XOR ciphering technique used for encryption and decryption process. All existing mechanisms embed data by reversibly vacating room after the encrypted images. However, this may result in some errors on data extraction and/or image restoration. In this paper, we suggest a method by holding a space before encryption with a RDH algorithm. Thus, the data hider can embed data in the encrypted image. The embedded data can be data or image. Both data extraction and image recovery will be formed without any error.

Extracting this information to guide decision making in a national security perspective remains a challenging task. The major issue arises due to a large amount of irrelevant information or complexity of unstructured data which makes information extraction and classification a very tedious task while analyzing the textual content for finding various aspects of entities or groups. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards introducing a context-based information extraction using National Security Information Sources (NSIS) which employs different types of knowledge inspired by natural activities of living things. In order to improve classification performance by utilizing relevant information from the sources related to national security and to make better decision, we assume that entities and relationships from these sources can be used to contextualize information from the records. This paper presents a new method for nature-inspired classification after extracting various features from dataset created using social posts and records. Then, analysis of classes of information to concepts available on knowledge sources is carried out to ensure quality of information based on the user needs. The simulation results demonstrated the ability of the proposed method inspired by cultural algorithm to extract group-centric information and improve classification performance using proposed Social Info Finder (SIF). This paper highlights the challenges and application of proposed SIF method to improve information extraction and performance of text classification focusing on national security and related threats. © 2016 IEEE.",Big data; Information extraction; National security; Nature-inspired computing; Social problems,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Decision making; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Integrated circuits; National security; Text processing; Amount of information; Classification performance; Context-based information; Information sources; Nature inspired computing; Quality of information; Social problems; Web-based environment; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) detects various types of malicious network traffic and computer usage, which sometimes may not be detected by a conventional firewall. Recently, many IDS have been developed based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, advanced detection approaches created by combining or integrating evolutionary algorithms and neural networks have shown better detection performance than general machine learning approaches. The present study reports two new hybrid intrusion detection methods; one is based on gravitational search (GS), and other one is a combination of GS and particle swarm optimization (GSPSO). These two techniques have been successfully implemented to train artificial neural network (ANN) and the resulting models: GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN are successfully applied for intrusion detection process. The applicability of these proposed approaches is also compared with other conventional methods such as decision tree, ANN based on gradient descent (GD-ANN), ANN based on genetic algorithm (GA-ANN) and ANN based on PSO (PSO-ANN) by testing with NSL-KDD dataset. Moreover, the results obtained by GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN are found to be statistically significant based on the popular Wilcoxon’s rank sum test as compared to other conventional techniques. The obtained test results reported that the proposed GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN could achieve a maximum detection accuracy of 94.9 and 98.13 % respectively. The proposed models (GS-ANN and GSPSO-ANN) could also achieve good performance when tested with highly imbalanced datasets. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Artificial neural network; Intrusion detection; Intrusion detection system; NSL-KDD,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer networks; Computer system firewalls; Data mining; Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Neural networks; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistical tests; Trees (mathematics); Conventional methods; Conventional techniques; Detection performance; Hybrid intrusion detection; Imbalanced Data-sets; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning approaches; NSL-KDD; Intrusion detection,"Dash, T.; Data Science Laboratory, School of Computer Science, National Institute of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: tirtharaj@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949491626

It has a lot of applications in genetics related studies. Information about gene-disease associations is very important in drug design. Laboratory based methods for gene-disease association extraction need more effort and time. Literature mining is a good method for generating candidate set of genes. Manual methods are not suitable for literature mining as it is highly time-consuming due to the high volume of text data. Even though most of the existing gene-disease association extraction methods use abstracts, full text articles provide more association data. This paper proposes an automatic method for the extraction of disease-associated genes using the property of frequent itemsets from full text articles. The method uses rule based Named Entity Recognition(NER) method for the initial extraction of candidate genes and frequent itemset mining to find the gene-disease associations.

Many text mining methods are generally uses term or keyword based approach. They all have advantages, but get stuck into the issue of synonymy: Two terms have the same meaning and polysemy: One term has many meanings. So phrase based approaches are suggested, but they are not performing better than term based approaches. Instead of term based methods pattern mining methods are suggested, but there is still an open research issue of utilizing and modifying these discovered patterns. Pattern mining methods suffer from pattern misinterpretation and low frequency problem. This paper presents an effective technique to extract patterns that applies the pattern taxonomy model to get close sequential patterns. Pattern deploying process is used to reduce the pattern misinterpretation problem. Pattern co-occurrence matrix (PCM) is applied get the important relationship between close sequential patterns and removes patterns with zero co-occurrence weight. PCM and Inner Pattern Evolution process gives the benefit of reducing low frequency problem.

The necessity of proper information has increased. The most basic tools which provide this service are browser. It traverses the data as per user's query and gives the search results of all related information. Hence, it becomes a time consuming process to find required information. In this paper, the focus is done on content based data mining using ontology and text feature extraction. Content based data mining process focuses on domain of the data. Ontology, itself is a domain based data set information system that will help to achieve required data retrieval in a more appropriate way. The proposed system uses k means clustering algorithm for creation of flat clusters. Flat clusters are the primary classification or clusters of data that are used for Hierarchical clustering. For the proposed system Hierarchical Fuzzy Relational Eigenvector Centrality-based Clustering Algorithm (HFRECCA) is used. This technique of clustering is very fast and gives more accurate results. For more appropriate data retrieval, this system uses text feature extraction algorithm. This algorithm will help to reduce the noisy data from data sets.

Users express their opinion through the reviews. These reviews are used by the individuals and organizations for decision making purpose. It is impossible to read and extract user opinions from such huge number of reviews manually. To solve such problem an automated opinion mining approach is required. It is difficult for a user to read and understand all the reviews. Relevant and important information about these establishments should be fetched from reviews and presented to user in a summarized manner.

In this paper, we propose a ready-for-enterprise book recommendation system using the biclustering algorithm. Our proposed algorithm consists of a hybrid approach containing an initial cluster phase which is taken as input for a biclustering phase. We show that our approach not only proves to be scalable dealing with large amounts of sparsity but also produces results with error values comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches, thereby making it enterprise-friendly. © 2016 IEEE.",biclustering; big data; data mining; recommender systems,Big data; Data mining; Bi-clustering; Biclustering algorithm; Error values; Hybrid approach; Large amounts; Sparse data; State-of-the-art approach; Recommender systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Mining only top-rank-k frequent pattern greatly decrease the number of candidate pattern generated so reduce the mining time.

Twitter is a huge fast emergent micro-blogging social networking platform for users to express their views about politics, products sports etc. These views are useful for businesses, government and individuals. Hence, tweets can be used as a valuable source for mining public's opinion. Sentiment analysis is a process of automatically identifying whether a user-generated text expresses positive, negative or neutral opinion about an entity (i.e. product, people, topic, event etc). The objective of this paper is to give step-by-step detail about the process of sentiment analysis on twitter data using machine learning.

In the case when the reviews are about services that do not have well-defined entity and aspects, doing aspect based opinion analysis is also a challenge. This paper is about summarization of online review in such domains. Additionally, extractive summarization sometimes fails to represent all the important topics due to its constraint of using sentences as information units. Such summaries also do not depict linkages between topics and building that is left to the reader. In our work, we have used sentiment analysis to extract the subjective part of the reviews and then adopted an unsupervised graph theoretical approach to extract the key phrases. Finally, semantic similarities between these key phrases are calculated to discover the interlinkages and a tree like review summary is generated using standard graph theory techniques. © 2016 IEEE.",key phrase; sentiment analysis; similarity; Summarization; unsupervised,Computation theory; Forestry; Graph theory; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Trees (mathematics); Key-phrase; Sentiment analysis; similarity; Summarization; unsupervised; Data mining,,Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

New threats are create everyday by individuals and organizations that attack network systems. Intrusion is a malicious, externally induced operational fault. Intrusion is used as a key to compromise the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a computer resource. Hence intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming a key part of system defence, to detect anomalies and attacks in the network. Data mining based IDS can effectively identify intrusions. Average one dependence estimators (AODE) is one of the recent enhancements of naïve bayes algorithm. AODE solves the problem of independence by averaging all models generated by traditional one dependence estimator and is well suited for incremental learning. In this paper, we propose intelligent network intrusion detection system using AODE algorithm for the detection of different types of attacks. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we conducted experiments on NSL-KDD data set.

In an era where information has become the inherent necessity of human beings, its increased relevance and usefulness has taken focus as need of the hour. The most important part of this association rule mining is the mining of item sets that are frequent. Market basket analysis is done by companies in order to retrieve itemsets that are frequent and often used together by customers. Apriori algorithm is a widely used technique in order to find those combinations of itemsets. However, when any of these frequent itemsets increases in length, the algorithm needs to pass through many iterations and, as a result, the performance drastically decreases. In this paper, we propose a modification to the apriori algorithm by using a hash function which divides the frequent item sets into buckets. Further, we propose a novel technique to be used in conjunction with the apriori algorithm by eliminating infrequent itemsets from the candidate set. In this top down approach, it finds the frequent itemsets without going through several iterations, thus saving time and space. By discovering a large maximal frequent itemset very early in the algorithm, all its subsets are also frequent hence we no longer need to scan them. Clearly, the proposed technique has an advantage over the existing apriori algorithm when the most frequent itemset's length is long. © 2016 IEEE.",Aprori algorithm; Association rule mining; Data mining; Hash function; Maximal frequent itemset,Association rules; Hash functions; Learning algorithms; Apriori algorithms; Candidate sets; Frequent item sets; Frequent itemset; Market basket analysis; Maximal frequent itemsets; Novel techniques; Top down approaches; Data mining,"Shah, A.; Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal UniversityIndia; email: ashish.shah1512@gmail.com",Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Some of the data mining techniques like clustering can be used for either forecasting or description and segmentation helps to understand customer resources based on information. Here an intruder can get the sensitive information of a particular person even if the removal of personal identifiable information like name, address etc. Intruders can get the information based on QI value in the dataset which in known as membership disclosure attack. K-anonymity doesn't provide appropriated privacy for the data against those attacks. While using data mining techniques there gets a privacy problem, in this paper it provides an effective privacy definition called l-diversity. In this there are 'l' well represented values for sensitive attribute. © 2016 IEEE.",Annonimization; Homogeneity attack; Member ship disclosure; Regression,Customer satisfaction; Data privacy; Natural language processing systems; Sales; Annonimization; Customer information; Financial institution; Homogeneity attack; Member ship disclosure; Regression; Sensitive attribute; Sensitive informations; Data mining,,Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Tree based approaches have been extensively studied and widely used for their parallel processing capability. Itemset Tree is an efficient data structure to represent the transactions for performing selective mining of frequent itemsets and association rules. The transactions are inserted incrementally and provide on-demand ad-hoc querying on the tree for fining frequent itemsets and association rules for different support and confidence values. However the size of tree grows larger for unbounded data streams limiting the scalability. In this paper, we propose an Approximation based Incremental Memory Efficient Itemset Tree (AIMEIT) algorithm which is an extension to Memory Efficient Itemset Tree (MEIT) algorithm to construct the itemset tree from data stream. The user defined minimum support of interest has been used along with Lossy counting algorithm to prune transactions before inserting them into the tree. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more memory efficient and takes lesser processing time for constructing the tree. © 2016 IEEE.",association rule; data mining; data stream; frequent itemset; itemset tree; lossy counting,Approximation algorithms; Association rules; Data communication systems; Data mining; Data stream; Efficient data structures; Frequent itemset; Frequent itemset mining; Itemset; lossy counting; Mining frequent itemsets; Support and confidence; Trees (mathematics),,Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Numerous researches have been proposed to ward off the inherent security risks, though these solutions are not enough to identify and remove all the vulnerabilities. In this paper, a self-adaptive IV-Phase MAP Security Architecture is proposed, which is inspired by the Biological Immune System, with the prime objective of detecting unknown malicious mobile agents. In this context, data mining methods are studied for the detection of unknown malicious executable. In particular, Boyer Moore pattern matching algorithm and N-gram feature analysis of mobile agent using a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, facilitate the discovery of known and unknown malicious content from incoming mobile agent in the proposed architecture, and protects against the Man In The Middle (MITM) attack, the Masquerading Attack, the Replay attack, the Repudiation attack and the Unauthorized Access Attack. The architecture is designed and implemented in IBM Aglets. A comprehensive 5-fold cross validation scheme on a large collection of malicious and non-malicious files is performed while performing Classification technique involving Feature Selection Method. The propitious experimental outcomes express that the performance (time and security) and accuracy of proposed architecture outperform the earlier known related schemes and makes the proposed architecture suitable for MAP protection in the Mobile Agent Environment (MAE). Above all, these findings exhibit wide-ranging newness, since the concept of machine learning has never been employed so far in the sphere of Mobile Agents System (MAS). Hence the proposed work is likely to be of great interest to the researchers who particularly deal with MAS security. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Feature selection; K-nearest neighbor classification; Malicious mobile agent; N-gram feature extraction; Nonce-based authentication; Pattern matching,Classification (of information); Computer architecture; Computer viruses; Data mining; Feature extraction; Image matching; Immune system; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Pattern matching; Biological immune system; Classification technique; Distributed environments; Feature selection methods; K-nearest neighbor classification; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack; N-grams; Mobile agents,"Hans, R.; Assistant Professor, Department of CSE, DAV UniversityIndia; email: rahulhans@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006783227

The recent research focused on mining large cardinality itemsets called as colossal itemsets which are significant to many applications, especially in the field of bioinformatics. The existing frequent colossal itemset mining algorithms are unsuccessful in discovering complete set of significant frequent colossal itemsets. The mined colossal itemsets from existing algorithms provide erroneous support information which affects association analysis. Mining significant frequent colossal itemsets with accurate support information helps in attaining a high-level accuracy of association analysis. The proposed work highlights a novel pre-processing technique and bottom-up row enumeration algorithm to mine significant frequent colossal itemsets with accurate support information.

In detection process, developers try to find out loopholes in the prior proposed models while in prediction model they try to develop a new theory that mitigates those loopholes. In our proposed approach we work over a mathematical model that can be a replacement of a well-known data mining algorithm K-NN (K nearest neighbor), which uses clusters for classification. Our proposed methodology is based on feature selection. This feature selection process is based on correlation coefficient that can be defined by the user. After feature selection, we tried to achieve the rate of change of the target attribute with respect to the other attributes. We have classified the data vectors according to the rate of change of target value (Effort) and attributes obtained after feature selection. Target value (Effort) will be fixing for whole processing. Finally we applied regression to obtain a mathematical model for the corresponding class. © 2016 IEEE.",class partition; detection and prediction; equivalence relation; software effort estimation; step size; svm,Computer software; Data mining; Equivalence classes; Estimation; Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Correlation coefficient; Data mining algorithm; Detection process; Equivalence relations; K-nearest neighbors; Prediction methodology; Software effort estimation; Step size; Feature extraction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

In order to protect organizational databases, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are deployed. Non-signature based IDS are found to be reasonable better than signature based IDS. In this paper, a new data mining based approach Fuzzy Association Data Dependency Rule Miner (FADDRM) has been proposed for detecting malicious transactions. The proposed anomaly based approach focuses on mining data dependencies between data items in the database using fuzzy association rule mining. The data dependencies are mined using the transactions from the database log. The transactions which are not compliant to the data dependencies are treated as malicious transactions. The proposed approach is exemplified using a data set for typical banking organization and the result shows that FADDRM can detect malicious transactions more effectively as comparison to other approaches cited in literature. © 2016 IEEE.",clustering; data dependency; Database Intrusion Detection; sequential rule mining,Association rules; Data mining; Database systems; Environmental protection; Fuzzy rules; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); clustering; Data dependencies; Database security; Fuzzy association rule; Fuzzy associations; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious transaction; Sequential rule; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Knowledge of the present situation is highly beneficial for a wide range of applications. An algorithm called pcStream can be used to extract situations from a numerical data stream in an unsupervised manner. Although pcStream outperforms other stream clustering algorithms at this task, pcStream has two major flaws. The first is its complexity due to continuously performing principal component analysis (PCA). The second is its difficulty in detecting emerging situations whose distributions overlap in the same feature space. In this paper we introduce pcStream2, a variant of pcStream which employs windowing and persistence in order to distinguish between emerging overlapping concepts. We also propose the use of incremental PCA (IPCA) to reduce the overall complexity and memory requirements of the algorithm. Although any IPCA algorithm can be used, we use a novel IPCA algorithm called Just-In-Time PCA which is better suited for processing streams. JIT-PCA makes intelligent 'short cuts' in order to reduce computations. We provide experimental results on real-world datasets that demonstrates how the proposed improvements make pcStream2 a more accurate and practical tool for situation space mining. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The system is subjected to variable speed and torque which lead to faults in gears. This paper presents condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of spur gear conceived as pattern recognition problem. Pattern recognition has the following two main phases: feature extraction and feature classification. Under feature extraction, statistical features like skewness, standard deviation, variance, root-mean-square (RMS) value, kurtosis, range, minimum value, maximum value, sum, median, and crest factor are considered as features of the signal in the fault diagnostics. These features are extracted from vibration signals obtained from the experimental setup through a piezoelectric sensor. The vibration signals from the sensor are captured for normal tooth, wear tooth, broken tooth, and broken tooth under load. The feature extraction is done and the best features are selected using decision tree (J48 algorithm). The selected best features are used to train the fuzzy classifier for the fault diagnosis. A fuzzy classifier is built and tested with representative data. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",Decision tree; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Fuzzy; Rule learning,Classification (of information); Condition monitoring; Data mining; Decision trees; Extraction; Failure analysis; Feature extraction; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Gears; Higher order statistics; Pattern recognition; Spur gears; Statistical methods; Trees (mathematics); Feature classification; Fuzzy; Pattern recognition problems; Piezoelectric sensors; Root mean square values; Rule learning; Standard deviation; Statistical features; Fault detection,"Krishnakumari, A.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Velammal Engineering College, Anna UniversityIndia; email: a_krishnakumari@yahoo.co.in",,Springer London,2683768,,IJATE,,English,Int J Adv Manuf Technol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983405845

At the same time, several types of machine learning methods do not depend on such prior explicitly expressed domain information. However, such methods require especially in case of operating learning phase, only data sets are being considered. The recent work introduces a new model called Regularized Monotonic Fuzzy SVM (RMC-FSVM) for solving problem that is mentioned above. The scalability with respect to RMC-FSVM mechanisms have been proposed for mitigating the respective overheads corresponding to requirements of memory and time. The Reduce framework is integrated to RMC-FSVM referred to as MRRMC-FSVM which can be efficiently parallelized and scaled to very big problems along with the count of hundreds of thousands of training vectors is described. In MRRMC-FSVM, partial outcomes are later integrated followed by 'Cascade' mode of filtration in the MRRMC-FSVM. The approach of Cascade based MRRMC-FSVM can extend over multiple numbers of processors having a reduced communication overhead and needs very less memory, as the kernel matrices are way much smaller in comparison to a regular MRRMC-FSVM. In the present study, the experimental work implies the scope for integrating the previously known monotonicity constraints along with the framework of MRRMC-FSVM as it considered to be the potential way to overcome the scalability issue seen the datasets and accomplished greater accuracy while applying to classification challenges. © 2016 IEEE.",Data mining; Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (SVM); Map Reduce Framework (MR); monotonicity constraint; prior knowledge; regularization,Classification (of information); Data mining; Filtration; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Scalability; Fuzzy support vector machines; Map-reduce; Monotonicity constraint; Prior knowledge; regularization; Support vector machines,,Satheesh Kumar J.Devi T.Rajeswari R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This research presents sentiments analysis on Indian movie review corpus using machine learning classifier. Bayesian Classifier has been used in this study for testing feature selection mechanics. This classifier is trained on the words/features of the corpus extracted using five feature selection algorithms (Chi-square, Info-gain, Gain-Ratio, One-R and relief attribute) and a comparative study have been performed amongst them. The classifier and feature selection approaches were evaluated by two different metrics (F-Value, and False Positive). Results of this study show that: for maximum number of features, Relief-F feature selection approach is found to be good with better F-value, Low FP Rate.

This data is received continually during the entire mission life of the Satellite. Hence a huge volume of Data is collected for any given satellite. Data Mining techniques are now regularly applied to analyse such large quantity of data for outlier analysis, fault detection in past data and fault prediction. In the present work, hidden relationships between apparently unrelated Telemetry parameters are mined by applying Rule Induction and Association Rule mining algorithms separately on a data set with randomly selected parameters. From the results obtained, a comparison is made to assess the suitability of either of these techniques to the application domain.

Association rule mining is the main area in the field of data mining exploration with wide range of applications. Determining the frequent item-sets in large dataset is the core task of association rule mining and it is frequently used by business decision makers to improve their future business strategy. Numerous algorithms have been dedicated in the literature and tremendous progresses have been made to find frequent patterns. Most of the methods introduced in the literature find all frequent patters for all attributes in the dataset. We introduced TR-FCTM (Transaction Reduction-Frequent Count Table method) for the same. Even though this method outperformed than Apriori and FP-tree, the performance of that technique was reduced slowly when the total attributes in the data bank increases. Sometimes it is needed to catch all significant patterns for a few significant related attributes selected from total attributes in the data bank by the field expert to improve the business in future.

The study also applies data mining techniques to extract the knowledge from the historical agriculture data set to predict rice crop yield for Kharif season of Tropical Wet and Dry climatic zone of India. The data set has been visualised in Microsoft Office Excel using scatter plots. The classification algorithms have been executed in the free and open source data mining tool WEKA. The experimental results provided include sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, Mathews correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, relative absolute error and root relative squared error. General trends in the data visualisation show that decrease in precipitation in the selected climatic zone increases the rice crop yield and increase in minimum, average or maximum temperature for the season increases the rice crop yield. For the current data set experimental results show that J48 and LADTree achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Web Applications as the new task-centric and action-oriented facilities have assumed a distinguished role in today's Web. At the same time, faults in these Web Applications are tedious and hard to test due to the labor and resource intensive nature of testing. Thus, making it essential to use automated strategies like fault based testing that can test the continuously advancing web. Fault based testing uses fault classification as a baseline to make testing cost-effective and efficient, hence making fault classification necessary. Fault classification in Web Applications is a course of action of developing models to segregate the various kinds of faults for real world fault based testing. Manual classification tends to be strenuous and therefore in this paper, we intend to predict an efficient automated model which will classify the faults. Our model uses Text Mining and Machine Learning technique to classify the faults of three open source Web Applications, namely, the qaManager, bitWeaver and WebCalender. We provide a comparative study among four models in which different Machine Learning techniques are used namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Multinomial Naïve Bayes. To analyze the performance of these models, Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained from Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and 10-fold validation are used. Results show that all considered Machine Learning techniques prove to be efficient in the classification of faults. Apart from this, analysis also shows that the performance of Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier is better than the other three classifiers. © 2017 ACM.",Classification; Decision tree; Faults; Naïve Bayes; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Text mining; Web,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Faulting; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sodium; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Swarm intelligence; Text processing; Area under the curves; Comparative studies; Fault classification; Fault-based testing; Machine learning techniques; Manual classification; Receiver operating characteristics; Text mining; Education,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

It reduces the load of computational cost and prediction time on classification algorithm by selecting only the salient features from the data set for learning. The main challenges while applying feature selection on high dimensional data (HDD) are: handling the relevancy, redundancy and correlation between features. The proposed algorithm works with the three main steps to overcome these issues. It focuses on filtering strategy for its effectiveness in handling the data sets with large size and high dimensions. Initially to measure the relevancy of features with respect to class, fisher score is calculated for each feature independently. Next, only relevant features are passed to the clustering algorithm to check the redundancy of features. Finally the correlation between features is calculated using maximum spanning tree and the most appropriate features are filtered out. The classification accuracy of the presented approach is validated by using C4.5, IB1 and Naive Bayes classifier. The proposed algorithm gives high classification accuracy when compared against the accuracies given by three different classifiers on the datasets containing features extracted from fisher score method and dataset containing all the features or full-featured dataset. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature Selection; Fisher Score; High Dimensional Data; Kruskal's algorithm; Markov Clustering,Classifiers; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Data mining; Feature extraction; Redundancy; Trees (mathematics); Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Correlation between features; Fisher score; High dimensional data; Kruskal's algorithms; Markov clustering; Naive Bayes classifiers; Classification (of information),,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

But, when many morphologically similar terms refer to separate concepts (showing fuzzy behavior), then arriving at a solution becomes difficult. Before applying any knowledge generation or representation techniques to such polysemic words, word sense disambiguation becomes imperative. Unfortunately, with an exponential increase in data, the process of information extraction becomes difficult. For text data this information is represented in form of context vectors. But, the generation of context vectors is limited by the memory heap and RAM of traditional systems. The aim of this study is to examine and propose a framework for computing context vectors of large dimensions over Big Data, trying to overcome the bottleneck of traditional systems. The proposed framework is based on set of mappers and reducers, implemented on Apache Hadoop. With increase in the size of the input dataset, the dimensions of the related concepts (in form of resultant matrix) increases beyond the capacity of a single system. This bottleneck of handling large dimensions is resolved by clustering. As observed from the study, transition from a single system to a distributed system ensures that the process of information extraction runs smoothly, even with an increase in data. © 2016 IEEE.",Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Hadoop; Text Mining,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer software; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Random access storage; Vectors; Data analytics; Exponential increase; Hadoop; Knowledge generations; Representation techniques; Text mining; Traditional systems; Word Sense Disambiguation; Data mining,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The algorithm used for clustering directly influences the results obtained from applying the clustering algorithm (clusters). Data clustering is done in order to identify the patterns and trends not identifiable from just looking at the data. Clustering may be supervised (if the machine training data set is available) or unsupervised (if the machine training data set is not available). Unsupervised clustering is usually done using k-Means Algorithm (using any distance, the most common being Euclidean and Manhattan Distance). The drawback of k-means algorithm for a large set are the rigorous calculations that need to be done to cluster a data set into multiple data subsets for every single iteration, thereby limiting its efficiency and use for large data sets. We propose a range based single pass clustering algorithm that clusters data on the basis of the range which it falls in, where the ranges are calculated using simple arithmetic mean between two values.

The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated on three datasets including two satiric and one ironic dataset. The proposed methodology performed well on one satiric dataset and yielded promising results on the remaining two datasets. Moreover, we found out some interesting common characteristics of satire and irony like affective process (negative emotion), personal concern (leisure), biological process (body and sexual), perception (see), informal language (swear), social process (male), cognitive process (certain), and psycholinguistic (concreteness and imageability), which were extracted from three corpora. Of particular significance is the comparison of our approach with human annotators' evaluations, which served as a baseline in these tasks. © 2016",Customer reviews; Ensembled feature subset selection; Irony detection; LIWC; Satire detection; Satiric news; Sentiment analysis; TAALES,Data mining; Customer review; Feature subset selection; LIWC; Satiric news; Sentiment analysis; TAALES; Feature extraction,"Ravi, V.; Center of Excellence in Analytics, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, Castle Hills Road No. 1, Masab Tank, India; email: padmarav@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,9507051,,KNSYE,,English,Knowl Based Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009363573

Many researchers have been taken a lot of interest in this area and proposed their work. The Sentiment analysis is done on the basis of Document, Sentence and feature levels. But the first two levels didn't consider object features that have been commented in a sentence. So the feature level sentiment analysis is more appropriate compare to both. Different types of tools and approaches have been used by the researchers for pre-processing, tagging, semantic orientation, and finally for calculating scores for deriving sentiments of the reviews. But the problems, found in analysis generally are, where reviews contain the negative, intensifier, conjunctive and synonyms words. And other problems are coreference resolution; anaphora resolution, named-entity recognition, and word-sense disambiguation. These problem are unresolved sometimes so that the performance of sentiment analysis decrease. A lot of work is done mainly in Product, News, Sports domains. We proposed our work in Movie Reviews because it's a more attractive area, for now-A-days generation where multiple sites allow users to submit reviews describing what they either liked or disliked about a particular movie. In this work we have proposed a system which classifies the polarity of the movie reviews on the basis of features by handling negation, intensifier, conjunction and synonyms with appropriate pre-processing steps. We have used SentiWordNet tool for calculating the scores of reviews. © 2016 IEEE.",Feature Selection; Sentiment Analysis; Sentiment classification; SentiWordNet,Data mining; Feature extraction; Motion pictures; Semantics; Text processing; Co-reference resolutions; Named entity recognition; Pre-processing step; Semantic orientation; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; SentiWordNet; Word Sense Disambiguation; Natural language processing systems,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This problem refers to the uneven distribution of instances among the classes which poses difficulty in the classification of rare instances. Several undersampling as well as oversampling methods were proposed to deal with such imbalance. Many undersampling techniques do not consider distribution of information among the classes, similarly some oversampling techniques lead to the overfitting or may cause overgeneralization problem. This paper proposes an MLP-based undersampling technique (MLPUS) which will preserve the distribution of information while doing undersampling. This reduction can be done on the basis of stochastic measure evaluation.

Data streams with the curse of dimensionality are founded to be the root sources of Big Data. The commonly used procedure for data sourced from data streams is continuously making batch based model and inducing algorithms which is infeasible for real-time data mining. An optimal feature subset which is derived by mining over high dimensional data search space grows exponentially in size which leads to an intractable demand in computation. In order to solve this problem which is based on high dimensionality and streaming format of data in big data, a new feature selection is proposed in this paper which work on the data collected from e-commerce sites having high dimensionality and particularly designed for mining data, by using ant colony optimization (ACO) type of swarm search for selecting proper feature using the association rule to search more similar features.

Aggregate function computation and iceberg queries are important and common in many applications of data mining and data warehousing because people are usually interested in looking for unusual patterns by computing aggregate functions across many attributes. In spite of complexity of these queries decision makers want their request to be processed quickly. But these queries often require very long response time. So it is very important to process efficiently these expensive queries with aggregate functions in data warehousing environment. Presently available Iceberg query (IBQ) processing techniques faces the problem of empty Bitwise AND operation, and require more I/O access to execute query. None of the research provides the model for all aggregate functions. Proposed research applies look ahead matching strategy on Bitmap Index (BI) of query attributes. Before performing actual operation the analysis of logical operation is done if it satisfy threshold condition then only complete operation will be perform. In this way look ahead matching(LAM) strategy reduces the I/O access cost and solve the problem of empty bitwise AND operation.

This has fostered & promoted sentiment analysis as a dynamic & potential area of research where new techniques & models need to be explored for continuous improvement in result accuracy. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic neural network (PNN) with a self-Adaptive approach to perform sentiment analysis on tweets. Probabilistic Neural Network as a multi-layered feed-forward neural network is an apt choice because of its prominent features of adaptive learning, fault tolerance, parallelism and generalization which provide a superior performance. Also, the smoothing parameter of PNN plays a great role for predicting an accurate class of classifier. So a self-Adaptive algorithm is used to calculate and optimize the smoothing parameter in our research. Two types of Probabilistic Neural Network models are implemented in the proposed approach. First model of PNN, also called as PNNS has single value of smoothing parameter for whole network. Second model, also called as PNNC has different values of smoothing parameter for each class. The training and testing dataset is collected from Twitter using Twitter API. Accuracy of both model PNNS and PNNC is calculated and result shows that the PNNC has a better performance than PNNS. © 2016 IEEE.",Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN); Smoothing parameter,Adaptive algorithms; Fault tolerance; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Continuous improvements; Multi-layered feed-forward neural networks; Probabilistic neural network models; Probabilistic neural networks; Self adaptive algorithms; Self adaptive approach; Smoothing parameter; Social networking sites; Data mining,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

To reduce the national maternal mortality rate the government is doing efforts and has introduced many schemes like JSSK and JSY to create awareness towards the institutional deliveries and to benefit the rural women economically. Despite such programmatic efforts by Indian government the goal to achieve maternal mortality less than 100 per 100,000 live births is far away. To identify the limited success in maternal mortality reduction in India we have compared the maternal health indicators data with some demographic indicators data to rectify the problem. In this paper, we have carried out an empirical data analysis for maternal health in India using secondary data collected from NHRM-HMIS portal. The data is also collected from a statistical publication of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare which consists of most updated data of Annual Health Survey (AHS-4.) and District Level Household Survey (DLHS-4) on maternal health for period 2011-13. To carry out our data analysis we have used Tanagra, a data mining tool to visualize the realistic glimpses of maternal health indicators status in various states of India. In this study we have found that the maternal health status is remarkable in Kerala whereas the situation is totally reverse in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This has prompted us to state that if much more effort towards MMR reduction will be put on these states can improve the overall MMR rate of the nation as these states are highly female populated states of the nation. © 2016 IEEE.",Annual Health Survey; Ante Natal Care; Domestic Level Household Survey; Health Management Information System; India; Infant Mortality Rate; Maternal Health; Maternal Mortality Rate,Data handling; Data mining; Health; Information analysis; Population statistics; Surveys; Ante Natal Care; Health management information systems; Health surveys; Household surveys; India; Infant mortality rates; Maternal healths; Maternal mortality; Information management,,Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Scalability, high dimensionality, distributed data and often it also requires huge amount of computational resources in terms of space and time to extract the hidden patterns in the data. In addition, the data has to be available at one location. But in today's era the data are often inherently distributed in several databases. Hence, due to the limited bandwidth, centralized processing of the data is highly inefficient. Therefore, distributed computing becomes very important for efficient DM, both in terms of space and time. This can be done by developing a mechanism to mine the massive data by applying DM in a non-centralized way that distributes the work load seamlessly among the available sites. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an algorithm distributed multi-class rule based classification (DiRUC) which implements repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER) at local level and then merges into a global level in a distributed manner. The algorithm first constructs the local rule sets for the distributed data and then at each iteration the local models are sent from one location to other. Finally, the global model is constructed by efficiently merging these local models and is made available at each site for further prediction of the class labels. The performance (accuracy and efficiency) analysis of the algorithm is done for the five data sets with different parameters and the result shows that the proposed approach DiRUC outperforms the normal RIPPER and Ischibuchi et al. island model. © 2016 IEEE.",Distributed data mining; HADOOP; RIPPER,Big data; Classification (of information); Computer privacy; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Iterative methods; Social sciences computing; Centralized processing; Computational resources; Distributed data mining; HADOOP; High dimensionality; Limited bandwidth; RIPPER; Rule-based classification; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Though many researchers have implemented various algorithms and techniques for character recognition in different languages, ancient characters conversion still poses a big challenge. Because image recognition technology has reached near-perfection when it comes to scanning English and other language text. But optical character recognition (OCR) software capable of digitizing printed Tamil text with high levels of accuracy is still elusive. Only a few people are familiar with the ancient characters and make attempts to convert them into written documents manually. The proposed system overcomes such a situation by converting all the ancient historical documents from inscriptions and palm manuscripts into Tamil digital text format. It converts the digital text format using Tamil unicode. Our algorithm comprises different stages: i) image preprocessing, ii) feature extraction, iii) character recognition and iv) digital text conversion. The first phase conversion accuracy of the Brahmi script rate of our algorithm is 91.57% using the neural network and image zoning method.

Understanding of land cover changes that occurred during the past decade is necessary to formulate policies and actions for sustainable land management. Land cover changes affect ecosystem and global climate. These changes transform natural habitats of plant and animal species and also modify air temperature and near surface moisture content which leads to many drastic changes in climate. Land cover change study helps climate and ecosystem scientists in understanding role of land cover changes in bringing climate and ecosystem changes. This paper has used segmentation-based data mining approach on MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data for understanding of land cover changes in states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Data smoothing using Savitzky-Golay filtering method has been performed before applying algorithm for land cover change detection. Algorithm is able to identify the time point of change along with type of land cover change. The findings show a lot of industrialization and urbanization in Surat and its satellite towns. Other major cities such as Ahmedabad and Jaipur have shown urban growth towards periphery over a period of time. Although agricultural area has got reduced due to urban growth but barren land has got converted into agricultural area as irrigation facility has improved over time due to emergence of Narmada Canal Network. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).,Agricultural; Change point; LANDSAT; LISS3; MODIS; NDVI; Remote sensing data; Savitzky-Golay filtering; Segmentation; Urban,Agriculture; Data mining; Ecology; Ecosystems; Image segmentation; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Signal filtering and prediction; Urban growth; Agricultural; Change-points; LANDSAT; LISS3; MODIS; NDVI; Remote sensing data; Savitzky Golay Filtering; Urban; Climate change,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Boundary detection from LiDAR data consists of four steps: LiDAR data processing, Initial boundary detection, Boundary tracing, and Boundary regularization. Following these steps, the initial boundary is determined from LiDAR data of building. Techniques such as boundary tracing and regularization are also applied to generate the building boundary. Here a novel approach is introduced for automatically obtaining the high-rise building boundaries from LiDAR data accurately, with individual plane detection. Then, the computed boundaries are projected on the corresponding images to check its correctness and have compared the result with the boundary obtained from the images. The evaluation results show that this approach effectively detects the boundary. © 2016 IEEE.",Building Boundary; Computational Geometry; LiDAR,Buildings; Computational geometry; Data handling; Data mining; Remote sensing; Tall buildings; Automatic extraction; Boundary detection; Boundary tracing; Evaluation results; High rise building; Lidar point clouds; Plane detection; Research topics; Optical radar,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This paper introduces a system (PSQCR) that produces personalized result at the top of the list with reasonable time limit. For discover the relevant documents with respect to a query, synonymous based query extension is used. Documents are clustered by using k-means clustering method in favor of reducing retrieval time. Maximum matched pattern based ranking method is used to filter out the relevant documents from searching results related to a particular user. User profiles for each user is created by his previous search history. So, this system incorporates the advantages of the four approaches.

Crime analysis is a systematic way of detecting and investigating patterns and trends in crime. In this work, we use various clustering approaches of data mining to analyse the crime data of Tamilnadu. The crime data is extracted from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of India. It consists of crime information about six cities namely Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem, Madurai, Thirunelvelli and Thiruchirapalli from the year 2000-2014 with 1760 instances and 9 attributes to represent the instances. K-Means clustering, Agglomerative clustering and Density Based Spatial Clustering with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms are used to cluster crime activities based on some predefined cases and the results of these clustering are compared to find the best suitable clustering algorithm for crime detection. The result of K-Means clustering algorithm is visualized using Google Map for interactive and easy understanding. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification is used for crime prediction. The performance of each clustering algorithms are evaluated using the metrics such as precision, recall and F-measure, and the results are compared.

As a novel facet, digital governance intends to ensure and assure that stakeholders (government and citizens) have greater access and control over the governance mechanism which leads to a more transparent, accountable and efficient governance. Social media can be used to facilitate interaction between people and can offer a substantial, unparallel platform for extensive involvement of citizens in the governance measures. We propose using an ontology-based analytics on social media that expounds an intelligent governance model where sentiment can be mined for extracting views of citizens towards government practices, policies, rules and monitoring performance. The idea is to deploy ontology based techniques to determine the subjects/topics discussed in the tweets, which are related to Ministries of India: Their policies, rules, schemes, and analyzing the sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) for tweets retrieved (based on the concepts defined in Ontology). The proposed tool SentIndiGov-O proffers a sentiment analysis application model based on ontologies, where the ontology IndiGov-O is created for ""Ministries of Government of India"" to reinforce the feature selection task in a Naïve Bayesian classification paradigm.

Many graph mining approaches have been developed over the years; of which one of the most challenging tasks is frequent subgraph mining (FSM). Most of the existing FSM algorithms consider only the graph-based structure, the importance of entities involved or the strength of their relationships are not considered. Weighted graphs may be better suited for many cases such as social networks, mobile-communication networks, transportation networks etc. Thus there is a need for efficient weighted subgraph mining approaches. Only few methods have been developed for FSM in weighted graphs. In the present big data era, to handle the massive quantity of data generated from various applications, there is a huge demand for distributed computational approaches. Currently, there is no such distributed approach for weighted FSM. In this work, a distributed approach for weighted frequent subgraph mining using MapReduce framework (WFSM-MR) is proposed. The idea is that both data and the computation part, i.e. weighted subgraph mining, should be distributed for efficient processing. The method is used to discover the significant weighted frequent subgraphs from various edge-weighted graph datasets. Experimental results indicate the proposed approach is efficient, scalable, and can handle large graph datasets compared to the existing non distributed weighted FSM task. © 2016 IEEE.",distributed graph algorithm; frequent subgraph mining; MapReduce framework; weighted subgraph,Data mining; Graphic methods; Social networking (online); Computational approach; Distributed approaches; Distributed graph algorithms; Frequent subgraph mining; Mapreduce frameworks; Mobile communication networks; Subgraphs; Weighted frequent sub-graph minings; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

It is one of the major resources for production of energy because of its dependability due to the development of the technology and relatively low cost. Wind energy is converted into electrical energy using rotating blades. Due to environmental conditions and large structure, the blades are subjected to various vibration forces that may cause damage to the blades. This leads to a liability in energy production and turbine shutdown. The downtime can be reduced when the blades are diagnosed continuously using structural health condition monitoring. These are considered as a pattern recognition problem which consists of three phases namely, feature extraction, feature selection, and feature classification. In this study, statistical features were extracted from vibration signals, feature selection was carried out using a J48 decision tree algorithm and feature classification was performed using best-first tree algorithm and functional trees algorithm.

For this mining, a Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) technique is proposed in the existing work, which removes the irrelevant information by retrieving the contents. Also, the Tag-Annotation-Demand (TAD) re-ranking methodology is employed to generate the personalized images. The major disadvantage of these techniques is that it fails to retrieve both the images and web page contents. In order to overcome this issue, this paper focused to integrate the TAD and BAPS techniques for the image and web page content retrieval. There are two important steps are involved in this paper, which includes, server database upload and content extraction from the database.

State-of the-art research revealed that existing space systems succumb to enigmatic software faults leading to critical loss of life and capital. This article presents a novel approach to solve this issue of overlooking software faults by utilizing both features selection and classification techniques to accurately predict software defects in aerospace systems. The main objective was to identify the preeminent feature selection and prediction technique that enhanced the software fault prediction accuracy with the optimal set of features. The investigations affirmed that a novel hybrid feature selection method revealed the most optimal set of predictive features although no particular predictive technique was suitable to predict faults in all space system datasets. Besides, the exploration of data mining techniques in fault prediction on the NASA Lunar space system software data clearly portrayed the improved fault prediction accuracy (~82% to ~98%) with the feature set selected by the proposed Hybrid Feature Selection method. Also, the random sub sampling method revealed an improved mean Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and accuracy ranging from ~0.7 to ~0.9 and ~86% to ~98% respectively. This we believe generates further scope for future investigations on the most contributing space system features for fault prediction thus enabling design of aerospace systems with minimal faults and enhanced performance. © 2017, Zarka Private University.

Existing model of data organization and processing in Hadoop using HDFS and MapReduce are ideally tailored for search and data parallel applications, for which there is no need of data dependency with its neighboring/adjacent data. However, many scientific applications such as image mining, data mining, knowledge data mining, and satellite image processing are dependent on adjacent data for processing and analysis. In this paper, we identify the requirements of the overlapped data organization and propose a two-phase extension to HDFS and MapReduce programming model, called XHAMI, to address them. The extended interfaces are presented as APIs and implemented in the context of image processing application domain. We demonstrated effectiveness of XHAMI through case studies of image processing functions along with the results. Although XHAMI has little overhead in data storage and input/output operations, it greatly enhances the system performance and simplifies the application development process.

However, there remain the challenges of accuracy, simple implementation, robustness and efficiency, which prevent the calculations from being automated and limit their use. Here we present an exact and complete decoupling analysis in which the partition functions of the compared systems decompose into the partition functions of the common and different subsystems. This decoupling analysis is applicable to submolecules with coupled degrees of freedom such as the methyl group and to any potential function (including the typical dihedral potentials), enabling to remove less terms in the transformation which results in a more efficient calculation. Then we show mathematically, in the context of partition function decoupling, that the two compared systems can be simulated separately, eliminating the need to design a composite system. We demonstrate the decoupling analysis and the separate transformations in a relative free energy calculation using MD simulations for a general force field and compare to another calculation and to experimental results. We present a unified soft-core technique that ensures the monotonicity of the numerically integrated function (analytical proof) which is important for the selection of intermediates. We show mathematically that in this soft-core technique the numerically integrated function can be non-steep only when we transform the systems separately, which can simplify the numerical integration. Finally, we show that when the systems have rugged energy landscape they can be equilibrated without introducing another sampling dimension which can also enable to use the simulation results for other free energy calculations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Decoupling partition functions; Free energy; Molecular dynamics; Monotonicity of free energy derivative; Replica exchange,Binding energy; Data mining; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Integration; Molecular dynamics; Binding free energy; Decoupling analysis; Energy derivatives; Free-energy calculations; Numerical integrations; Partition functions; Relative free energy; Replica exchange; Free energy,"Farhi, A.; Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Physics and Astronomy, Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv UniversityIsrael; email: asaffarhi@post.tau.ac.il",,Elsevier B.V.,104655,,CPHCB,,English,Comput Phys Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007016430

Periodic-frequent patterns are an important class of regularities that exist in a database with respect to these two dimensions. Current studies on periodic-frequent pattern mining have focused on discovering full periodic-frequent patterns, i.e., finding all frequent patterns that have exhibited complete cyclic repetitions in a database. However, partial periodic-frequent patterns are more common due to the imperfect nature of real-world. This paper proposes a flexible and generic model to find partial periodic-frequent patterns. A new interesting measure, periodic-ratio, has been introduced to determine the periodic interestingness of a frequent pattern by taking into account its proportion of cyclic repetitions in a database. The proposed patterns do not satisfy the anti-monotonic property. A novel pruning technique has been introduced to reduce the search space effectively. A pattern-growth algorithm to find all partial periodic-frequent patterns has also been presented in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can discover useful information, and the algorithm is efficient. © 2016",Algorithms; Data mining; Knowledge discovery in databases; Partial periodicity; Pattern mining,Algorithms; Data mining; Frequent pattern mining; Knowledge discovery in database; Monotonic properties; Partial periodicity; Pattern mining; Pruning techniques; Time and frequencies; Transactional database; Database systems,"Kiran, R.U.; The University of TokyoJapan; email: uday.rage@gmail.com",,Elsevier Inc.,1641212,,JSSOD,,English,J Syst Software,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002263399

Big data is now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, owing to the fast development of networking, data storage, and data collection capacity. Big data mining is the capability of extracting useful information from these large datasets. Nowadays, the integration of cloud computing with the data mining for the big data mining process is a challenging task. In order to process the huge amount of data, it is necessary to concentrate the improvement on the big data computation. Most of the existing approaches use the MapReduce to compute the big data. The increase in the computational cost and memory consumption are the main drawbacks of the existing approaches. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a similarity-based clustering and optimum cache replacement approach for big data computing applications. The job recovery process is initiated by copying the data in the cloud server and forwarding the data copy for further processing. Then, the job is divided into clusters based on the similarity-based clustering approach. Finally, the cache concept is introduced with the optimum cache replacement algorithm to avoid repeated execution of the jobs by queue management. The proposed approach is compared with the existing Spark and Hadoop approaches. The proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of iteration time, query response time, job completion time, and clustering accuracy. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Intrusion throws a serious risk in the network. Even though many hardening systems are developed against intrusions, conventional approaches like firewalls, virtual private networks, and encryption techniques are not enough to provide network security. Intrusion detection is a cyber security mechanism that plays an important role in securing the network. Detection rate and false alarm rate are the challenging issues to design an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Various data mining techniques are used to implement network intrusion detection. Classification is a supervised learning which predicts the class label in the data set. Single classifier fails to obtain high accuracy. Base classifiers are not capable of detecting the attacks accurately. Ensemble classifier is a combination of base classifiers. Ensemble classifier outperforms base classifiers.

Image segmentation is very difficult step in the processing of the image which aims at extracting the information from image. Clustering is used to segment the image. Clustering algorithms are part of data mining algorithm that groups the data into various number of given clusters. All the data points in one cluster have similar properties based on which they are clustered i.e. each cluster has minimum difference between its points and maximum difference from other cluster data points. The proposed algorithm uses k-mean algorithm and firefly to cluster image pixels into k cluster for segmentation. Since k-mean clustering algorithm is gets trapped in local optima it is optimized using firefly algorithm. Swarm intelligence based algorithms forms the basis of the firefly algorithm which has several application and used to solve optimization problems. Firefly algorithm has been applied in many research and optimization areas. Firefly algorithm and its hybridized version have been used to solve various problems successfully. To apply firefly algorithm to wide areas of problem the firefly algorithm must be modified or integrated with other algorithms. Presently metaheuristic nature of algorithm plays an important role and current optimization algorithm include this nature and are very efficient in solving NP-hard problems. © 2016 IEEE.,Correlation; Firefly; Image Segmentation; K-Means Clustering Algorithm; Optimization,Bioluminescence; Computational complexity; Correlation methods; Data mining; Image processing; Image segmentation; Optimization; Problem solving; Swarm intelligence; Current optimization; Data mining algorithm; Firefly; Firefly algorithms; K-mean algorithms; K-mean clustering algorithm; K-Means clustering algorithm; Optimization problems; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This is due to the increase in the availability of the high volumes of data in various fields. Multiple sensors are being used to extract the data and each sensor gives multiple features. On the other side performance of a classifier depends on the type of features that are used to represent the data. But storing the high dimensional data is a challenge as they occupy more space and also demands more computational resources. In generative models like Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) based classification there is a direct correlation between the number of features used to represent the data and the number of parameters that are to be estimated. This is where the dimensionality reduction would be helpful. This paper aims to demonstrate the performance of different classifiers in the reduced subspace. Based on the literature it has been observed that non-linear projection is helpful for classification than linear projection of the data. The major objective of this paper is to show the performance of different classifiers in the reduced space after linear and non-linear projection of the data. To reduce dimensionality PCA, KPCA and Auto encoder based techniques are used and to compare the performance in original and reduced space, Classification models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers are used. © 2016 IEEE.",Gaussian mixture models (GMM); Kernel PCA (KPCA); Linear projection; Non-linear projection; Principal component analysis (PCA); Support vector machine (SVM),Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Data mining; Deep neural networks; Gaussian distribution; Image retrieval; Neural networks; Object recognition; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Vectors; Classification models; Computational resources; Dimensionality reduction; Gaussian Mixture Model; High dimensional data; Kernel PCA; Linear projections; Nonlinear projections; Data reduction,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Three benchmarked datasets (Cleveland, Pima and Wisconsin) from the UCI machine learning repository were used to analyze effectiveness of the proposed model. The obtained results clearly shows that the modified ant-miner outperforms the other top data mining classification algorithms like the CN2, RBF, Adaboost and Bagging in terms of accuracy.

We are living in an era of data deluge and as a result, the term 'Big Data' is appearing in many contexts. It ranges from meteorology, genomics, complex physics simulations, biological and environmental research, finance and business to healthcare. Big Data refers to data streams of higher velocity and higher variety. The infrastructure required to support the acquisition of Big Data must deliver low, predictable latency in both capturing data and in executing short, simple queries. To be able to handle very high transaction volumes, often in a distributed environment; and support flexible, dynamic data structures. Data processing is considerably more challenging than simply locating, identifying, understanding, and citing data. For effective large-scale analysis all of this has to happen in a completely automated manner. This requires differences in data structure and semantics to be expressed in forms that are computer understandable, and then 'robotically' resolvable. There is a strong body of work in data integration, mapping and transformations. However, considerable additional work is required to achieve automated error-free difference resolution.

These large data sets are now called Big Data. Working with Big Data is not a common task. As this large data set has information hidden within them, researchers cannot and they have not ignored the large data set. Data mining is an interdisciplinary field in Computer Science which extracts information or the hidden patterns from data. Association rule mining and frequent itemset mining are popular data mining techniques that requires entire data to be in main memory. But large datasets does not fit into main memory. To handle this drawback, Hadoop MapReduce approach is used which has scalability and robustness features to handle large datasets. Apriori, Eclat and FP Growth are well known Frequent Itemset Mining algorithms. These algorithms are revised to work with Big Data using Hadoop MapReduce. But MapReduce framework has problems such as it stores the intermediate data in local disk. So the data needs to be accessed from the local disk which results in high latency problem. To address this issue Spark follows a general execution model that helps in in-memory computing and optimization of arbitrary operator graphs so that querying data becomes much faster when compared to the disk based engines like MapReduce. Thus the paper focuses on enhancing the performance of Frequent Itemset Mining using Apache Spark architecture and study the performance of this Revamped Market Basket Analysis based on FP-Growth by comparing it with Hadoop MapReduce implementation of Frequent Itemset Mining task, BigFIM and also with different datasets. © 2017 IEEE.",Apache Spark; Frequent Itemset Mining; Hadoop MapReduce,Commerce; Data mining; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Remote sensing; Wireless sensor networks; Arbitrary operators; Frequent itemset mining; Hadoop MapReduce; Hidden patterns; Interdisciplinary fields; Mapreduce frameworks; Market basket analysis; Memory computations; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

These data mining techniques are considered to be the crucial in microarray data analysis. These kinds of data analysis always put focus to the ideal functions of genes and transcription factor target relationships. However by applying traditional clustering methods, a set of genes with its similar expressions can be determined. But these methods usually fail to find more correlated patterns that are present in the microarray data which can be achieved by using biclustering techniques. Here we propose a novel biclustering algorithm that not only determines the co-related gene expression patterns in microarray data along but also provides an effective strategy to control the overlapping in biclusters. © 2016 IEEE.",Biclustering; Overlapping Control Strategy; Pattern Scaling; Pattern Shifting; POP,Data handling; Data mining; Genes; Information analysis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Transcription; Bi-clustering; Biclustering algorithm; Gene expression patterns; Microarray data analysis; Overlapping control; Pattern Scaling; Pattern Shifting; Traditional clustering; Gene expression,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Towards sentiment analysis for most of the popular websites like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter necessitate the review of the customers which are used as a feedback. It's play very important role for product review, Business intelligence as well as in decision making. The main problem that arises to the point of view of users/customers is that, it is practically in-feasible to read all those online reviews one by one, because some of the products might have tens of thousand reviews. In this paper, reviews are collected from the sources like Amazon, Flipkart, and then used a method to combine both NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning approach. Word sense disambiguation is also considered for this study. An improvised lesk algorithms is used for removing noise in the data. Different types of data have different types of properties and therefore are suited to different techniques correspondingly. This problem is closely related to the large scale nature of social networks and the necessity to perform aggregation operations, which results in the form of Pie-Chart.

Smart air pollution monitoring consists of wireless sensor nodes, server and a database to store the monitored data. Huge amounts of data are generated by gas sensors in air pollution monitoring system. Traditional methods are too complex to process and analyze the voluminous data. The heterogeneous data are converted into meaningful information by using data mining approaches for decision making. The K-Means algorithm is one of the frequently used clustering method in data mining for clustering massive data sets. In this paper, enhanced K-Means clustering algorithm is proposed to analyze the air pollution data. The correlation coefficient is calculated from the real time monitored pollutant datasets. The Air Quality Index (AQI) value is calculated from the correlation co-efficient to determine the air pollution level in a particular place. The proposed enhanced K-Means clustering algorithm is compared with Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) clustering algorithm in terms of accuracy and execution time. Experimental results show that the proposed enhanced K-Means clustering algorithm gives AQI value in higher accuracy with less execution time for when compared to existing techniques. © 2016 IEEE.",Air Pollution; Analysis; AQI; Enhanced K-Means Clustering; PFCM,Air pollution; Air quality; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Decision making; Pollution; Pollution detection; Sensor nodes; Air pollution monitoring; Air quality indices; Analysis; Correlation coefficient; K-means clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; PFCM; Wireless sensor node; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9.78151E+12,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015455176

Traditional similarity measures lose their meaning as the number of dimensions increases and as a consequence, distance or density based clustering algorithms become less meaningful. Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) is a solution to clustering high-dimensional data with the ability to find clusters of varying density. SNN assigns objects to a cluster, which share a large number of their nearest neighbors. However, SNN is compute and memory intensive for data of large size and/or dimensionality. Nearest neighbor queries are responsible for a major proportion of computations in SNN, resulting in lower efficiency for higher value of number of nearest neighbors (k). The main motivation of this work is to improve the efficiency of SNN and to parallelize it so that it can be used for clustering large high-dimensional datasets and for large values of k. Existing SNN algorithms become inefficient in these situations. In this paper, we present a new sequential SNN algorithm, R-SNN, which uses R-tree for executing neighborhood queries efficiently and exploiting spatial locality to minimize memory usage. R-SNN is benchmarked against the best available implementation of SNN and is found up to 77 times faster when tested on various real datasets. R-SNN is parallelized for distributed memory, shared memory, and hybrid systems. Significant speedup and scalability achieved can be attributed to parallelization and good load balancing strategies and also to exploitation of spatial locality. Experimental results demonstrate the same for datasets of varying dimensionality and size. The maximum speedup achieved for shared, distributed, and hybrid models are 427.19 using 48 threads, 394.24 using 32 processes, and 1380.69 on 32 nodes (with each node spawning 4 threads), respectively. Super-linear speedup for some datasets is attributed to optimized neighborhood queries. All the proposed algorithms produce identical clustering results as that of the classical SNN. © 2016 IEEE.",clustering; data mining; high-dimensional data; Parallel algorithm; shared nearest neighbor,Data mining; Decision trees; Efficiency; Hybrid systems; Memory architecture; Nearest neighbor search; Parallel algorithms; Trees (mathematics); clustering; Density-based clustering algorithms; High dimensional data; High dimensional datasets; Load balancing strategy; Nearest neighbor queries; Neighborhood queries; Shared nearest neighbors; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Existing rule-based classification systems have been widely used for diabetes diagnosis, even though they must overcome the challenge of producing a comprehensive optimal ruleset while balancing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values. To resolve this drawback, in this paper, a Spider Monkey Optimization-based rule miner (SM-RuleMiner) has been proposed for diabetes classification. A novel fitness function has also been incorporated into SM-RuleMiner to generate a comprehensive optimal ruleset while balancing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed rule-miner is compared against three rule-based algorithms, namely ID3, C4.5 and CART, along with several meta-heuristic-based rule mining algorithms, on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using 10-fold cross validation. It has been observed that the proposed rule miner outperforms several well-known algorithms in terms of average classification accuracy and average sensitivity.

Most of the real-world networks are heterogeneous in their natural setting and traditional methods of classification for homogeneous networks are not suitable for heterogeneous networks. In a heterogeneous network, various meta-paths connecting objects of the target type, on which classification is to be performed, make the classification task more challenging. The semantic of each meta-path would lead to the different accuracy of classification. Therefore, weight learning of meta-paths is required to leverage their semantics simultaneously by a weighted combination. In this work, we propose a novel meta-path based framework, HeteClass, for transductive classification of target type objects. HeteClass explores the network schema of the given network and can also incorporate the knowledge of the domain expert to generate a set of meta-paths. The regularization based weight learning method proposed in HeteClass is effective to compute the weights of symmetric as well as asymmetric meta-paths in the network, and the weights generated are consistent with the real-world understanding. Using the learned weights, a homogeneous information network is formed on target type objects by the weighted combination, and transductive classification is performed. The proposed framework HeteClass is flexible to utilize any suitable classification algorithm for transductive classification and can be applied on heterogeneous information networks with arbitrary network schema. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the HeteClass for classification of unlabeled objects in heterogeneous information networks using real-world data sets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Heterogeneous information network; Meta-path; Transductive classification; Weight learning,Data mining; Heterogeneous networks; Information services; Semantics; Virtual reality; Accuracy of classifications; Classification algorithm; Classification tasks; Heterogeneous information; Information networks; Knowledge extraction; Meta-path; Weight learning; Classification (of information),"Gupta, M.; Indian Institute of Management LucknowIndia; email: fpm13008@iiml.ac.in",,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992109573

To get rid of this the most popular and useful approach is to follow reviews of others in opinionated social medias, who have already tried them. Almost all e-commerce sites provide facility to the users for giving views and experience of the product and services they experienced. The customers reviews are increasingly used by individuals, manufacturers and retailers for purchase and business decisions. As there is no scrutiny over the reviews received, anybody can write anything unanimously which conclusively leads to review spam. Moreover, driven by the desire of profit and/or publicity, spammers produce synthesized reviews to promote some products/brand and demote competitors products/brand. Deceptive review spam has seen a considerable growth overtime. In this work, we have applied supervised as well as unsupervised techniques to identify review spam. Most effective feature sets have been assembled for model building. Sentiment analysis has also been incorporated in the detection process. In order to get best performance some well-known classifiers were applied on labeled dataset. Further, for the unlabeled data, clustering is used after desired attributes were computed for spam detection. Additionally, there is a high chance that spam reviewers may also be held responsible for content pollution in multimedia social networks, because nowadays many users are giving the reviews using their social network logins. Finally, the work can be extended to find suspicious accounts responsible for posting fake multimedia contents into respective social networks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Opinion spam; Review analysis; Review spam; Sentiment analysis; Social networking; Spam detection techniques,Classification (of information); Commerce; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Sales; Social networking (online); Labeled and unlabeled data; Opinion spam; Product and services; Products and services; Review spam; Sentiment analysis; Spam detection; Unsupervised techniques; Internet,"Bakshi, S.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: sambitbaksi@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982291336

The agent achieves this with the help of a fuzzy rule base working on a variety of learning materials and recommending the appropriate learning path through them. In a learner-centric environment the learning behaviour of a learner may vary to a great extent due to the characteristics of the learner and his environment. Students are often misled while choosing the appropriate path of web learning tools owing to non-availability of a human teacher/guide. By the response of a learner to different positive and negative motivation factors the proposed system employs a fuzzy machine that is fed with realization parameters e.g. Satisfied, Depressed etc. The fuzzy machine working on the paradigm of fuzzy inference system processes these realization parameters with the help of a fuzzy rule base to produce the crisp measures of the learner's cognitive states in terms of Belief, Behaviour and Attitude. On the basis of these defuzzified crisp diagnostic parameters the proposed system will enhanced the quality of learning experience of an e-learner. To ensure this the system will provide more detailed discussion on the subject matter along with some additional learning tools. Learners often get confused to select the proper tools among various. Therefore the proposed system will also suggest most popular path among those learners with the same understanding. This recommendation comes from the analysis of data mining result. The system was tested with a wide variety of school-level students. The response obtained indicates that it is able to enhance the quality of learning experience through its recommendation. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Fuzzy rule based; intelligent agent; online recommendation; realization modelling; self-paced learner,Data mining; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Intelligent agents; Teaching; Diagnostic parameter; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy rule based; Learning materials; Learning objectives; online recommendation; Quality of learning; self-paced learner; Learning systems,,,World Scientific Publishing Co.

The DT used the entropy function to convert the given problem into a tree structured format / set of rules. The SS provides an extensive investigation of the search space through diversification. The advantages of both DT and SS are used to form a hybrid approach. The proposed algorithm is tested with various benchmark datasets available for flowshop scheduling.

Analysis performed on 'dirty' data may lead to erroneous insights and thereby shaping decisions poorly. The aspect of big data that deals with its correctness is known as big data veracity. Trusting the data acquired goes a long way in implementing decisions from an automated decision-making system and veracity helps to validate the data acquired. In this paper, we present our solution to the big data veracity problem using crowdsourcing techniques. Our solution involves the use of sentiment analysis, which deals with identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. As a proof of concept, we have developed an app that requires users to tag tweets as per the sentiment it evokes in them. Each tweet would therefore get ratified by hundreds of our participants and the sentiment associated to the tweet gets tagged. The tagged emotion was then evaluated against the verified emotion as compared to a verified data set. This analysis was then plotted on a ROC curve and also evaluated against verified data using a Bayesian predictor trained with a trinomial function. As can be seen, an accuracy of 81% was obtained as displayed by the ROC curve and 89% through the Bayesian predictor. Also, a MAP analysis of the Bayesian predictor yields neutral sentiment as the most probable hypothesis. By doing this, we have proven that crowdsourcing of sentiment analysis is a viable solution to the problem of big data veracity and therefore an aid in making better decisions. © 2016 IEEE.",Bayesian predictor; Big data; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Tweet mining,Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Data mining; Decision making; Learning systems; Automated decision making systems; Bayesian; Map analysis; Proof of concept; ROC curves; Sentiment analysis; Tweet minings; Viable solutions; Big data,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Manpower working in industries is mostly semi-skilled. Production output, its quality and cost are affected by energy wastage and device failure causing downtimes resulting from electrical faults and erroneuos operations. Such abnormality must be detected and reported proactively to the facility manager, who can act to avoid major losses. This paper describes the concept of detecting electrical and operational abnormality (anomaly) of loads through observing changes in electrical parameters collected by installation of energy meters. The paper proposes classification of anomalies based on their origin. Further, essential feature sets required for accurate detection of anomalies are described. To verify the concept, load data is collected from a pilot small scale manufacturing facility by installing energy meters at different load points in process lines. After preprocessing the raw data, necessary features are extracted and are subjected to classification algorithms for detecting possible anomalies. Results for two loads at test site are presented with comparison of support vector data descriptor and support vector machine algorithms for classification as normal or anomalous. © 2016 IEEE.",,Electric measuring instruments; Energy efficiency; Feature extraction; Flowmeters; Manufacture; Classification algorithm; Electrical parameter; Energy-intensive manufacturing industries; Manufacturing facility; Manufacturing sector; Production outputs; Support vector data; Support vector machine algorithm; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

Hyperspectral imaging collects information in the form of several hundreds of spectral bands with narrow bandwidths and provides full spectral information regarding the data. Hyperspectral image classification has been a vital topic which is growing rapidly in the field of research. Several applications can be built by making proper use of this data, i.e. from the abundance of spatial and spectral information which provides strong binding to build new ideas and new algorithm. Few approaches have concluded that the linear features directly extracted from hyperspectral data for classification provides distinct classification output and few other approaches conclude that the features selected using nonlinear features help to diminish dimensionality of the data, for better modelling of the intrinsic nonlinearity of classification. By combining the spectral features extracted using Root Mean Square (RMS) feature extraction technique and spatial features extracted using Extended Multi-Attribute Profile (EMAP) feature extraction technique we can get better classification output compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm utilizes both linear and nonlinear features along with a Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression (SMLR) classifier to provide a better classification.

Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent case now and it mostly affects the elderly people. The disease condition makes a person lose his memory and have trouble in doing his day-to-day activities, and progressively the condition leads to death. No treatment is available to completely cure the disease but it would be beneficial if the disease is detected earlier as the necessary aid can be provided. The proposed algorithm uses Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment non-convertible (MCInc) and Mild Cognitive Impairment convertible (MCIc) data from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and it involves the process of pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. MCIc leads to Alzheimer's disease at a later stage. A combination of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for the feature extraction and further subjected to classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The multiple feature extractions with both the DWT and the PCA together give a better accuracy during classification compared to other algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",Alzheimer's disease (AD); Discrete Wavelet transform(DWT); Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR); Mild Cognitive Impairment(MCI); Principal Component Analysis(PCA); Support Vector Machine(SVM),Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Data mining; Discrete wavelet transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Alzheimer's disease; Elderly people; Feature extraction and classification; Fisher discriminant; Mild cognitive impairments; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Pre-processing; Robust algorithm; Principal component analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

In such a scenario, automatic detection of activities that they are involved in has many potential uses, and even presenting users with a summary of their current set of activities was found to be of value in itself. In this paper, we describe the problem of automatically detecting user activities from e-mails, while using only meta-data of e-mails, i.e., we do not process email contents. We present a novel two stage algorithm for automatic activity detection from users' e-mails: We first represent the e-mail dataset as a rectangular matrix using features such as other e-mails, people involved, and names of the documents attached in the e-mails. We next represent the emails in latent feature space using SVD, followed by further dimensionality reduction using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor embedding(t-SNE). We then cluster e-mails using density based clustering algorithm in t-SNE space. In the second stage we merge these clusters based on group properties and a community detection algorithm on the graph of clusters, to yield our set of automatically detected activities. We analyse public e-mail datasets and present benchmarks of our approach on real-life datasets collected from our target users, and also compare our algorithm with alternative approaches as well as those published in recent literature. © 2016 IEEE.",Activity Detection; Bayesian Optimization; Email Clustering; Singular Value Decomposition; T-SNE,Data mining; Electronic mail; Metadata; Optimization; Singular value decomposition; Stochastic systems; Activity detection; Bayesian optimization; Community detection algorithms; Density-based clustering algorithms; Dimensionality reduction; Information workers; Stochastic neighbor embedding; T-SNE; Clustering algorithms,,Baeza-Yates R.Gullo F.Domeniconi C.Bonchi F.Domingo-Ferrer J.Baeza-Yates R.Wu X.Baeza-Yates R.Bonchi F.Zhou Z.-H.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Given a series of snapshots of a temporal heterogeneous graph, we aim to find interesting projections of the graph which have anomalous evolutionary behavior. Detecting anomalous projections in a series of such snapshots can be helpful for an analyst to understand the regions of interest from the temporal graph. Identifying such semantically related regions in the graph allows the analyst to derive insights from temporal graphs which enables her in making decisions. While most of the work on temporal outlier detection is performed on nodes, subgraphs and communities, we are the first to propose detection of evolutionary graph cuboid outliers. Further, we perform this detection in a query sensitive manner. Thus, an evolutionary graph cuboid outlier is a projection (or cuboid) of a snapshot of the temporal graph such that it contains an unexpected number of matches for the query with respect to other cuboids both in the same snapshot as well as in the other snapshots. Identifying such outliers is challenging because (1) the number of cuboids per snapshot could be large, and (2) number of snapshots could itself be large. We model the problem by predicting the outlier score for each cuboid in each snapshot. We propose to build subspace ensemble regression models to learn (a) the behavior of a cuboid across different snapshots, and (b) the behavior of all the cuboids in a given snapshot. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in discovering evolutionary graph cuboid outliers. © 2016 IEEE.",Evolutionary Graph Cuboid Outliers; Graph Projection Outliers; Information Networks; Outlier Detection,Data handling; Information services; Regression analysis; Statistics; Evolutionary Graph Cuboid Outliers; Graph Projection Outliers; Heterogeneous graph; Information networks; Multiple dimensions; Outlier Detection; Regions of interest; Regression model; Data mining,,Baeza-Yates R.Gullo F.Domeniconi C.Bonchi F.Domingo-Ferrer J.Baeza-Yates R.Wu X.Baeza-Yates R.Bonchi F.Zhou Z.-H.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Often such analyses are specific to the domain and analysts are required to devise new algorithms or techniques. For such scenarios, providing a high-level programming environment that delivers high performance on clusters is a challenge. We propose a framework that supports high-level programming using domain abstractions in data mining while delivering scalable performance on commodity clusters i.e. clusters of multi-core workstations. This framework includes a domain specific programming language, DWARF, to enable data mining specialists to rapidly prototype algorithms. DWARF is supported by a compiler that automatically parallelizes code by identifying domain specific patterns and translating them to parallel code that exploits data parallelism and task parallelism. The compiler generates code for a hybrid virtual machine supporting distributed memory model at the top level and shared memory model nested within. The code generated by the compiler can be scheduled on commodity clusters.

RHC discovery is important to many fields like transportation engineering, criminology, and epidemiology. Designing a scalable algorithm for RHC discovery is challenging mainly because of non-monotonicity of popular spatial statistical interest measures of association between events, one such measure being the cross-K function. This challenge makes Apriori-based pruning algorithms inapplicable. The large enumeration space is another challenge. To address these limitations, we propose a cross-K inspired interest measure and using that, a novel algorithm for RHC discovery.

We extract 2.7 million Brexit related tweets to decipher the European Union (EU) referendum deliberations. Our volumetric analysis correctly predicts the outcome of 2016 Brexit referendum. We also investigate whether Twitter discussion adequately reflects the socio-economic concerns related to the UK's decision to leave or remain in the EU. We consider hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) to explore various underlying themes of this political discourse. To tackle a large portion of retweets in our corpus, we employ tanglegram framework to graphically compare HCA of unique tweets (after removing the duplicates tweets) and the entire corpus. We note finer variances between these two HCA. © 2016 IEEE.",Brexit referendum; Hierarchical clustering; Tanglegram; Twitter,Data mining; Volumetric analysis; Brexit referendum; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical clustering analysis; Micro-blogging platforms; Political discourse; Political movements; Tanglegram; Twitter; Social networking (online),,Baeza-Yates R.Gullo F.Domeniconi C.Bonchi F.Domingo-Ferrer J.Baeza-Yates R.Wu X.Baeza-Yates R.Bonchi F.Zhou Z.-H.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In contrast to other forms of media, such as newspaper, the text in these social media posts usually contains fewer words, and is concentrated on a much narrower selection of topics. For these reasons, traditional LDA-based sentiment and topic modeling techniques generally do not work well in case of social media data. Another characteristic feature of this data is the use of special meta tokens, such as hashtags, which contain unique semantic meanings that are not captured by other ordinary words. In the recent years, many topic modeling techniques have been proposed for social media data, but the majority of this work does not take into account the specialty of tokens, such as hashtags, and treats them as ordinary words. In this paper, we propose probabilistic graphical models to address the problem of discovering latent topics and their sentiment from social media data, mainly microblogs like Twitter. We first propose MTM (Microblog Topic Model), a generative model that assumes each social media post generates from a single topic, and models both words and hashtags separately. We then propose MSTM (Microblog Sentiment Topic Model), an extension of MTM, which also embodies the sentiment associated with the topics. We evaluated our models using Twitter dataset, and experimental results show that our models outperform the existing techniques. © 2016 IEEE.",Probabilistic Graphical Models; Sentiment Analysis; Topic Modeling,Contrast media; Data mining; Graphic methods; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Generative model; Micro-blog; Microblogs; Probabilistic graphical models; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social media datum; Topic Modeling; Social networking (online),,Baeza-Yates R.Gullo F.Domeniconi C.Bonchi F.Domingo-Ferrer J.Baeza-Yates R.Wu X.Baeza-Yates R.Bonchi F.Zhou Z.-H.,IEEE Computer Society,23759232,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The brain serves to control and coordinate the mental and physical actions. It has the capacity to store innumerable data. This data includes not only childhood memories but also those related to the present age. Tracking the electrical potentials or impulses, commonly known as brain waves, can be utilized for various purposes ranging from diagnosing diseases to decoding personality traits. This can be done using the technique of Electroencephalography (EEG). The amount of data available is exploding so also the opportunities of data mining thereby mounting privacy risks. The current practice either prevents the reuse of raw EEG signals or disrespects participants' right to privacy by using this data for purposes other than those consented to, by the individual. The aim of this work is to put a stop to such privacy risks by extracting and transferring only those features related to an application. Feature is a specific characteristic measurement of a pattern segment. EEG signal processing pertains mainly to feature extraction. There are different methods for extracting features from EEG signals. In this work, the features related to neurological diseases, namely epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, are extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and those related to Schizophrenia are extracted using Autoregressive (AR) method. For securing the raw data, it is doubly encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and is kept under the control of each user. The proposed system thus ensures the privacy of an individual's EEG signals, and mitigates any risk that may arise if raw data is made available as such to the public. © 2016 IEEE.",Brain waves; Electroencephalography (EEG); Encryption; Feature extraction; Privacy,Biomedical signal processing; Data mining; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurology; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms; Application specific; Autoregressive methods; Brain wave; Characteristic measurements; EEG signal processing; Electrical potential; Neurological disease; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

When the data of the individuals is stored by the third party it leads to the insecurity of misuse of their information in the individuals. Data Mining is carried on this data stored over cloud to get useful information, analysis and decision making purposes. But along with the process of mining, privacy preservation is the key concern. While performing data mining over large set of data there are chances of privacy violation, loss of information, loss of privacy of individuals. While concentrating only on preserving privacy can increase inefficiency and complexity of data mining techniques. Techniques used for achieving privacy lead to a significant information loss. The methods concerned about information loss generally lack behind in achieving a good level of privacy. Thus it is important to find the efficient data mining technique which can preserve privacy without causing high loss of information. This paper analyses various privacy preserving data mining techniques for their pros and cons and then gives a proposed concept to achieve privacy with minimum information loss.",Anonymization; Information loss; Perturbation; Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Randomization,Data privacy; Decision making; Anonymization; Information loss; Perturbation; Privacy preserving data mining; Randomization; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

A high dimensional data consists of several features or attributes. These data may contain redundant and irrelevant features. The curse of dimensionality is an important problem in data mining and machine learning. In order to reduce the dimensionality of data and to improve the classifier performance, the unwanted and redundant features need to be removed. Feature selection techniques are used to identify the redundant and irrelevant features from the original set of data. Feature selection is the process of identifying most representative features from a collection of features. Existing feature selection algorithms like FAST, reduces dimensionality by removing irrelevant and redundant features from a collection of data and selects the required subset of features. The FAST algorithm uses information gain to calculate the symmetric uncertainty which is used as the measure of correlation between features. Information gain will check for only the presence of a feature with respect to another feature or class. But this will not give an accurate result. Thus the accuracy of results produced from the FAST algorithm is low. So a new Binary Krill Herd (BKH) algorithm is introduced for feature selection, in which a classifier is used as the objective function. BKH is a biological algorithm based on the movement of krill individuals. A binary vector is used to determine whether or not a feature will be selected, where 1 denotes whether a feature will be selected and 0 otherwise. The algorithm is evaluated a number of times with respect to the changes in the number of iterations per run, population size, problem dimension, and number of runs. The Binary Krill Herd algorithm not only considers the presence but also the change of a feature with respect to another or class. This helps to identify strongly correlated features compared to FAST algorithm. The proposed BKH algorithm has been compared against with FAST algorithm using several datasets. The datasets are derived from UCI machine learning repository. For the validation of the new algorithm, the classification accuracy is tested against several classifiers, mainly J48, Naive Bayes, Decision tree etc. The experimental result shows that the BKH algorithm for feature selection achieves more reduction in dimensionality by selecting only a small portion of the original features and outperforms FAST algorithms by producing more accurate results in less time. © 2016 IEEE.",Dimensionality reduction; Feature clustering; Feature subset selection; Krill; Symmetric uncertainty,Artificial intelligence; Bins; Bioinformatics; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Population statistics; Trees (mathematics); Dimensionality reduction; Feature clustering; Feature subset selection; Krill; Symmetric uncertainty; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

As a result, the database is not only utilized for mere information retrieval but also to infer the analytical aspect of data. Therefore it is essential to find association rules from high dimensional data because the correlation amongst the attributes can help in gaining deeper insight into the data and help in decision making, recommendations as well as reorganizing the data for effective retrieval.

These tweets can be effectively used for extracting mood of a person.Extraction of mood from texts is a challenging task as it involves understanding the underlying semantic. In this paper a new approach is been proposed that uses lexicon database to assign each word in a text a value called as 'Impact Factor'. The Impact Factor is nothing but how a single word is affecting the whole sentence in which it is used. Every word in a sentence has its own Impact Factor and it tries to influence the overall semantic of the sentence. Higher the value of Impact Factor of a word in the sentence, the more influential it is. The approach proposed in this paper makes use of lexicon based approach as well as machine based learning.

Additionally to make decisions the attributes of all the departments are required. But the departments are not able to disclose the privacy of data owner. Therefore to combine the data attributes and mining of the combined data need a privacy preserving technique for preventing the privacy issues in a centralize database. In this paper we demonstrate how the different departments of same organization combine their data without harming the privacy of the client for making effective decisions in efficient and accurate manner. Thus the method vertically data combination, cryptography and decision mining is demonstrated. To mine the decisions from the data a C4.5 decision tree is used.

One such application is in the field of politics, where political entities need to understand public opinion and thus determine their campaigning strategy. Sentiment analysis on social media data has been seen by many as an effective tool to monitor user preferences and inclination. Popular text classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM are Supervised Learning Algorithms which require a training data set to perform Sentiment analysis. The accuracy of these algorithms is contingent upon the quantity as well as the quality (features and contextual relevance) of the labeled training data. Since most applications suffer from lack of training data, they resort to cross domain sentiment analysis which misses out on features relevant to the target data. This, in turn, takes a toll on the overall accuracy of text classification. In this paper, we propose a two stage framework which can be used to create a training data from the mined Twitter data without compromising on features and contextual relevance. Finally, we propose a scalable machine learning model to predict the election results using our two stage framework.",Labeling; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Training data; Twitter; Vader,Data mining; Labeling; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Text processing; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Training data; Twitter; Vader; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This information can be used in various constructive fields only if we are able to handle big data efficiently. One such process that is used to extract and handle the hidden information is data mining. There are various techniques in data mining namely Clustering, Prediction, Classification, Association etc. Clustering is dividing data set into related groups such that all the groups do not have anything in common. Prediction, as the name suggests, predictions are made with available data set. It does not give surety of any kind, it may predict right or may predict wrong. Classification is classification of data sets into some predefined sets using various mathematical models. Association is discovering a correlation hidden in large amount of data, that is, in a given transaction based on the relationships between the items a pattern is discovered. In this paper we study one of the most widely used methods to handle big data, that is, data mining clustering algorithms.

In this paper, firefly and GSO algorithm is efficiently combined to pick the appropriate features from the big dimensional area using correlation. Once the finest feature space is determined through FSO algorithm, the E-mail classification is accomplished using weighted based majority voting system.

Entity Identification is one of the most important problems in data cleaning and arises in many applications such as information integration and information retrieval. One of the challenges is entity resolution, when integrating data from different sources. As the volume of data on the web or in databases increases, data integration is becoming more expensive and challenging than ever before. For example, different persons may have identical name or other characteristics. So it is necessary to identify such complex records referring to same real world entity. Traditional entity identification approaches obtain a result using similarity comparison among records, assuming that records referring to the same entity are more similar to each other. However, such property may not hold so traditional ER approaches can't identify records correctly in some cases. The proposed framework develops a class of ER rules which are used for entity identification capable to identify the complex matching conditions between records and entities. By incorporating decision tree concept into the rule generation algorithm the proposed framework outperforms the traditional method. In the proposed method, by applying rules to each record, it is possible to identify which entity the record refers to. © 2016 IEEE.",Entity resolution; length threshold; rules,Complex networks; Data mining; Decision trees; Trees (mathematics); Entity identification; Entity resolutions; Information integration; length threshold; Matching condition; Real-world entities; Rule generation; rules; Data integration,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, we put forward a technique to provide privacy preservation of sensitive data based on the semantic context. Our approach encapsulates various techniques of Text-processing, keyphrase extraction, Cooccurrence analysis, ontology construction and query analysis. To handle privacy issues Correlation Based Transformation Strategy (CBTS) is performed on sensitive data, additionally we can add custom properties to the attributes of the ontology to indicate the sensitive data. Our experimental results indicate that our solution is effective in marking the private data using the semantic context of the input text.

While dealing with uncertain data U-Apriori, UF-growth, UFP-growth, UH-mine, PUF-growth, TPC-growth algorithm are examples of existing frequent pattern mining algorithms, which utilize different approaches to mine frequent pattern. One important observation is that algorithms behave completely different in the uncertain database as compared to the precise database due of the inclusion of probability value.

The analysis is represented in the form of comparative study of following algorithm: U-Apriori, UF-growth, UFP-growth, UH-mine, and PUF-growth, TPC-growth algorithm on the basis on various parameters such as database scan, running time, memory utilization and storage structure.

It defines any injury caused by taking a drug or overdose of drug or due to combination of two or more drugs. Detection of adverse drug reactions is necessary because they affect a large number of people and can help in raising early warning against adverse effects of drugs and help medical practitioners in making treatment effective and timely. In today's digital era a huge amount of data related to adverse effects of drugs is being collected at hospitals, drug retail stores and by drug manufacturers. This data can be utilized for finding out the hidden relationships between drugs and their adverse reactions. But due to the vast amount of data it is not possible to analyze it manually. Data mining is the process of extracting meaningful and useful patterns hidden in large amounts of data. Data mining techniques can be availed in the medical domain for extracting the relationships between drugs and adverse reactions. These techniques help in saving cost as opposed to experimental detection of drugs and adverse reaction relationships.

In this paper an effort has been made to not only examine the past and present transaction database to discover customer purchasing behavior but also to find the strength of association relation between the data items. Association rule is used to find the rules from the past transaction data, but as the time goes on and the environment or customer choice changes, association rules of past transaction data items might become obsolete. Hence rules should be checked regularly and categories according to the strength of measures. In this paper, a new algorithms 'Improved Pseudo-association Rules' (abbreviated IPAR)is proposed, which finds the strength of the relations between the data items. The advantage of this proposed algorithm is that it finds the strength of the association rules and also categories it into Unreasonable, Reasonable and Strong subset in less time. This categorization can help to understand which association rule has more happening or which has less happening. The experimental result shows that the association rule generated by present algorithm has reasonably lesser execution time and strength of the relationships. It also shows the trend of association rules of each category. © 2016 IEEE.",Apriori Algorithm; Association Rules mining; Confidence; Pseudo-association Rules; Support,Data mining; Sales; Supports; Apriori algorithms; Association rules mining; Confidence; Data mining methods; Past and present; Purchasing behaviors; Transaction data; Transaction database; Association rules,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Clique-based formulation of this problem employing maximum flow implementation turns out to be an optimization task limiting the solution to be an approximate one. On the other hand, an iterative method building the hotspots (dense sub-graphs) in an incremental manner starting from primitive graph entities looks more practical and more conducive to incorporating application specific characteristics of interest. Motivated by this idea, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting dense sub-graphs based on spectral graph theory. The underlying principle is that the largest eigenvalue of a graph is a numerical indicator of the inherent dense connectivity. Accordingly, our algorithm starts from the egonets (sub-graphs) of individual nodes and determines the dense egonets as the primitive entities based on their eigenvalues. It then discovers hotspots (dense sub-graphs) through iterative merging of the dense egonets in a controlled manner. Experimental evaluation on benchmark graph data sets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.",Data mining; Dense sub-graphs; Graph mining; Hotspots; Network data; Spectral graph theory,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Data mining; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Graphic methods; Iterative methods; Optimization; Dense sub-graphs; Graph mining; Hotspots; Network data; Spectral graph theory; Graph theory,,Maulik U.Gao X.-Z.Bhattacharyya S.Dutta H.S.Majumdar D.Pan I.Bhattacharjee D.Mondal A.Bhaumik H.Bhaumik A.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

To communicate with other users and share their thoughts and opinions, online users' tend to use texts in the form of blogs, posts, tweets, messages, reviews, comments etc. Thus, there has been an immense possibility complemented with a wide gamut of research in the field of Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis by using textual information from online communities. Hence, there is an extensive need for different text classification algorithms and approaches to classify texts and predict sentiments correctly so as to comprehend the emotional state of the user. We have varied algorithms for text classification for predicting emotional traits. In this paper, we are proposing a novel dictionary-based algorithm that uses lexicon-based approach for opinion mining and calculates the sentiment polarity levels. Our algorithm is different from other lexicon-based algorithms in the context that it uses the three degrees of comparisons viz. positive, comparative and superlative degrees on words; for each of the positive and negative sentiment words.

Ranking is an important application of web mining which is based on the structure, content and usage. Many algorithms exist for web page ranking and these algorithms are based upon one or more parameters such as forward links, backward links, contents and user interaction time. The efficiency of an algorithm may be based upon the parameters that are applied to determine the ranking of the page. In this paper some important page ranking algorithms are discussed and a new page ranking algorithm is proposed named as User Preference Based Page Ranking. The proposed algorithm is efficient in terms of relevancy because it uses agents to determine pages content relevancy and user behavior is also considered while ranking the web pages.

Apriori is one of the most broadly used and popular algorithm of frequent itemset mining. Designing efficient algorithms on MapReduce framework to process and analyze big datasets is contemporary research nowadays. In this paper, we have focused on the performance of MapReduce based Apriori on homogeneous as well as on heterogeneous Hadoop cluster. We have investigated a number of factors that significantly affects the execution time of MapReduce based Apriori running on homogeneous and heterogeneous Hadoop Cluster. Factors are specific to both algorithmic and non-algorithmic improvements. Considered factors specific to algorithmic improvements are filtered transactions and data structures. Experimental results show that how an appropriate data structure and filtered transactions technique drastically reduce the execution time. The non-algorithmic factors include speculative execution, nodes with poor performance, data locality & distribution of data blocks, and parallelism control with input split size. We have applied strategies against these factors and fine tuned the relevant parameters in our particular application. Experimental results show that if cluster specific parameters are taken care of then there is a significant reduction in execution time. Also we have discussed the issues regarding MapReduce implementation of Apriori which may significantly influence the performance. © 2016 IEEE.",Apriori; Big Data; Frequent Itemset Mining; Heterogeneous Hadoop Cluster; MapReduce,Data mining; Data structures; Apriori; Frequent itemset mining; Heterogeneous Hadoop Cluster; Map-reduce; Mapreduce frameworks; Mining frequent itemsets; Scalable algorithms; Speculative execution; Big data,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

This paper proposes a new technique to provide privacy preservation of sensitive data based on the semantic context. Multisource Keyword Extraction and Graph Construction for Privacy Preservation involves extracting keywords from various data formats and preserving privacy among the keywords extracted using the techniques of Vector Marking. Initially, data cleaning and preprocessing is done on the document to extract keywords by applying techniques such as parsing, duplicate elimination, stemming and indexing. The document can be either PDF, SQL or Word files. After preprocessing, a context graph is generated from the keywords extracted with the help of context dictionaries such as WordNet and DBpedia. This context graph acts as a primary source of reference for all user queries. Privacy preservation of sensitive information is achieved using various Vector Marking techniques. The data input by the user can be classified as structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. Appropriate Vector Marking approaches are used for the given input data format. The keyword specified by the user in the input data as private is queried in the context graph to obtain the correlated words and these words are hidden from the access of the other users. Thus solving some of the issues related to privacy leakage. © 2017 ACM.",Context Graph; Extraction; Indexing; Parsing; Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Stemming; Vector Marking,Data privacy; Education; Extraction; Indexing (of information); Input output programs; Semantics; Vectors; Context Graph; Duplicate elimination; Parsing; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving data mining; Semi structured data; Sensitive informations; Stemming; Data mining,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Once the information is combined, it becomes the wealth information which can be used for research. Researcher directly applies data mining techniques and algorithm on the original dataset to fetch information, which may leads to leakage of privacy data. Large amount of data leads to exposure of identity. To meet this privacy concern, unique identity is removed from the original data before applying publishing data for research. Even though individual identity is disclosure by linking different datasets. To protect privacy, privacy preserving mechanism (PPM) is used. In this paper, we suggested new method to get desired level of privacy stored in both local and distributed environment. Our methodology for privacy includes anonymization technique applied to grouped data so as to get more accuracy. In this proposed method, we applied generalization privacy technique to selected quasi identifier by setting range values as min-max.

To access random data for low latency, Apache HBase is the solution.Based on performed results,it is shown that if dataset stored through HBase on HDFS,space and time complexity can be achieved better with Apriori MapReduce algorithm for finding association rules . © 2016 IEEE.",Data mining; Distributed system; Hadoop; Hbase; HDFS; Mapreduce; Pattern discovery,Association rules; Decision making; Distributed systems; Hadoop; Hbase; HDFS; Map-reduce; Pattern discovery; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

There are various algorithms which extract such itemsets from large database based on Minimum Support Threshold (MST). They further generate association rules based on Minimum Confidence Threshold (MCT). These two threshold values are defined by user or organization. Apriori is one of the most popular data mining algorithms but it generates all frequent itemsets and association rules which may be of user's interest or may not be. Proposed algorithm prunes all uninteresting frequent itemsets generated in every level and only considers those items and rules which are of interest based on MST and MCT. It saves considerable storage space and time. Every level prunes such items and rules which are of no interest and forwards the resultant list to next iteration. © 2016 IEEE.,Apriori algorithm; Association rule mining; Constraint mining; Data mining; MCT; MST,Association rules; Digital storage; Iterative methods; Apriori algorithms; Constrained items; Data mining algorithm; Large database; Minimum confidence thresholds; Minimum support thresholds; Storage spaces; User's interest; Data mining,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Many Projected Clustering algorithms have been proposed to deal with noisy High Dimensional Data. However, most of them encounter difficulties when data contain clusters with low dimensionality. This paper proposes an improvement over PCKA-Projected Clustering based on K-Means Algorithm which is a partitional distance based projected clustering algorithm. Existing PCKA performs relevancy analysis to select set of dimensions. However there is no scope for redundancy analysis. Improved PCKA described in this paper performs both attribute redundancy and relevancy analysis, followed by outlier detection. In the last phase, Improved PCKA forms clusters using modified K-Means algorithm. Method used for performing attribute redundancy is unique to this paper. Proposed algorithm is capable of detecting projected clusters of better quality and reduction in the computational time complexity compared to the original PCKA. © 2016 IEEE.",High Dimensional Data(HDD); PCKA(Projected Clustering based on K-Means Algorithm); Projected Clustering,Data mining; Redundancy; Computational time complexity; Curse of dimensionality; Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise; High dimensional data; High-dimensional dataset; k-Means algorithm; Projected clustering; Traditional clustering; Clustering algorithms,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

It helps law enforcement authorities in searching particular criminal from their previous record. It has been reported that searching a criminal record manually requires too much time to get the accurate result. We have proposed a query-based approach which minimises the computational cost along with the reduction of search space. A symbolic database has been created to perform a stringent analysis on 150 public (Bollywood celebrities and Indian cricketers) and 90 local faces (our data-set). An expert knowledge has been captured to encapsulate every criminal’s anatomical and facial attributes in the form of symbolic representation. A fast query-based searching strategy has been implemented using dynamic decision tree data structure which allows four levels of decomposition to fetch respective criminal records. Two types of case studies - viewed and forensic sketches have been considered to evaluate the strength of our proposed approach. We have derived 1200 views of the entire population by taking into consideration 80 participants as eyewitness. The system demonstrates an accuracy level of 98.6% for test case I and 97.8% for test case II. It has also been reported that experimental results reduce the search space up to 30 most relevant records. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.,classification; Criminal identification; dynamic query optimisation; expert system; knowledge extraction; knowledge representation; reasoning,Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Expert systems; Knowledge representation; Query processing; Trees (mathematics); Vision; Computational costs; Dynamic Query; Enforcement authorities; Knowledge extraction; reasoning; Searching strategy; Symbolic representation; Tree data structures; Crime,"Singh, A.K.; Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Indian Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: rs110@iiita.ac.in",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,0952813X,,,,English,J.

In many of the cases, we will be in a dilemma that which algorithm to be considered for solving the problems with best results. This paper includes study of prediction algorithms and suggests a method called meta-learning, that helps in choosing/picking an apt algorithm by using data characteristics such as simple data characteristics, information theoretic data characteristics and statistical data characteristics. Final results are shown and generated using UCI datasets. This paper makes use of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier to find out best algorithm for optimal results. Accuracy of the classifier is taken as main feature to consider/rate the algorithm as suitable algorithm. Meta-learning is used as a precise method which works well based on the given input data and reduces the overload of comparing each method with every other method, then selecting an appropriate algorithm. For all the data sets, the experiments conducted demonstrates that predicted accuracies match with actual ones for about more than 92%.It is to be noted very importantly that the following parameters play vital role in selecting the algorithm according to their accuracy: • Number of attributes • Number of instances • Number of classes •Probability of class • Entropy. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Natural language processing; Summarization survey; Text mining; Text summarization,Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Surveys; Automatic text summarization; Extractive approach; Extractive summarizations; NAtural language processing; Optimization techniques; Research communities; Text mining; Text summarization; Text processing,"Gupta, V.; University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: vishal_gupta100@yahoo.co.in",,Springer Netherlands,2692821,,AIRVE,,English,Artif Intell Rev,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962307022

Data mining techniques are used to implement and solve different types of research problems related to knowledge discovery from data. Text mining is one of the research areas related to data mining. Text mining is the process of mining useful information from text documents. Text documents are unstructured. So, for mining useful information from text documents, preprocessing techniques are applied to the text documents to convert the raw textual data into a structured document. Stemming is a preprocessing technique that maps various morphological forms of a word to the stem of the word. In 1980, M. F. Porter proposed an algorithm for stemming words from an English text. This paper discusses about the stemming process and the first algorithm proposed by Porter. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group.",,Natural language processing systems; Morphological forms; Preprocessing techniques; Research problems; Structured document; Text document; Text mining; Textual data; Data mining,,Mukherjee S.Bhattacharjee A.K.Deyasi A.Debnath P.,CRC Press/Balkema,,9.78114E+12,,,English,Comput.

In general, most of the enormous discovered patterns are obvious, redundant or uninteresting to the user. So the context of this paper is to improve apriori algorithm to find association rules pertaining to only important attributes from high dimensional data. We employ an information theoretic method together with the concept of QR decomposition to represent the data in its proper substructure form without losing its semantics, by identifying significant attributes.

At any time, unused frequency spectrum can be sensed by cognitive radio from the wide range of wireless radio spectrum. So, as a result this gives really an efficient utilization of radio resources. Major factors that govern cognitive radio network (CRN) are related to service contradiction, routing, and jamming attacks which may interfere with other operating wireless technologies.

Experimental work on data collected from city of New York is presented in this work. This data collected from taxis is used to analyze the presence of traffic in the area. Temporal data segmentation with respect to different time zones is performed considering the dynamic patterns of urban traffic. Next, popular data mining techniques of clustering are applied on this segmented data to form clusters for each time zone so as to identify areas of high traffic. Further, another data set of bus stops is used to identify places with no bus stops and high traffic congestions. Henceforth new bus stops are suggested on places with high traffic density and no bus stops.

In this paper, hybridization between the improved particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm has been performed with fuzzy c-means algorithm for data clustering. The proposed method has been compared with some of the existing algorithms like genetic algorithm, PSO, and K-means method. Simulation result shows that the proposed method is efficient and can divulge encouraging results for finding global optimal solutions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Differential evolution; Fuzzy c-means; Genetic algorithm; Particle swarm optimization,Artificial intelligence; Copying; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Optimal systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Complex optimization problems; Differential Evolution; Fitness evaluations; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy C means clustering; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; Global optimal solutions; Meta-heuristic techniques; Clustering algorithms,"Nayak, J.; Department of CSE, Modern Engineering & Management StudiesIndia; email: mailtojnayak@gmail.com",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

In top-down approach, a system is specified in terms of global state and the desired analyses are performed using aggregated macro-behaviour that represents the overall system. Essentially, the individual elements and their peculiarities are not differentiated with an assumption that the inherent dynamics of the overall system is precisely known to the system modellers. This paper, in contrast, presents a case wherein the system behaviour emerges from the individual elements and their interactions.

Big data consist of data sets which is difficult for legacy database management system to analysis. This paper details some analysis like sentiment analysis, feedback analysis. Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining, is a process of getting views of public from feedback or review. Opinion are central to almost all human activities because they are key influencer of our behavior. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying positive, negative or even neutral opinion. Feedback is detail about reaction to a product, a person performance of a task, etc. that can be used as a basis for enhancement. Feedback are chief means for the system enrichment, finding ambiguities and as well as for proper work distribution. Feedback can be used as a tool to draw proper decision, it is important not only when it highlights weaknesses but also for strengths. Since the feedback can induce both positive and negative, it is mandate to be careful when drawing any conclusion as improper analysis can produce wrong results. As a result the enhancements done will also be wring in the new system.

This project collects metadata from twitter users, analyses their tweets and gets a set of associated probabilities for a set of topics generated from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. The collected information is mined and is stored in a unique data structure consisting of various layers that represent a user. This structure is stored using a hash function, which facilitates the easy storage and retrieval of the structure. A destination tree is built based on the data mined from the tourist websites of states in India, the leaves of the tree representing a tourist destination in India and each having its associated set of probabilities for a set of topics generated from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model.

The gain ratio is normalized information gain of attributes and is not biased toward multi-valued attributes. In addition, the proposed approach computes the fitness of individuals from a pre-computed matrix of posterior probabilities using Bayesian framework instead of making repeated training database scans. This approach for fitness computation increases the efficiency of the proposed GA by eliminating a large number of database scans.

Association rule mining (ARM) is one of the techniques in data processing with the two sub processes. One is identifying frequent itemsets and the other is association rule mining. Frequent itemset mining has developed as a major issue in data mining and assumes an essential part in various data mining tasks, for example, association analysis, classification, etc. In the structure of frequent itemset mining, the outcomes are itemsets which are frequent in the entire database. Association rule mining is a basic data mining task. Researchers developed many algorithms for finding frequent itemsets and association rules. However, relying upon the choice of the thresholds, present algorithms become very slow and produce a greatly large amount of outcomes or generates few outcomes, omitting usable information. Furthermore, it is well-known that an expansive extent of association rules produced is redundant. This is truly a significant issue because in practice users don’t have much asset for analyzing the outcomes and need to find a certain amount of outcomes within a limited time. To address this issue, we propose a one of a kind algorithm called top-k association rules (TKAR) to mine top positioned data from a data set. The proposed algorithm uses a novel technique for generating association rules.

In order to provide a seamless transfer between various technologies, the effect of various user preference metrics and network conditions needs to be considered. This paper proposes a multilayer feedforward artificial neural network algorithm for handover decision in wireless heterogeneous networks. Neural network aids in taking the handover and selection of best candidate based on data rate, service cost, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and velocity of mobile device.

Hence, data mining on graphs has become quite popular in the past few years. The problem of finding frequent itemsets in conventional data mining on transactional databases, thus transformed to the discovery of subgraphs that frequently occur in the graph dataset containing either single graph or multiple graphs. Most of the existing algorithms in the field of frequent subgraph discovery adopts an Apriori approach based on generation of candidate set and test approach. The problem with this approach is the costlier candidate set generation, particularly when there exist more number of large subgraphs. The research goals in frequent subgraph discovery are to evolve (i) mechanisms that can effectively generate candidate subgraphs excluding duplicates and (ii) mechanisms that find best processing techniques that generate only necessary candidate subgraphs in order to discover the useful and desired frequent subgraphs. In this paper, a two phase approach is proposed by integrating Apriori algorithm on graphs to frequent subgraph (FS) tree to discover frequent subgraphs in graph datasets. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

With the increase in digital data sharing, data breaches have also increased significantly resulting in sensitive information being accessed by unintended recipients. To protect documents against such unauthorized access, the documents are assigned a security policy which is a set of users and information about their access permissions on the document. With the surge in the volume of digital documents, manual assignment of security policies is infeasible and error prone calling for an automatic policy assignment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that analyzes the sensitive information and historic access permissions to identify content-access correspondence via a novel multi-label classifier formulation.

As number of cases are increasing rapidly, automation becomes highly desirable. This paper presents two such systems viz. Automatic Catchphrase Detection and Automatic Precedence Detection. Automatic Catchphrase Detection: One of the key requirements of such information retrieval system is to pre-populate database of prior cases with catchphrases for better indexing and faster, relevant retrieval. This paper proposes an automatic catchphrases prediction for cases for the same. The problem catchphrase detection has been modeled as ""custom named entity recognition (NER) using conditional random fields (CRF)"". CRF is trained with pairs of prior cases and their respective catchphrases, the gold standards. The model is, then used to predict catch-phases of unseen legal texts. End of the first section demonstrates efficacy of the proposed system using practical data-set. Automatic Precedence Detection: Due to thousands of past cases it becomes tedious and error-prone to find relevant precedent, manually. An automatic precedent retrieval system is the need of the hour. One of the key requirements of such information system is to find cases which could be ""similar"" to the case in hand. The ""similarity"" used in this paper is about citations. The problem is of predicting prior cases which could potentially be cited by a particular case text. This paper proposes such association system using mixed approaches. It employs rule-based Regular Expressions based on references to statute and Articles. It finds cosine similar ity between case susing vector sgenerated by popular word embedding called doc2vec.

It provides a player the platform to explore the exponential complexity of the game through their intellectual moves in the game. Though, the number of players, pieces, and board dimension and squares are finite, it is a game where the combination of moves for each player will change distinctly from game to game. Now, moving onto the field of Cryptography, which aims to achieve security for the data by encrypting it, and makes the plain text unintelligible for the intruders. Taking advantage of the numerous moves in the game of Chess, we can form an amalgamation of Chess game and cryptography. Chessography is the confluence of the game of Chess and Cryptography. Encryption will take place in the form of moves played by each player on the board. Resulting cipher text produced will be a Product Cipher, where the square positions on the game board will be substituted by new square positions during the move in the game and all the actual values dealt with, throughout the game will form the transposed cipher text. Chessography algorithm uses two keys, one fixed length and one variable length key called as ‘paired key’. Along with the strength of keys generated, this algorithm generates a very strong cipher text as each game of chess is different, so is the cipher text generated. The complexity in the game of chess forms the Chessography’s defensive strength to deal against various attacks during the data transmission. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Chess; Chessography; Complexity; Cryptography; Encryption; Paired key; Product cipher,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Metals; Chess; Chessography; Complexity; Paired key; Product cipher; Cryptography,"Kamat, V.K.; Department of Computer Engineering, Agnel Institute of Technology and DesignIndia; email: vaishnavikunkolikerkamat@gmail.com",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

In many large volume of data stream processing, stream clustering helps to find the valuable hidden information. Many works have concentrated on clustering the data streams using various methods, but mostly those approaches lack in some core tasks needed to improve the cluster accuracy and quick processing of data streams. To tackle the problem of improving cluster quality and reducing the time for data stream processing time in cluster generation, the partition-based DBStream clustering method is proposed. The result has been compared with various data stream clustering methods, and it is evident from the experiments that the purity of clusters improves 5% and the time taken is reduced by 10% than the average time taken by other methods for clustering the data streams. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Cosine similarity; DBStream; Join; Macro-clustering; Micro-clustering; Partition; Tweets,Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Data communication systems; Data handling; Joining; Partitions (building); Cluster accuracies; Clustering methods; Cosine similarity; Data stream clustering; Data stream processing; DBStream; Micro-clustering; Tweets; Data mining,"Arun Manicka Raja, M.; Department of Information Science and Technology, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna UniversityIndia; email: arunmanick@auist.net",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Finally, the sentiments from all the aspects are clubbed together taking into account the hierarchical level of aspects in the domain ontology to refine the overall review polarity.

Detailed LULC classification requires both high spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral remote sensing or imaging spectroscopy captures information in a large number of contiguous bands for each pixel in an image. High resolution hyperspectral data, rich in both contextual and spectral information, can be used to generate detailed information about various materials and entities on the Earth's surface. Traditional pixel-based classifiers fail to distinguish between different features such as building roof types or vegetation species owing to similarity of spectral signatures leading to merging of classes. This difficulty is overcome by object based classification approach which divides the image into several homogenous objects considering the textural and spatial properties along with spectral characteristics thereby yielding a more effective, efficient and accurate classification of surface features. This study assesses the potential of airborne hyperspectral data for LULC information extraction using pixel based and object-based approaches. Preprocessing steps included geometric correction of surface reflectance image following which noisy bands were removed. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used for pixel based classification while multi-resolution segmentation followed by hierarchical classification using nearest neighbor algorithm has been adopted for object based approach. Ten target classes were taken and the results for both approaches have been compared using confusion matrix parameters and Pearson's Kappa Coefficient. It was found that object based image analysis gave better classification results in comparison to SAM and SVM.

There are various properties of graphs such as clustering coefficient (CC), density, arboricity, etc. We introduce a measure, Clique Conversion Coefficient (CCC), which captures the clique forming tendency of nodes in an undirected graph. CCC could either be used as a weighted average of the values in a vector or as the vector itself. Our experiments show that CCC provides additional information about a graph in comparison to related measures like CC and density. We cluster the real world graphs using a combination of the features CCC, CC, and density and show that without CCC as one of the features, graphs with similar clique forming tendencies are not clustered together. The clustering with the use of CCC would have applications in the areas of Social Network Analysis, Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis, etc., where cliques have an important role. We perform the clustering of ego networks of the YOUTUBE network using values in CCC vector as features.

Business intelligence thus obtained can add value to decision support systems. The applications that benefit from this include detecting manufacturing flaws, identifying behavioural change of customers, detecting fraud to mention few. In this paper we propose a data mining based probabilistic framework that can elegantly provide anomalous observations from the given datasets. The observations which do not comply with normal and expected behaviour or pattern are known as outliers. These outliers help improve expert decision making by considering the intelligence obtained in the form of outliers. Two models are employed in this paper. We explored EM algorithm and mixture modes to have a general framework for probabilistic knowledge discovery through outlier detection. We built a prototype application to demonstrate the proof of concept.

This model is an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy k-Mode in which the notion of fitness related objective functions, crossovers, mutations and probability has been added to provide better clusters for the data objects. Also the intuitionistic parameter has been retained for the calculation of membership values of element x in a given cluster. UCI repository datasets were used for assessing efficacy of algorithms. The qualified analysis and results depict much consistent performance, where a significant improvement is achieved as compared to intuitionistic fuzzy k-Mode and simulated annealing based intuitionistic fuzzy k-mode.

This paper presents one of the methods for web information extraction and alignment is CTVS which is novel and improved technique which exploits tag as well as value similarity in a web page. The proposed approach fetches information through query result pages automatically by identifying QRRs, construction of tag tree and separating QRRs (query result records) in a query result page. Extracted data can be aligned in pairwise or holistic alignment technique. The segmented query result records are arranged according to same attribute of data values in database table.

Automated extraction approaches identify key elements in regulatory text, and create annotated, in some cases structured, representations of regulation text. It is desirable to combine the two approaches to automate creation of a regulation rule base that can be used for inferencing and reasoning about compliance. In this paper we present a semi-automated approach that uses a generic semantic model of regulations to guide automated extraction of rule suggestions. The suggestions help domain experts author rules in Structured English using the generic model as template.

Potential consumers exhibit sincere intents in seeking opinions of other consumers who have already had a usage experience of the products they are intending to make a purchase decision on. The underlying businesses also deem it fit to ascertain common public opinions regarding the quality of their products as well as services. However, the consumer reviews have bulked over time to such an extent that it has become a highly challenging task to read all the reviews, even if limiting to only the top ones, to reach an informed purchase decision or have an insight regarding how satisfied or not the consumers of a particular product are. Since most of the reviews are either unstructuctured or semi-structured, information classification is employed to derive knowledge from the reviews. However, most classification methods based on sentiment orientation of reviews do not detect which features of a product were specifically liked or disliked by a reviewer. This constitutes itself into another problem since most consumers are on the lookout for certain prerequisite features while viewing the products. The paper proposes a Consumer Satisfaction Rating System (CSRS) based on sentiment analysis of consumer reviews in context of the features of a product. The system aims at providing a summary that represents the extent to which the consumers were satisfied or unsatisfied with the specific features of a product. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.",E-Commerce; Online reviews; Opinion mining; Product features; Sentiment analysis,Classification (of information); Commerce; Electronic commerce; Smart city; Classification methods; Consumer satisfactions; Information classification; Online reviews; Opinion mining; Product feature; Purchase decision; Sentiment analysis; Data mining,"Gaurav, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology PatnaIndia; email: kumargaurav.nitp@gmail.com",Simintiras A.Al-Sharhan S.Kar A.K.Ilavarasan P.V.Gupta M.P.Mantymaki M.Dwivedi Y.K.Janssen M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

To improve the prediction accuracy of GM, the Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model (NGBM) is used. The NGBM model is having the capability to produce more reliable outcomes. The NGBM with power r is a nonlinear differential equation. Using power r in NGBM the expected result can be controlled and adjusted to fit the results of 1-AGO historical raw data. NGBM is a recent grey prediction model to easily adjust for the correctness of GM(1, 1) stable with a BDE. The differentiation of desired outcome with the actual GM(1, 1) has been displayed through a feasible forecasting model NGBM(1, 1) by accumulating the decisive variables.

This paper presents an algorithm that automates the process of finding reaction classes from known chemical reaction graphs. The algorithm presented here is sufficiently general to cover both organic and inorganic chemical reactions and can be applied to wider varieties of reactions. This graph mining algorithm derives all the reaction classes obtained from earlier schemes and thus earlier schemes are subsets of the present algorithm.

The continuous evolution of software makes it impossible to perform exhaustive testing. The need for regression testing is to uncover new software bugs in existing system after some changes have been made to ensure that the existing functionalities are working fine. Re-executing the whole test suite is time-consuming as well as expensive. Hence, this issue can be handled by test case prioritization technique. Prioritization helps to organize the test suites in an effective manner where high-priority test cases are executed earlier than the low priority test cases based on some criteria.

The penetration of smart phones, tabs etc has significantly changed the way people communicate. Facebook and Twitter are two most popular social media platforms, where people post about events, their personal daily activities and plans. And also post their thoughts, responses or reactions for any public cause or issue. In the recent times we have seen how the facebook posts and twitter tweets have helped in mobilizing people in states such as Tamil Nadu (TN) and Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) in India. The mass public protests for the ""Jallikattu"" event in TN and stone pelting protests in J&K are prominent examples of how social media has impacted the common man. The information about events or happenings in real time is very valuable to the administration for disaster management, crowd control, public alerting. These information which is used in the development of recommender systems adds value for the growth of business enterprises. Thus there is great need to develop automatic systems for automatic event extraction. This paper presents the overview of the task ""Event extraction in Indian languages"", a track in FIRE 2017. The task of this track is to extract events from the social media text, The Twitter. Some of the main issues in handling of such social media texts are i) Spelling errors ii) Abbreviated new language vocabulary such as ""gr8"" for great iii) use of symbols such as emoticons/emojis iv) use of meta tags and hash tags and v) Code mixing, though in this track, we have not considered code mixing. Though event extraction from Indian language texts is gaining attention among Indian research community, however there is no benchmark data available for testing the systems. Hence we have organized the Event Extraction in social media text track for Indian languages (EventXtract-IL) in the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE).

Be that as it may, a large segment of existing strategies concentrate on the recommendation situations where users can give express feedback to items. Be that as it may, much of the time, the feedback isn't express however understood. Additionally, the majority of trust aware techniques expect the trust relationships among users are single and homogeneous, while trust as a social idea is naturally multi-faceted and heterogeneous. Just abusing the crude estimations of trust relations can't get agreeable outcomes. In light of the above perceptions, we propose to take in a trust aware personalized ranking method with multi-faceted trust relations for certain input. Recommender systems have been generally used to furnish users with top notch customized recommendations from an extensive volume of decisions. Hearty and exact recommendations are imperative in internet business operations (e.g., exploring item offerings, personalization, enhancing consumer loyalty), and in promoting. The previous issue alludes to the way that users as a rule rate just a little bit of items while the last shows that new users just give a couple of ratings. The two issues extremely corrupt the effectiveness of a recommender system in displaying client inclinations and therefore the exactness of anticipating a user’s appraising for an ambiguous item. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

In order to keep the patient's vision, the early detection and periodic screening of DR plays an important role in eye diagnosis by examining the deformity in retinal fundus images. During the early detection of DR, ophthalmologists identify the lesions called microaneurysms that emerge as the first symptom of the disease. The various test methods availability and the handlings of all these test methods for detection of DR are not possible in rural areas. The automatic DR detection system offers the potential to be used in large-scale screening programs. This paper presents a hybrid classifier and region-dependent integrated features for detection of DR automatically. In the proposed hybrid classifier, holoentropy enabled decision tree is combined with a feed forward neural network using the proposed score level fusion method. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing classification algorithms using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Two different databases such as DIARETDB0 and DIARETDB1 are utilized for the experimentation.

Media files, like audio, video, image, etc., are utilized to embed the message. Nowadays, steganography is also used to transmit the medical information or diagnostic reports. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the novel wavelet transform-based steganographic method is proposed for secure data communication using OFDM system. The embedding and extraction process in the proposed steganography method exploits the wavelet transform. Initially, the cost matrix is estimated by the following three aspects: pixel intensity, edge transformation and wavelet transform. The cost estimation matrix provides the location of the cover image where the message is to be entrenched. Then, the wavelet transform is utilized to embed the message into the cover image according to the cost value. Subsequently, in the extraction process, the wavelet transform is applied to the embedded image to retrieve the message efficiently. Finally, in order to transfer the secret information over the channel, the newly developed wavelet-based steganographic method is employed for the OFDM system. Findings: The experimental results are evaluated and performance is analyzed using PSNR and MSE parameters and then compared with existing systems. Thus, the outcome of our wavelet transform steganographic method achieves the PSNR of 71.5 dB which ensures the high imperceptibility of the image. Then, the outcome of the OFDM-based proposed steganographic method attains the higher PSNR of 71.07 dB that proves the confidentiality of the message. Originality/value: In the authors’ previous work, the embedding and extraction process was done based on the cost estimation matrix. To enhance the security throughout the communication system, the novel wavelet-based embedding and extraction process is applied to the OFDM system in this paper. The idea behind this method is to attain a higher imperceptibility and robustness of the image. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data mining; DNA computing,Convolutional codes; Cost estimating; Costs; Data mining; Diagnosis; Extraction; Image processing; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Steganography; Wavelet analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Diagnostic Report; DNA-computing; Existing systems; Extraction process; Medical information; Pixel intensities; Secret information; Wavelet transforms,"Nipanikar, S.I.; Veltech Dr. RR & Dr. SR UniversityIndia; email: nipanikar.si@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,1756378X,,,,English,Int.

An efficient energy management strategy for smart homes results in minimized electricity consumption leading to cost savings. Towards this goal, we investigate the impact of environmental factors on home energy consumption. Home energy demand is observed to be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and humidity which are inherently uncertain. Analyzing the impact of these factors on electricity consumption is challenging due to the unpredictability of weather conditions and non-linear relationship between environmental factors and electricity demand. For demand estimation based on these time varying factors, a hybrid intelligent system is developed that integrates the adaptability of neural networks and reasoning of fuzzy systems to predict daily electricity demand. A smart home dataset is utilized to build an unsupervised artificial neural network known as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). We further develop a fuzzy rule based system from the SOM to predict home energy demand. Evaluation of the system shows a strong correlation between home energy demand and environmental factors and that the system predicts home energy consumption with higher accuracy.

In this study, a new ternary particle swarm optimization (TPSO) algorithm has been proposed, in which particle is a string of ""trit"", which is the smallest unit of information. Ternary string is made up of (0, 1 and #). 0, 1 and # are representatives of rejection, acceptance and intermediate (uncertain) states respectively. Since trit is the smallest unit of information therefore, # trit brings the characteristics of quantum theory in the search. This provides the better exploration of feature leading to global optimum solution. This method belongs to wrapper category of feature selection method since it has k nearest neighbor classifier as performance evaluator. The TPSO has been applied in two phases. The second phase is included in the system in a top down information processing fashion, in which big system of information is broken down to have insight into the hidden important information. In first phase TPSO is applied multiple times on each data set. In second phase optimum features are retrieved by applying LBUB, EXP-SEARCH and VOTE-MERGE methods. Experimental results on bench marking datasets show that the proposed methods are promising to handle feature selection in high dimensional space. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Automation of repeatable IT tasks using software service agents that reduce human effort is therefore an important component of service management. A large fraction of the work done by IT service personnel involves troubleshooting of problems. However, the complexity of IT systems makes automated problem determination and resolution a challenging research problem. Using a database of prior customer problems and solutions, we build a system that extracts knowledge about different classes of problems arising in the IT infrastructure, mine problem linkages to recent system changes, and identify the resolution activities to mitigate problems. The system, at its core, uses data mining, machine learning, and natural language parsing techniques. By using extracted knowledge, one can (i) understand the kind of problems and the root causes affecting the IT infrastructure, (ii) proactively remediate the causes so that they no longer result in problems, and (iii) estimate the scope for automation for service management. In the future, a large cost differentiator for any IT company will often involve being able to build automated service agents from these technologies, which will result in a reduction in human effort. © 1957-2012 IBM.",Automation; Complexity theory; Data mining; Databases; Natural language processing; Noise measurement,Automation; Database systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Software agents; Automated services; Complexity theory; IT infrastructures; Natural language parsing; NAtural language processing; Noise measurements; Problem determination; Unstructured texts; Data mining,,,IBM Corporation,188646,,IBMJA,,English,IBM J.

The basis for defining similarity among different polymers is the partition coefficients associated with sorption of chemical analytes from vapor phase to polymer phase in thermodynamic equilibrium. The goal for selection is to identify a minimal set of polymers that provide the most diversely interaction possibilities with the target vapors. The proposed selection method has been validated by simulating responses of a polymer-coated surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor array for detection of freshness and spoilage of milk and fish food products. The end use of the proposed selection method is suggested for developing low-cost high-performance sensor array based electronic noses for commercial and consumer applications. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.,Data mining for sensor selection; Electronic nose; Fuzzy subtractive clustering; Intelligent system for food monitoring,Acoustic surface wave devices; Acoustic waves; Chemical analysis; Data mining; Electronic equipment; Electronic nose; Food products; Intelligent systems; Problem solving; Soft computing; Spoilage; Consumer applications; Fuzzy subtractive clustering; High performance sensors; Measure of similarities; Partition coefficient; Polymer coated surfaces; Sensor selection; Thermodynamic equilibria; Polymers,"Yadava, R.D.S.; Sensors and Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Physics, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu UniversityIndia; email: ardius@gmail.com",Bansal J.C.Pant M.Das K.N.Nagar A.K.Garg H.Deep K.Lal A.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The rules and processes continuously change to reflect the enterprise's evolution and progress, market demands and regulations. This constant flux demands an automatic way to check these business rules for correctness and consistency. In the recent times, few methods were proposed for automated checks. In our literature review for this subject matter, however, we did not find a proper survey, which could present a consolidated picture of the properties, advantages and drawbacks of the different methods. The randomly scattered state of art for specifying business rules and analyzing them for inconsistencies is hindering the relevant research space. We conduct a systematic literature review of various solutions discussed in the field of consistency checking for business rules, especially rules in Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules (SBVR) format. We highlight the progress made in the field, aspects that can be developed further, and the current gaps in the methods so that future work can be channelized to address and close the gaps by proposing new or enhanced methods.

To resolve these heterogeneities, the key challenge is how to provide common semantic representation for context-dependent data stream formats along with streaming databases. To address such issues, this paper proposes an ontology driven formal semantics of context-dependent data streams together with a universal conceptualization of streaming databases. The novelty of this work is to handle heterogeneity, large volume and availability of streaming data, such as web content, commercial broadcasting data etc. It also facilitates to recognize evolving information from semantic representation of data streams at conceptual modelling level. Besides, the proposed conceptual model is flexible to represent finite partition of stream and thus help in data stream storing and further querying. The conceptualization is implemented using an ontology editorial tool Protégé for the initial validation of proposed set of formal semantics. Several crucial properties of the proposed conceptualization are specified in order to exhibit the benefits of the proposed work.

Breast Cancer is a malignant tumour that develops from the cells of the breast. In underdeveloped, developing and developed nations, the major cause of death among women is due to breast cancer. To mitigate the death caused by breast cancer, it is essential to detect it much earlier to provide the best treatment. An accurate diagnosis procedure is required which must also be quite reliable so that physicians are able to distinguish from the benign breast tumour from malignant ones. An important real world medical problem is to diagnose the breast cancer in an automated fashion. In this paper, an Expectation Maximization (EM) Based Logistic Regression (LR) is used to detect and classify the breast cancer at an early stage. From the cancer centre of Kuppuswamy Naidu Memorial Hospital, Coimbatore, India, the data was collected and it was classified with EM based LR The stages of cancer are divided into pathological and clinical stages and so the Tumour Node Metasis (TNM) prognostic tools are identified. The various TNM values are given as input variables for the classification of breast cancer.

This notion is an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy k-mode in which we have added the concept of energy related objective functions, temperature ranges and probability so as to provide better clusters for the data objects. There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics and the kind of multivariate optimization we are doing here. A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods. So simulated annealing has been used here. Also the intuitionistic parameter has been retained for the calculation of membership values of element x in a given cluster. Systematic experiments were carried out with datasets taken from the UCI Machine learning repository. The results and a comparative evaluation show a high performance and consistency of the proposed method, which achieves significant improvement compared to intuitionistic fuzzy k-mode.

It also helps to identify the most appropriate drug for curing the disease. Such microarray gene expression data is huge in volume to handle. All gene expressions are not necessary to predict a disease. Gene selection approaches pick only genes that play a prominent role in detecting a disease and drug for the same. In order to handle huge gene expression data, gene selection algorithms can be executed in parallel programming frameworks such as Hadoop Mapreduce and Spark.

This paper proposes the use of parts of speech (POS) tagging, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, to group the words or entities in a text into pre-defined domain specific concepts. For the purpose of extraction, the domain concepts from available Engineering Ontology related to mechanical domain from the literature is considered.

If we go by statistics of the World Health Organization(reports 2000), Cardiovascular Diseases represents about 25% of death rates in the whole world, especially in developed countries. Diagnosis is considered as a worthy yet complex and difficult task that needs to be done very efficiently and precisely. Clinical decisions are often made based on doctor’s intuition and experience rather than on the knowledge rich data hidden in the database. These practices sometimes lead to unwanted biases, errors and excessive medical costs which affects the quality of service provided to patients. Thus there is a need of effective data analysis tools to discover hidden relationships in data and produce more accurate results. In this research paper we intend to present an idea for a Heart Disease Prediction and Decision Support System using data mining modelling technique, namely, Naïve Bayes that can produce results with good or with least error and at a much lower cost. One such working model called GRACE risk score has already been build and is in use today. This system uses 8 factors namely age, systolic blood pressure, pulse, creatinine, killip value, cardiac arrest on admission, presence of abnormal cardiac enzymes and segment deviation if any. Our research uses this algorithm to compute Grace score and apply Naive Bayes over these score and also add an extra parameter BMI for better prediction of score. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

It enables the transfer of information globally. Spam mail is the practice of forwarding unfavourable and undesirable messages frequently. Recipients often consider it an undesired intervention in their mailbox. Inspired by classification algorithm, this paper introduces a hybrid approach of differential evolution algorithm and decision tree. In order to detect spam mail, we use decision tree for calculating the accuracy in the first phase. In the second phase, we calculate the output of decision tree and then we gave this measure as the inputs to differential evolution algorithm. Finally, the accuracy of the two methods i.e., combined form of decision tree and differential evolution are evaluated. For detecting spam mail, the combined form of differential evolution and decision tree is better than decision tree classifier since the accuracy obtained in the later is high. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

In recommender systems, predictions based on these few observations lead to avoidance of inherent latent features of the user corresponding to the item. Similarly, in different crowdsourcing based opinion aggregation models, there is a minimal chance to obtain opinions from all the crowd workers. Even this sparsity problem has an extensive effect in predicting actual rating of a particular item due to limited and incomplete observations. To deal with this issue, in this article, a genetic algorithm based matrix factorization technique is proposed to estimate the missing entries in the response matrix that contains workers’ responses over some questions.

Analyzing near-misses will provide relevant root causes behind such incidents so that effective safety related interventions can be developed beforehand. Despite having a huge potential towards workplace safety improvements, analysis of near-misses is scant in the literature owing to the fact that near-misses are often reported as text narratives. The aim of this study is therefore to explore text-mining for extraction of root causes of near-misses from the narrative text descriptions of such incidents and to measure their relationships probabilistically. Root causes were extracted by word cloud technique and causal model was constructed using a Bayesian network (BN). Finally, using BN’s inference mechanism, scenarios were evaluated and root causes were listed in a prioritized order. A case study in a steel plant validated the approach and raised concerns for variety of circumstances such as incidents related to collision, slip-trip-fall, and working at height. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Bayesian network; Narrative text; Near-miss incidents; Word cloud; Workplace safety,Accident prevention; Bayesian networks; Data mining; Steelmaking; Inference mechanism; Narrative text; Near-misses; Prioritization; Safety management systems; Safety-Related; Word clouds; Workplace safety; Occupational risks,"Verma, A.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: abhishekverma.cs@gmail.com",Tyagi V.Grosky W.Gupta P.K.Oren T.Singh M.Sharma A.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

This stored information is under serious safety threat, not only from an outsider, but also from a malicious insider, who has full information about the structure and functioning of the system. This has led to the incorporation of an intrusion detection mechanism, which provides access control for databases. However, mapping individual access patterns becomes infeasible due to the abundance of users. A solution to this problem is to classify the users into groups and identify their legitimate access patterns.

The proposed method clusters those genes that are within distance threshold t with respect to a specific gene in each experiment conditions and works on column wise distance calculation approach.

In earlier work we have modeled the impact of stress within such environments on the performance of the individual and correspondingly that of the team. Since teams are social environments, we can intuitively realise that social dimensions such as supervisory support would impact a team member's performance for the better or the worse. But what is the precise impact of supervisory support on a team's macro outcome parameters such as productivity and performance? Using the results of a ground study of a support services organization, we use an agent based simulation approach to understand the dynamics and the implications of supervisory support on individuals and consequently the macro parameters of the team.

Now it has come to light and is in demand because of amelioration in technology. Many applications are submitted to the data centers, and services are given as pay-per-use basis. As there is an increase in the client demands, the workload is increased, and as there are limited resources, workload is moved to different data centers in order to handle the client demands on as-you-pay basis. Hence, scheduling the increasing demand of workload in the cloud environments is highly necessary. In this paper, we propose three different task-scheduling algorithms such as Minimum-Level Priority Queue (MLPQ), MIN-Median, Mean-MIN-MAX which aims to minimize the makespan with maximum utilization of cloud.

This incoming data from heterogeneous sources is referred as data stream. Analysing data in motion (data streams) has become new challenge in order to meet the demands of real time analytics. Conventional mining techniques are proving inefficient since the behaviour of data itself has changed. Other challenges associated with data streams include resources constraints like memory and running time along with single scan of the data. Due to the time variant nature of data streams, applying any mining algorithm such as classification, clustering, indexing in a single scan of data is a tedious task. This paper focuses on concept drift problem in classification of streaming data. During classification a change in the concept or distribution of dataset over the time is termed as concept drift. The performance of a model/classifier degrades due to concept drift even in stationary data; dealing with this problem hence become more challenging in data streams. This paper presents categorization of existing streaming data classification algorithms along with their ability to solve concept drift problem. It also presents comparison of various tools available for simulating such problems along with their limitations. The paper also lists the various datasets and performance metrics that have been used in literature for performance analysis. Thus, this paper may serve as a complete roadmap for the researchers interested in designing new solutions for solving concept drift problem in streaming data classification. It also highlights the open research questions in this field. © 2017 The Authors.

Mining medical data is the most challenging task as the data are subjected to many social concerns and ethical issues. Moreover, medical data are more illegible as they contain many missing and misleading values and may sometimes be faulty. Thus, pre-processing tasks in medical data mining are of great importance, and the main focus is on feature selection, because the quality of the input determines the quality of the resultant data mining process. This paper provides insight to develop a feature selection process, where a data set subjected to constraint-governed association rule mining and interestingness measures results in a small feature subset capable of producing better classification results. From the results of the experimental study, the feature subset was reduced to more than 50% by applying syntax-governed constraints and dimensionality-governed constraints, and this resulted in a high-quality result. This approach yielded about 98% of classification accuracy for the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) data set. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.",association rules; constraint-based ARM; Data mining; feature selection; interestingness measures; SVM,Association rules; Classification (of information); Data mining; Feature extraction; Classification accuracy; Classification results; Constraint-based; Data mining process; Digital repository; Interestingness measures; Medical data mining; Science and Technology; Medical computing,"Salma, M.U.; Department of Computer Science, Mangalore UniversityIndia; email: hmbssalma@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,3341860,,JISYE,,English,J Intell Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008194150

With these growths in both core and interdisciplinary areas of research, analyzing interesting research trends can be helpful for new researchers and organizations geared towards collaborative work. Existing approaches used unsupervised learning methods such as clustering to group articles with similar characteristics for topic discovery, with low accuracy. Efficient and fast topic discovery models and future trend forecasters can be helpful in building intelligent applications like recommender systems for scholarly articles. In this paper, a novel approach to automatically discover topics (latent factors) from a large set of text documents using association rule mining on frequent itemsets is proposed. Temporal correlation analysis is used for finding the correlation between a set of topics, for improved prediction. To predict the popularity of a topic in the near future, time series analysis based on a set of topic vectors is performed.

Although a number of relevant approaches have been proposed in recent years, but they incur the problem of producing a large number of candidate itemsets for high utility itemsets. Such a large number of candidate itemsets degrades the mining performance in terms of execution time and space requirement. The situation may become worse when the database contains lots of long transactions or long high utility itemsets. An emerging topic in the field of data mining is utility mining which not only considers the frequency of the itemsets but also considers the utility associated with the itemsets. The main objective of High Utility Itemset Mining is to identify itemsets that have utility values above a given utility threshold. Thus Utility mining plays an important role in many real-time applications and is an important research topic in data mining system to find the itemsets with high profit. In this paper we present the implementation of first module where pre-processing of dataset is done to remove unpromising data from web usage and product base dataset by using TopKRules and also we are proposing a new framework for Top-k high utility web access patterns, where k is the desired number of HUIs to be mined.

Based on this algorithm we are performing comparison of sanitized data and existing data based on number of iterations and the execution time. The experimental results shows that the number of iteration is reduced in sanitized data than that of existing data also the time is reduced in sanitized data.

This information is processed to acquire knowledge. However, the process of information extraction from a Database System is cumbersome for non-expert users as it requires an extensive knowledge of DBMS languages. Therefore, an inevitable need arises to bridge the gap between user requirements and the provision of a simple information retrieval system whereby the role of a specialized Database Administrator is annulled. In this paper, we propose a methodology for building an Intelligent Querying System (IQS) by which a user can fire queries in his own (natural) language. The system first parses the input sentences and then generates SQL queries from the natural language expressions of the input. These queries are in turn mapped with the desired information to generate the required output. Hence, it makes the information retrieval process simple, effective and reliable. © 2017 IEEE.",Data Mining; Data Warehousing; MR Generator; Natural Language Processing; NLIDB; Query Generator; Semantic Builder; SQL,Data mining; Data warehouses; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Query processing; Search engines; Semantics; Amount of information; Database administrators; MR Generator; Natural language expressions; NLIDB; Query Generator; Simple informations; User requirements; Natural language processing systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,English,"Proc.

B2B setup is different from B2C setup in many ways. Along with the contrasting buying entity (company vs. individual), there are dissimilarities in order size (few dollars in e-commerce vs. up to several thousands of dollars in B2B), buying cycle (few days in B2C vs. 6-18 months in B2B) and most importantly a presence of multiple decision makers (individual or family vs. an entire company). Due to easy availability of the data and bargained complexities, most of the existing literature has been set in the B2C framework and there are not many examples in the B2B context. We present a unique approach to model next likely action of B2B customers by observing a sequence of digital actions. In this paper, we propose a unique two-step approach to model next likely action using a novel ensemble method that aims to predict the best digital asset to target customers as a next action. The paper provides a unique approach to translate the propensity model at an email address level into a segment that can target a group of email addresses. In the first step, we identify the high propensity customers for a given asset using traditional and advanced multinomial classification techniques and use non-negative least squares to stack rank different assets based on the output for ensemble model. In the second step, we perform a penalized regression to reduce the number of coefficients and obtain the satisfactory segment variables.

It learns the decision surface from two different classes of input samples and then performs analysis of new input samples. A neural network is able to learn without the explicit description of the problem or the need of a programmer. Another type of classification technique is the decision tree.

Code obfuscation has been demonstrated to provide time-limited protection of source code from inference or tampering attacks. However, size of the obfuscated code increases with increase in code size which can have a negative impact on energy consumption. In particular, different transformations of the source code result in varying amounts of energy consumption for embedded devices. In this work, we model the impact of algorithms for code obfuscation on energy usage for embedded devices and analyze the energy-security-performance trade-offs. The insights from our analysis can be used to develop techniques depending on the needs of the applications thus facilitating efficient energy usage.

In this paper, an application of the SVM in the multi-class gear-fault diagnosis has been performed based on the gear vibration data in time domain. From time domain data the statistical features are extracted and fed to the SVM for the training/testing. When the training and testing data are at the same running speed, it is found that the SVM classifier has excellent multiclass classification accuracy. Though, this approach relies on the availability of both the training and testing data at that particular speed of the machine operation; it is expected that features of time domain data would change with operating speeds. Moreover, the training data may not always be available continuously at all operating speeds of gears, especially for variable-drive systems. Thus, a novel technique of interpolation/extrapolation has been proposed in the present work that helps the SVM classifier to carryout multi-class gear-fault diagnosis with appreciable accuracy even in the absence of the training data at a given running speed. It also investigates the speed bandwidth of the training data for which interpolation/extrapolation predictions are reasonably good. The similar analysis is also extended to artificial neural networks (ANN) as the classifier and predictions are noted, and compared with the SVM. © 2017 Baishideng Publishing Group Co. Limited.

Apriori algorithm is considered as a typical algorithm to find frequent itemsets in market basket analysis. Since its inception, many efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of the original algorithm. MapReduce model is one of the efficient tools to implement parallel and distributed computing, so that large-scale data set algorithms such as Apriori algorithm can be made efficient in terms of speed up and other related parameters. One of the major drawbacks of the MapReduce model is that it is not suitable for iterative jobs/tasks due to overheads imposed. Now-a-days, Apache Spark is getting huge attention for iterative jobs because of its in-memory processing capabilities. Most of the frequent pattern mining algorithms consider only distinct items in a transaction. For transactional data analysis, multiple occurrences of an item or in other words “quantities” by which a particular item is purchased in the same transaction can be important to derive additional information about frequent itemsets. In this script, we propose a modified version of the Apriori algorithm based on Apache Spark framework that not only mines the frequent itemsets in the input transactional data but also analyzes related quantities of the items for a particular itemset to find the most frequent quantity being purchased for every frequent itemset. Experiments are conducted to gain insight in the form of effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed approach. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Apache spark; Apriori algorithm; Big data,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Efficiency; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Multiprocessing systems; Apriori algorithms; Frequent itemset mining; Frequent pattern mining; Large scale data sets; Market basket analysis; Original algorithms; Parallel and distributed computing; Processing capability; Big data,"Dharavath, R.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (ISM)India; email: ramesh.d.in@ieee.org",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Smart Grids which enable two-way communication and monitoring between service providers and end-users need novel computational intelligent algorithms for supporting generation of power from wide range of sources, efficient energy distribution, and sustainable consumption. Sustainability is of great importance due to increasing demands and limited resources. Many problem classes in sustainable energy systems are data mining, optimization, and control tasks. The aim of this paper is to focus on the existing electricity generation infrastructure, electricity consumption behavior of the consumers and the need for Smart Grid. The various methods that have been concentrated on are that of machine learning and data mining techniques that can be mapped to these smart grid environments. We use publicly available smart grid datasets such as: Residential Electricity consumption survey (RECS) dataset conducted in US; US SMART Home Microgrid dataset; Reference Energy Disaggregation dataset (REDD) and Almanac of Minutely Power (AMPds) aggregation Dataset in our analysis in order to optimize the energy consumption for sustainability. We utilize Gaussian process regression with Radial basis function (RBF) kernel, Best First Tree (BFTree) and Ordered weighted average fuzzy-rough K-nearest neighbor (OWAKNN) with equal width (EWD) and Genetic algorithm based Discretization (GAD) in our approach to predict and forecast the consumer behavior in electricity consumption.

Automation of such a process is going to be beneficial for industries facing shortage of skilled workforce. Machine Vision techniques are some of the popular approaches for developing such automations. Most of the existing works on the topic deal with identification of the rice variety by analyzing images of well separated and isolated rice grains from which a lot of geometrical features can be extracted. This paper proposes techniques to estimate geometrical parameters from the images of scattered as well as heaped rice grains where the grain boundaries are not clearly identifiable. A methodology based on convexity is proposed to separate touching rice grains in the scattered rice grain images and get their geometrical parameters. And in case of heaped arrangement a Pixel-Distance Contribution Function is defined and is used to get points inside rice grains and then to find the boundary points of rice grains. These points are fit with the equation of an ellipse to estimate their lengths and breadths. The proposed techniques are applied on images of scattered and heaped rice grains of different varieties. It is shown that each variety gives a unique set of results. © 2017 SPIE.,Convexity calculation; Geometrical parameters; Least square ellipse fitting; Pixel-Distance Contribution Function (PDCF); Scattered and heaped rice grains,Computer vision; Data mining; Geometry; Grain boundaries; Image classification; Image processing; Pixels; Boundary points; Contribution function; Ellipse fitting; Geometrical features; Geometrical parameters; Rice grain image; Rice grains; Skilled workforces; Grain (agricultural product),,Nikolaev D.P.Verikas A.Zhou J.Radeva P.Zhang W.,SPIE,0277786X,9.78151E+12,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029957468

Different analysis can be performed on large document collection with ease only if a short or reduced description can be obtained. Topic modeling offers a promising solution for this. Topic modeling is a method that learns about hidden themes from a large set of unorganized documents. Different approaches and alternatives are available for finding topics, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), neural networks, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), probabilistic LSA (pLSA), probabilistic LDA (pLDA). In topic models the topics inferred are based only on observing the term occurrence. However, the terms may not be semantically related in a manner that is relevant to the topic. Understanding the semantics can yield improved topics for representing the documents. The objective of this paper is to develop a semantically oriented probabilistic model based approach for generating topic representation from the document collection. From the modified topic model, we generate 2 matrices-a document-topic and a term-topic matrix. The reduced document-term matrix derived from these two matrices has 85 similarity with the original document-term matrix i.e. we get 85 similarity between the original document collection and the documents reconstructed from the above two matrices. Also, a classifier when applied to the document-topic matrix appended with the class label, shows an 80 improvement in F-measure score. The paper also uses the perplexity metric to find out the number of topics for a test set. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

An incoming transaction is initially processed by a pattern-matching system in the first stage. This component comprises of a fuzzy clustering module and an address-matching module, and each of them assigns a score to the transaction based on its extent of deviation. A fuzzy inference system computes a suspicious score by combining these score values and accordingly classifies the transaction as genuine, suspicious, or fraudulent. Once a transaction is detected as suspicious, a neural network trained with history transactions is employed in the second stage to verify whether it was an actual fraudulent action or an occasional deviation by the legitimate user.

Sometimes this is a missing data issue, while in other cases it may be inherent, e.g., the records in different geographical databases may actually describe different product ‘SKUs’, or follow different norms for categorization. Often a tedious manual mapping process is often employed in practice. We focus on improving such a process using machine-learning driven automation. Record linkage techniques, such as [5] can be used to automatically map products in different data sources to a common set of global attributes, thereby enabling federated aggregation joins to be performed. Traditional record-linkage techniques are typically unsupervised, relying textual similarity features across attributes to estimate matches. In this paper, we present an ensemble model combining minimal supervision using Bayesian network models together with unsupervised textual matching for automating such ‘attribute fusion’. We present results of our approach on a large volume of real-life data from a market-research scenario and compare with a standard record matching algorithm. Our approach is especially suited for practical implementation since we also provide confidence values for matches, enabling routing of items for human intervention where required. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Competition; Data handling; Enterprise resource management; International trade; Learning systems; Mapping; Sensory analysis; Aggregate analysis; Bayesian network models; Geographical database; Global market share; Human intervention; Product attributes; Product categories; Textual similarities; Data mining,"Gupta, G.; TCS ResearchIndia; email: gupta.garima1@tcs.com",Moon Y.Kang U.Yu J.X.Lim E.-P.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

During keyword auctions, advertisers also tend to target head query keywords, thereby creating an imbalance in demand for head and tail keywords. This leads to under-utilization of ad space of tail query keywords. In this paper, we have explored a mechanism that allows the advertisers to bid on concepts rather than keywords. The tail query keywords are utilized by allocating a mix of head and tail keywords related to the concept. In the literature, an effort has been made to improve sponsored search by extracting the knowledge of coverage patterns among the keywords of transactional query logs. In this paper, we propose an improved approach to allow advertisers to bid on high level concepts instead of keywords in sponsored search.

Whereas this algorithm considers the spatial and temporal distance parameters. Considering the spatiotemporal aspects on migratory data can discover the habitat areas and stopover sites of migrating organisms. Very few works has been carried out that evaluates the temporal aspects of migration data along with the spatial properties. This work can identify the sites of ecological importance and can analyze the spread of pathogenic diseases like avian influenza. It can be used to analyze the influence of human intervention and climate change on the migratory routes of birds and animals.

Compared to the high-resource languages such as English, Chinese, French etc., sentiment analysis task in low-resource language suffers due to (1) absence of annotated corpus, (2) tools to extract features. The present paper derives its motivation and addresses the sentiment analysis task for tweets in Malayalam, a low-resource language. Due to the absence of dataset, 12922 tweets in Malayalam language is collected and annotated to either of three sentiment categories namely positive, negative and neutral. Recently, deep learning methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolution neural network (CNN) have gained popularity by showing promising results for the problems in speech and image processing, tasks in NLP via learning feature rich deep representation from the data automatically.

We propose a self-tuning scheme for large storage filers, on which very little work has been done in the past. Our system uses the performance counters generated by a filer to assess its health in real-time and modify the workload and/or tune the system parameters for optimizing the operational metrics. We use a Pruned Random Forest based solution to predict overload in real-time — the model is run on every snapshot of counter values. Large number of trees in a random forest model has an immediate adverse effect on the time to take a decision. A large random forest is therefore not viable in a real-time scenario. Our solution uses a pruned random forest that performs as well as the original forest. A saliency analysis is carried out to identify components of the system that require tuning in case an overload situation is predicted. This allows us to initiate some ‘action’ on the bottleneck components. The ‘action’ we have explored in our experiments is ‘throttling’ the bottleneck component to prevent overload situations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Feature ordering; Filer; Pruning; Random forest; Self-tuning; Storage; Storage load,Data mining; Decision trees; Digital storage; Energy storage; Feature order; Filer; Pruning; Random forests; Selftuning; Forecasting,"Dheenadayalan, K.; International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: d.kumar@iiitb.org",Cao L.Shim K.Lee J.-G.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.Lin X.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

There is a need to gain insights for such variance in performance and seek opportunities to learn from well performing process variants (e.g., to establish best practices and standardization of processes) and leverage these learnings/insights on non-performing ones.

Nowadays, software companies spend approximately 45% of total cost in maintenance activities. Large software projects maintain bug repositories to collect, organize and resolve bug reports. Sometimes it is difficult to reproduce the reported bug with the information present in a bug report and thus this bug is marked with resolution non-reproducible (NR). When NR bugs are reconsidered, a few of them might get fixed (NR-to-fix) leaving the others with the same resolution (NR). To analyse the behaviour of developers towards NR-to-fix and NR bugs, the sentiment analysis of NR bug report textual contents has been conducted. The sentiment analysis of bug reports shows that NR bugs' sentiments incline towards more negativity than reproducible bugs. Also, there is a noticeable opinion drift found in the sentiments of NR-to-fix bug reports. Observations driven from this analysis were an inspiration to develop a model that can judge the fixability of NR bugs. Thus a framework, NRFixer, which predicts the probability of NR bug fixation, is proposed. NRFixer was evaluated with two dimensions. The first dimension considers meta-fields of bug reports (model-1) and the other dimension additionally incorporates the sentiments (model-2) of developers for prediction. Both models were compared using various machine learning classifiers (Zero-R, naive Bayes, J48, random tree and random forest).

This paper is an effort in that direction where the following techniques have been proposed: (1) a new feature selection technique named term-term correlation has been introduced which reduces the size of the corpus by eliminating noise and redundant features. (2) a novel technique named Support Based Count (SBC) has been proposed which combines with traditional Apriori approach for clustering the Web documents.

These are the two parameters determining the rate at which the customers decide to subscribe with the same organization. Thus higher service quality reduces the chance of customer churn. It involves various attributes to be analyzed and predicted in industries like telecommunication, banking, and financial institutions. Customer churn forecast helps the organization to retain the valuable customers and it avoids failure of the particular organization in a competitive market. Single classifier does not result in higher churn forecast accuracy. Nowadays, both unsupervised and supervised techniques are being combined to get better classification accuracy. Also unsupervised classification plays a major role in hybrid learning techniques. Hence, this work focuses on various unsupervised learning techniques which are comparatively studied using algorithms like Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM), K-Means clustering (K-Means), where similar type of customers is grouped within a cluster and better customer segmentation is predicted. The clusters are divided for training and testing by Holdout method, in which training is carried out by decision tree and testing is done by the model generated.

The problem is challenging because depending on the event type, event mentions could be linked to a single data instance, or to a set of instances. The complexity of the natural language in the reports along with a lack of canonical names or verbose descriptions of the data instances to be linked, add to the difficulties. Given a user-highlighted event mention from a cricket match report, we solve the problem of linking it to a relevant set of balls from the corresponding match commentary. Our approach encodes cricket-specific intuitions broadly into the system design and more specifically as features for multiple classifiers for candidate detection. Further, we leverage techniques such as structured match, context similarity, iterators and sequential proximity of linked entities to perform the linking. Using a dataset of 2828 event mentions across 187 match reports related to 30 matches from the 2011 Cricket World Cup, we show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Sports; Canonical names; Event Types; Iterators; Multiple classifiers; Natural languages; Sequential proximity; World cup; Problem solving,"Gupta, M.; MicrosoftIndia; email: gmanish@microsoft.com",Zimmermann A.Kaytoue M.Davis J.,CEUR-WS,16130073,,,,English,CEUR Workshop Proc.,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034979139

The algorithms for mining association rules identify relationships among transactions using binary values and find rules at a single-concept level or multiple levels. Mining associations among itemsets only by using support and confidence thresholds at different levels of hierarchical data would not give interesting rules both for binary or quantitative data. This paper proposes a two phase algorithm that mines rare generalized fuzzy coherent rules at inter-cross level hierarchies. During phase-I both positive and negative fuzzy coherent rules are mined and in Phase-II, rare generalized fuzzy coherent rules are extracted from the resultant rules obtained from Phase-I. The algorithm framework works on top down methodology in generating positive and negative fuzzy coherent rules and mining rare generalized rules from it. Experiments conducted using synthetic dataset show the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the number of rare generalized rules generated, compared to fuzzy multiple-level association rule mining algorithm. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) is a well-known process which extract data from different sources, transform those data into required format and finally load it into target data warehouse (DW). ETL performs an important role in data warehouse environment. Configuring an ETL process is one of the key factor having direct impact over cost, time and effort for establishment of a successful data warehouse. Conceptual modeling of ETL can give a high-level view of the system activities. It provides the advantage of pre-identification of system error, cost minimization, scope, risk assessment etc. Some research development has been done for modeling ETL process by applying UML, BPMN and Semantic Web at conceptual level. In this paper, we propose a new approach for conceptual modeling of ETL process by using a new standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML). SysML extends UML features with much more clear semantics from System Engineering point of view. We have shown the usefulness of our approach by exemplifying using a use case scenario. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Conceptual model; Data warehouse; ETL; MBSE; SysML,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Data warehouses; Metadata; Risk assessment; Business analysis; Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling of etl process; Extraction transformation loadings; Identification of systems; MBSE; Research development; SysML; Modeling languages,"Mondal, K.C.; Department of Information Technology, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: kartickjgec@gmail.com",Mandal J.K.Dutta P.Mukhopadhyay S.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

The reliability can also be predicted with help of identifying useful patterns and applying that knowledge in constructing the system in a more specified and reliable manner. Prediction of software fault at design level will also be helpful in reducing the overall development and maintenance cost. Authors have classified data on the basis of fault occurrence and identified some of the classification algorithm performance up to 97%. The classification is carried out using different classification techniques available in Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). Classifiers were applied over defect dataset collected from NASA promise repository for different versions of four systems namely jedit, tomact, xalan, and lucene. The defect data set consist of six metrics of CK metric suite as input set and fault as class variable. Outputs of different classifiers are discussed using measures produced by data mining tool WEKA. Authors found Naive Bayes classifier as one of the best classifiers in terms of classification accuracy.

There are several methods that are projected for BLDC to gain better torque and current control, i.e., with minimum torque and current pulsations. The proposed sensorless method is similar to the usual direct torque control method which is utilized for sinusoidal alternating current motors so that it controls toque directly and stator flux indirectly by varying direct axis current.

In this paper, we address the challenges and gaps of offline surveys by mining the public opinions, sentiments and beliefs shared about various religions and communities. Due to the presence of descriptive posts, we conduct our experiments on Tumblr website- the second most popular microblogging service. Based on our survey among 3 different groups of 60 people, we define 11 dimensions of public opinion and beliefs that can identify the contrast of conflict in religious posts. We identify various linguistic features of Tumblr posts using topic modeling and linguistic inquiry and word count. We investigate the efficiency of dimensionality reduction techniques and semi-supervised classification methods for classifying the posts into various dimensions of conflicts. Our results reveal that linguistic features such as emotions, language variables, personality traits, social process, and informal language are the discriminatory features for identifying the dynamics of conflict in religious posts. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Mining user-generated data; Public opinions; Religious conflicts; Semi-supervised learning; Social computing; Text classification; Tumblr,Data mining; Linguistics; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Surveys; Text processing; Public opinions; Religious conflicts; Semi- supervised learning; Social computing; Text classification; Tumblr; User-generated; Classification (of information),"Agarwal, S.; Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-D)India; email: swatia@iiitd.ac.in",Shim K.Lee J.-G.Cao L.Lin X.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Players have multiple roles in a game of cricket, predominantly as bats-men and bowlers. Over the generations, statistics such as batting and bowling averages, and strike and economy rates have been used to judge the performance of individual players. These measures, however, do not take into consideration the context of the game in which a player per-formed. Furthermore, these types of statistics are incapable of comparing the performance of players across different roles. In this paper, we present an approach to quantitatively assess the performances of individual play-ers in single match of One Day International (ODI) cricket. For this, we have developed a new measure, called the Work Index, which represents the amount of work that is yet to be done by a team to achieve its tar-get. Our approach incorporates game situations and the team strengths to measure the player contributions. This not only helps us in evaluat-ing the individual performances, but also enables us to compare players within and across various roles on a common scale. Using the player performances in a match, we predict the player of the match award for the ODI matches played between 2006 and 2016.

Initially the population is created depending on the number of rooms and distribution of subjects with no clashes of a particular professor. The application of genetic algorithm to this domain is divided into 3-phases, which provide timetables that meet the hard constraints during the first phase. In the next phase different sets, which represent population satisfying single soft constraints from group of soft constraints is created and in the last phase we obtain the desired timetable by applying different soft constraints in the form of Set Operations.

The existence of a huge number of symbols and varying characteristics in these languages makes segmentation and extraction of text a challenging task. The Tamil language has a wide variety of the literature, and printed text is available in various forms such as newspaper, books, and magazines. In this paper, extraction of printed Tamil text from an image is done irrespective of the characteristics of the text such as font style, color, and size. The proposed work uses scanned printed Tamil text as the input image. This input image is binarized since text is always available in the foreground, and histograms can be used to segment them into lines and words. The morphological operator, dilation, is used to remove outliers such as dots and commas present in an underlying object and segment the printed text into words to facilitate text detection. Further, each character is identified using bounding box technique. Classification of Tamil letters is done by extracting features such as gradient information and curvature-based information obtained from grayscale and binary images. These features are trained, and characters are classified using Bayesian classifier. The recognized characters are documented as text using Unicode format. The performance of the approach is evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Binarization; Bounding box; Character recognition; Classification; Dilation; Segmentation; Tamil text detection,Artificial intelligence; Binary images; Classification (of information); Data mining; Extraction; Image processing; Image segmentation; Text processing; Binarizations; Bounding box; Bounding box techniques; Dilation; Extracting features; Gradient informations; Morphological operator; Text detection; Character recognition,"Manisha, S.; Department of CSE, SSN College of EngineeringIndia; email: manishas@ssn.edu.in",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The elaborated studies in the past suggest that minimum interesting variables can determine qualified information while preserving information among the data. In addition, it is determined that large scale databases usually comprise of redundant and irrelevant features which have proven to be a major setback for efficient and effective analysis of data. This paper intends to provide an integrated approach by utilising machine learning technique and other convention statistical techniques for extraction of information from large scale databases.

The basic a priori algorithm suffers from multiple database scans, and if the database is large, then the time taken for scanning and generation of candidates is also large. The proposed algorithm attempts to reduce the repeated scanning of the whole database. Using this algorithm, scanning time and also the generation of subitems that are not frequent can be reduced. The former can be done by sorting the transaction records in descending order based on the size of transaction (SOT) and scanning only those transactions whose SOT is greater than or equal to k (size of item sets). The latter can be done by analyzing the item set state. It is not required to generate the next set of candidate item sets using those item sets that are not frequent. Both positive and negative mining has been done in R Studio of the R data mining tool using the R language. Experimental results show that the SOT algorithm performs better than the Apriori, Eclat, PVARM (partition-based validation for association rule mining), and NRRM (nonredundant rule method) algorithms. The work has been tested against various standard datasets such as Adult, Genome, Groceries, and SER (State Electricity Rate) Prediction. The speed-up and efficiency parameter values obtained from the algorithm strongly suggest that the proposed SOTARM algorithm has attained better performance when compared to all the other existing algorithms. © 2017 TÜBITAK.",And confidence; Apriori; Association rules; Item set state; Positive rules; Size of transaction,Association rules; Database systems; Scanning; And confidence; Apriori; Item set state; Positive rules; Size of transaction; Data mining,"Pandian, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sathyabama UniversityIndia; email: ashapandian225@gmail.com",,Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences,13000632,,,,English,Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010735674

Industrial infrastructural needs like storage, computing has became like utilities that uses cloud. Features like availability, scalability, pay per use makes cloud as a dependable choice for enterprises. The growth of cloud computing depends on vital technologies like distributed computing, parallel processing, Internet, virtualization technologies, etc. Virtualization enables resources utilization in efficient way. It offers multi-tenancy which is sharing same physical space by many virtual machines. Co-residency of virtual machine on the other side brings more security bumps. As co-residents share common channels like memory bus, storage controllers, cache these channels can become sources of data leakage for malicious VMs. Malicious attacker VMs use covert channel for accessing sensible data from target VM. This paper presents a novel model Encryption First Split Next (EFSN) model for covert channel protection. This model targets about two key issues like isolating conflict of interest files from attacker using split share model. Other is applying encryption for making attacker difficult even if he gains the data from covert channels. This suggested model gave positive reliable results.

The transfer of knowledge from one domain to another requires similarity between two domains. In many resource-poor languages, it is rare to find labeled training data in both the source and target domains. Active learning algorithms, which query more labels from an oracle, can be used effectively in training the source domain when an oracle is available in the source domain but not available in the target domain. Active learning strategies are subjective as they are designed by humans. It can be time consuming to design a strategy and it can vary from one human to other. To tackle all these problems, we design a learning algorithm that connects transfer learning and active learning with the well-known multi-armed bandit problem by querying the most valuable information from the source domain. The advantage of our method is that we get the best active query selection using active learning with multi arm and distribution matching between two domains in conjunction with transfer learning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by running experiments on three Telugu language domain-specific datasets for sentiment analysis.",Active learning; Multi-arm bandit; Transfer learning,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Active Learning; Active learning strategies; Active-learning algorithm; Labeled training data; Limited training data; Multi-arm bandit; Multi-armed bandit problem; Transfer learning; Learning algorithms,,Polikar R.Sick B.Kottke D.Krempl G.Calma A.Lemaire V.,CEUR-WS,16130073,,,,English,CEUR Workshop Proc.,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030123949

In the preprocessing stage, we have employed median filtering on the input characters and applied normalization and skeletonization method over characters for extraction of boundary edge pixel points. In the feature extraction stage, initially the each character is divided into 3×3 grids and the corresponding centroid for all the nine zones are evaluated. With this we can identify the characters of different styles. There after, we have drawn the horizontal and vertical symmetric projection angel to the nearest pixel of the character which is dubbed as Binary External Symmetry Axis Constellation for unconstrained handwritten character. From which we have calculated the horizontal and vertical Euclidean distance for the same nearest pixel from centroid of each zone. Then we have calculated the mean Euclidean distance as well as the mean angular values of the zones. This is considered as the key feature values of our proposed system.

To address the same, we present the background and propose a code-mixed probabilistic topic model. Unlike the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, it updates the distribution of words to distribution of cross-lingual sets. This results in enhancing LDA to process code-mixed data to generate topic clusters by i) improving the relevance of aspect clusters by restricting insignificant words from inclusion in the clusters and ii) encouraging inclusion of coherent words which are semantically related to each other. This becomes possible by leveraging cross-lingual semantic information from a multilingual dictionary called BabelNet. We call our proposed model as code-mixed semantic LDA (cms-LDA) model. Our results indicate that cms-LDA substantially improves the coherence of aspects in topic clusters as compared to the standard topic modeling counterparts.

The major act to disclose the identity is through exploring the pattern of attributes involved in data formation. The existing benchmarking models are anonymizing the data either by generalizing, deleting the sensitive attributes, or adding noise to the data. Either of these approaches is not guaranteed in optimality and accuracy in results that obtained from the mining models applied on that data set. The deviation in results often causes falsified decision-making, which is unconditionally not acceptable in certain domains like health mining. To fill the gap, here, we proposed a novel hybridization of feature set partitioning and data restructuring to achieve the pattern anonymization. The model is particularly aimed to restructure the data for supervised learning. To the best of our knowledge, pattern anonymization is first of its kind that attempted to anonymize the patterns rather individual attributes.

Feature selection is an important factor that boosts-up the classification accuracy. In this paper we have proposed a adaptive feature selector based on game theory and optimization approach for an investigation on the improvement of the detection accuracy and optimal feature subset selection. Particularly, the embedded Shapely Value includes two memetic operators namely include and remove features (or genes) to realize the genetic algorithm (GA) solution. The use of GA for feature selection facilitates quick improvement in the solution through a fine tune search. An extensive experimental comparison on 22 benchmark datasets (both synthetic and microarray) from UCI Machine Learning repository and Kent ridge repository of proposed method and other conventional learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), J48 (C4.5) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) confirms that the proposed SVEGA strategy is effective and efficient in removing irrelevant and redundant features. We provide representative methods from each of wrapper, filter, conventional GA and show that this novel memetic algorithm – SVEGA yields overall promising results in terms of the evaluation criteria namely classification accuracy, number of selected genes, running time and other metrics over conventional feature selection methods. © 2016",Biomedical classification; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Medical data mining; Performance evaluation,Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Filtration; Game theory; Genes; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Medical computing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Optimization; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Feature selection methods; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Medical data mining; Optimal feature selections; Optimal feature subset selections; Performance evaluation; Supervised classification; UCI machine learning repository; Classification (of information),"Sasikala, S.; K.L.N.

The existing algorithms for association rule mining are not completely capable in dealing with these uncertainties. In the present paper a fuzzy soft fuzzy approach is proposed for mining amino acid associations in molecular sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). The data consisting of peptide sequences of MTBC is transformed into fuzzy transactional dataset using the fuzzy set. The soft set is employed to transform fuzzy transactions into soft fuzzy transactions. The fuzzy set is again employed to transform soft fuzzy transaction into fuzzy soft fuzzy transactions. The association rule mining is performed to generate amino acid association patterns. It is observed that the proposed approach prunes the spurious patterns and recovers the missing patterns obtained by the existing approaches. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,Association rule; Confidence; Data mining; Fuzzy set; Fuzzy-soft-fuzzy set; Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex; Soft set; Support; Transaction; Uncertainty,,"Jain, A.A-1006, Vraj Green Valley, Kolshet Road, India; email: amita.jain01@gmail.com",,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,17485673,,,,English,Int.

To overcome the ambiguity and impreciseness, Zadeh [20] introduced fuzzy set theory in the year 1965. The underlying power of fuzzy sets is that linguistic variables can be used rather than quantitative variables to represent imprecise concepts which are continuous transitions. The continuous imprecise concepts need to be modeled by continuous fuzzy numbers instead of intervals and real numbers. Many researchers applied triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which are piecewise linear and continuous for imprecise concepts because of its convenience and ease. But imprecise variables in the fields of decision making, data analysis, fuzzy control, image processing, fuzzy clustering etc., need not be linear always. So parabolic fuzzy numbers can be used for modeling nonlinear fuzzy concepts to have a better accuracy in real life problems. Since parabolic fuzzy numbers are not completely studied till now and the triangular fuzzy numbers have been thoroughly studied, triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers may be used as supplementary tool along with parabolic fuzzy numbers. Approximation is a kind of de-fuzzification that has to change non-linear functions into linear functions which reduces the fuzziness for the undefined information and produces a better accuracy. So the study of approximation of parabolic fuzzy numbers is necessary and hence, in this paper, the problem of triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers is attempted using distance function in terms of ?-cuts. Some properties of the parabolic fuzzy numbers which are useful in multi criteria decision making (MCDM) have also been discussed. Finally pertinent illustrations and applications of the approximation of parabolic fuzzy number have also been given. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Reliability of the whole system depends on the stability and consistency of its decision-making unit. Real-time decision making is another challenge in the field on which the research community has been focusing on improving the performance of the underlying models. The underlying models are usually the learning models, that act as a smart engine after being sufficiently trained for the process. In this paper, we propose to use a decision tree model that has the capability of handling uncertainty in the acquired data from the environment. The resulting model is called as Fuzzy Granular Decision Tree (FGDT). Series of evaluation of FGDT shows that the model is stable and powerful for the presently considered problem.

Prediction of defect in software system in the initial stage may be favourable to a great extend in the process of finding out defects and making the software system efficient, defect-free and improving its over-all quality. To analyze and compare the work done by the researchers on predicting defects of software system, it is necessary to have a look on their varied work. The most frequently used methodologies for predicting defects in the software system have been highlighted in this paper and it has been observed that use of public datasets were considerably more than use of private datasets.

Publishing data in many fields like banking, medical, political, research, etc., by preserving one’s privacy is very important. Apart from preserving privacy, anonymity of the publisher must be preserved. To achieve these objectives in this paper, multidimensional k-anonymity with onion routing and mix-network methods are proposed to preserve privacy and to provide anonymous communication. Mix-net is a multistage system which accepts quantities of data on input batch and produces cryptographically transformed data through output batch. Output batch is a permutation of the transformed input batch, to achieve untraceability between the input and output batches. Mix-net can change the appearance and random reordering which prevents trace back. In onion routing encryption, data is encapsulated in layers of encryption, which is analogous to layers of onion. The data is being sent to transmit inside the several layers of encryption. The final node or exit node in the chain is to decrypt and deliver the data to the recipient by applying multidimensional kanonymity on collected data. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Anonymity; Data; Distributed; Hierarchical; Mix-network; Onion routing; Personal information; Privacy; Ring; Vertically partitioned,Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Data mining; Network routing; Publishing; Rings (components); Anonymity; Data; Distributed; Hierarchical; Mix networks; Onion routing; Personal information; Vertically partitioned; Data privacy,"Srinivas, R.; Department of CSE, ACETIndia; email: viceprincipal@acet.ac.in",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Data mining techniques like association rule mining, classification and clustering is implemented to analyze the different types of disease. Classification is an important problem in Data mining. Given a database contains a collection of records, each with a single class label, a classifier performs a brief and clear definition for each class that can be used to classify successive records. Data mining plays an important role in medical systems. It is used to discover the knowledge out of data and presenting it in the form that human can easily understand. It is a cooperative effort of humans and computers. There are two primary goals of data mining - Prediction and Description. Prediction involves some variables or fields in the data set to predict unknown or future values of other variables of interest. Description focuses on finding patterns describing the data that can be interpreted by humans. It is very useful for predicting diseases such as Heart disease, Lung disease. Lung cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world. The early detection of lung cancer can cure the disease completely. Data mining plays an effective role by using Naïve Bayes and Artificial Neural Network to massive volume of healthcare of data. The health care industry collects huge amounts of data which unfortunately are not mined to find the hidden data. The Naïve Bayes aims at delivering robust classifications also when dealing with small or incomplete data sets. The aim of the paper is to detect and diagnose the lung diesases as early as possible which will help the doctor to save the patient’s life.

Till now, there is no standardized, exhaustive, and dynamic stop word list created for documents written in Indian Gujarati language which is spoken by nearly 66 million people worldwide. Most of the existing stop words removal approaches are file or dictionary based, wherein a hard-coded static, nonstandardized, and individually created list of stop words is used. The existing approaches are time consuming and complex owing to file or dictionary preparation by collecting possible stop words from a large vocabulary, complex framework and a morphologically variant Gujarati document. Even the other proposed approaches in the literature are also very restricted due to their dependence on word-length, word-frequency, and/or training data set. For the first time in scientific community worldwide, this paper proposes a dynamic approach independent of all factors namely usage of file or dictionary, word-length, word-frequency, and training dataset. An 11 rule-based approach is presented focusing on automatic and dynamic identification of a complete list of Gujarati stop words. Extensive empirical evidence has been presented through deployment of proposed algorithm on nearly 600 Gujarati documents, categorized into routine and domain-specific categories. The respective results with 98.10 and 94.08% average accuracy show that the proposed approach is effective and promising enough for implementation in NLP tasks involving Gujarati written documents. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Gujarati; Natural language processing (NLP); Rule-based approach; Stop word,Computation theory; Data mining; Intelligent computing; Linguistics; Dynamic approaches; Dynamic identification; Gujarati; NAtural language processing; Rule-based approach; Scientific community; Stop word; Training data sets; Natural language processing systems,"Rakholia, R.M.; School of Computer Science, R K UniversityIndia; email: rajnish.rakholia@gmail.com",Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Then, in the test phase, we employ LSI on the query documents from the positive class to compare them with the SVs extracted from the negative class and match score is computed using the cosine similarity measure. Then, based on a prespecified threshold for the match score, we classify the positive category of the text corpus.

The frequent pattern growth (FP-growth) algorithm introduced compact prefix-based data structure, frequent pattern tree (FP-Tree), to store frequent itemsets in compressed format. The FP-growth attempts to overcome drawback of candidate generation approach of multiple database scan. This work aims to propose a novel optimised data structure multipath-Graph (MP-Graph) for improving memory utilisation and efficiency of mining algorithms. The MP-Graph is a compact graph structure to store frequent patterns in memory. It generates graph nodes equal to number of frequent 1-itemsets of transaction database. Further, it stores multiple occurrences of prefix subpaths along the edges of the graph in the form of transaction bitmap instead of storing frequency of individual item node. The proposed structure helps to mine frequent patterns without constructing conditional FP-Trees. The performance of the MP-Graph mining algorithm is compared with FP-growth, CT-PRO and IFP-growth. The experimental results show order of magnitude improvement in memory consumption to store frequent patterns, nodes generated and time complexity.

For Cluster analysis technique, mainly the K-mean clustering algorithm is executed through the Hadoop and MapReduce to analyse high dimensional datasets. In big data analytics, the clustering is done when the unlabelled information is handled and used to group clusters of the information. Also when it is examined by the conventional k-means algorithm does not works well with the Hadoop framework and MapReduce programming in this manner it is mandatory to change the algorithm so as to improve the performance on the data analysing techniques.

The occurrence of chronic illness is rare in the population and the effect of this class imbalance, on the performance of various classifiers was studied. The objective of this work is to identify the best classifiers for class imbalanced health datasets through a cost-based comparison of classifier performance. The popular, open-source data mining tool WEKA, was used to build a variety of core classifiers as well as classifier ensembles, to evaluate the classifiers"" performance. The unequal misclassification costs were represented in a cost matrix, and cost-benefit analysis was also performed. In another experiment, various sampling methods such as under-sampling, over-sampling, and SMOTE was performed to balance the class distribution in the dataset, and the costs were compared. The Bayesian classifiers performed well with a high recall, low number of false negatives and were not affected by the class imbalance. Results confirm that total cost of Bayesian classifiers can be further reduced using cost-sensitive learning methods. Classifiers built using the random under-sampled dataset showed a dramatic drop in costs and high classification accuracy. Copyright © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

But, the retesting of test cases during regression testing increases the testing time and leads to delayed delivery of the software product. In this paper, a dynamic model, i.e. UML state chart diagram, is used for system modelling. Further, the UML state chart diagram is converted into an intermediate representation, i.e. State Chart Graph (SCG). The SCG is traversed to identify the affected nodes due to certain modification in the software. This information, about the affected nodes, is periodically stored in a historical data store across different versions of the software. Next time, when regression testing is carried out for any change, the stored data decides the pattern of frequently affected nodes for prioritizing the test cases and further it decides the criticality value (CV) of a test case. Along with this, to strengthen the prioritization the test sequence, two more criteria, i.e. priority set by the end-user for different functions and browsing history of the end-user, are also added up. This approach is found to be very efficient as we are able to model dynamic nature of applications, maintain a historical data store of the test cases and track the complete life of an object. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Prioritization; Regression testing; State chart diagram; State chart graph; UML model,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Regression analysis; Testing; Unified Modeling Language; Prioritization; Regression testing; State chart diagrams; State charts; UML Model; Software testing,"Panda, N.; School of Computer Engineering, KIIT UniversityIndia; email: npandafcs@kiit.ac.in",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Clustering is one of the Data Mining tools that help us to analyze Big Data effectively. Existing algorithms have high computational complexity and they do not perform well especially when it comes to Big Data. Since most of the data is unstructured a graph based spectral technique using power method is chosen for analysis. The algorithm is made more effective by making them to converge using extrapolation technique. Moreover, they are designed to handle larger datasets using MapReduce framework.

Feature selection is an important dimensionality reduction technique as it improves accuracy, efficiency and model interpretability of data mining algorithms. Selection of feature and its stability may be perceived to be the robustness of the algorithm for feature selection which helps selecting similar or the same subset of features for small perturbations in the dataset. The essential purpose of data mining that is used for the preservation of privacy is the modification of original datasets by means of a method to preserve privacy of the individuals and work out subsequent data mining algorithm to get information from it.

Efficient query composition and data organization are necessary for getting effective results.

This research proposes a Funnel Mesh-5 algorithm (FM5) to construct a search string taking into account context of information need and user intention with three main steps 1) Predict user intention with user profiles and the past searches via weighted mesh structure 2) Resolve ambiguity and polysemy of search strings with context and user intention 3) Generate a personalized disambiguated search string by query expansion encompassing user intention and predicted query. Experimental results for the proposed approach and a comparison with direct use of search engine are presented.

However, in contrast to the traditional approaches of named entity identification, the present system extracts hidden attributes associated with each of the characters (e.g., character adjectives). We observed distinct phrase level linguistic patterns that hint the presence of characters in different text spans. Such six patterns were used in order to extract the characters. On the other hand, a distinguishing set of novel features (e.g., multi-word expression, nodes and paths of parse tree, immediate ancestors etc.) was employed. Further, the correlation of the features is also measured in order to identify the important features. Finally, we applied various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.) along with deep learning to classify the patterns as characters or non-characters in order to achieve decent accuracy. Evaluation shows that phrase level linguistic patterns as well as the adopted features are highly active in capturing characters and their adjectives. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

In this work, a novel association rule-mining algorithm is employed for finding various rules for performing valid prediction. Various traditional association mining algorithms has been studied carefully and a new mining algorithm, Treap mining has been introduced which remedies the drawbacks of the current Association Rule Learning (ARL) algorithms. Treap mining is a dynamic weighted priority model algorithm. As it works on dynamic priority, rule creation happens in least time complexity and with high accuracy. When comparing with other association mining algorithms like Apriori and Tertius, we could see that Treap algorithm mines the database in an O(n log n) when compared to Apriori’s O (en) and Tertius’s O (n2). A high precise mining model for the post Liver Transplantation survival prediction was designed using the rules mined by Treap algorithm. United Nations Organ Sharing dataset was used for the study. Rule accuracy of 96.71% was obtained while using Treap mining algorithm where as, Tertius produced 92% and Apriori created 80% valid results. The dataset has been tested in dual environment and significant improvement has been noted for Treap algorithm in both cases. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Apriori Algorithm; Association mining; Priority model; Survival prediction; Treap algorithm,Association rules; Big data; Forecasting; Apriori algorithms; Association mining; Large amounts of data; Liver transplantation; Novel associations; Priority model; Rule mining algorithms; Survival prediction; Data mining,"Anand Hareendran, S.; Department of Computer Science, MITSIndia; email: anandhareendrans@mgits.ac.in",Takagi H.Shi Y.Tan Y.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The collection of labeled samples is a costly affair and many semi-supervised classification methods are introduced that can make use of unlabeled samples for training. Due to the nature of these images, high dimensional spectral features must be distinctive with preservation of absorption band in mineral mapping. We propose the method in which we consider the band parameters of the spectral data combined with the neighborhood spatial information for mineral classification using Active Labeling to compensate for the lack of a large number of labeled samples.

Earlier prediction of the fault-prone software modules enables timely correction of the faults and delivery of reliable product. Generally, the fuzzy logic, decision tree and neural networks are deployed for fault prediction. But these techniques suffer due to low accuracy and inconsistency. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a spiral life cycle model-based Bayesian classification technique for efficient software fault prediction and classification. In this process, initially the dependent and independent software modules are identified. The spiral life cycle model is used for testing the software modules in each life cycle of the software development process. Bayesian classification is applied to classify the software modules as faulty module and non-faulty module, by using the probability distribution models. Robust similarity-aware clustering algorithm performs clustering of the faulty and non-faulty software modules based on the similarity measure of the features in the dataset. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed method enables accurate prediction and classification of the faulty modules. The proposed technique achieves higher accuracy, precision, recall, probability of detection, F-measure and lower error rate than the existing techniques. The misclassification rate of the proposed technique is found to be lower than the existing techniques. Hence, the reliability of the software development process can be improved. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bayesian classification; Robust similarity-aware clustering (RSC) algorithm; Segregate fault prediction algorithm; Software development; Spiral life cycle model; Spiral life cycle model-based Bayesian classification technique (SLMBC),Algorithms; Clustering algorithms; Computer software; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Life cycle; Probability distributions; Software engineering; Software reliability; Software testing; Bayesian classification; Fault prediction algorithms; Life cycle model; Misclassification rates; Probability distribution model; Probability of detection; Software development process; Software fault prediction; Software design,"Chinna Gounder Dhanajayan, R.; Department of Computer Science, PERI Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: cdrajaganapathy@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983406934

The data is exploited to make informed choices, predict marketplace trends and patterns in consumer preferences. Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous after the penetration of internet services among the masses. The idea is to make use of filtering and clustering techniques to suggest items of interest to users. For a media commodity like movies, suggestions are made to users by finding user profiles of individuals with similar tastes. Initially, user preference is obtained by letting them rate movies of their choice. Upon usage, the recommender system will be able to understand the user better and suggest movies that are more likely to be rated higher. The experiment results on the MovieLens dataset provides a reliable model which is precise and generates more personalised movie recommendations compared to other models.

Cognitive devices have the similar proficiency of CR and the expedient network that they form dynamically is called cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs). Due to assorted qualities in channels, routing becomes a critical undertaking job in CRAHN. Minimizing the end-to-end delay is one of the major difficult tasks in CRAHNs, where the transmission of packets passes on every hop of routing path. In this paper, a new reactive multicast routing protocol namely cuckoo search inspired protocol (CSIP) is proposed to reduce the overall end-to-end delay, which progressively reduces the congestion level on various routing path by considering the spectrum accessibility and the service rate of each hop in CRAHNs. Simulations are demonstrated using NS2 tool and the results proved that the proposed routing protocol CSIP significantly outperforms better than other baseline schemes in minimizing end-to-end delay in CRAHNs. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Bio-inspired; Cognitive; CRAHN; CSIP; Cuckoo; Radio; Routing,Ad hoc networks; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Network routing; Optimization; Radio; Routing protocols; Bio-inspired; Cognitive; CRAHN; CSIP; Cuckoo; Routing; Cognitive radio,"Ramkumar, J.; Department of Computer Science, VLB Janakiammal College of Arts and Science (Affiliated to Bharathiar University)India; email: jramkumar1986@gmail.com",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Recently, the performance of sentiment classification is achieved success using neural networks. In this paper, neural network approach is presented to detect the sentiment from audio and text models. For audio, features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used to build Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Deep Neural Network Attention Mechanism (DNNAM) classifiers. From the results, it is noticed that DNNAM gives better results compared to DNN because the DNN is a frame based one where as the DNNAM is an utterance level classification thereby efficiently use the context. Additionally, textual features are extracted from the transcript of the audio input using Word2vec model. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) classifiers are used to develop a sentiment model. From the experiments it is noticed the LSTM-RNN outperforms the SVM as the LSTM-RNN is able to memorize long temporal context. The performance is also significantly improved by combining both the audio and text modalities. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Deep neural networks; DNNAM; LSTM-RNN; MFCC; Multimodal sentiment analysis; SVM; Word2vec,Data mining; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Recurrent neural networks; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; DNNAM; LSTM-RNN; MFCC; Sentiment analysis; Word2vec; Deep neural networks,"Abburi, H.; Langauage Technology Research Center, International Institute of Information Technology HyderabadIndia; email: harika.abburi@research.iiit.ac.in",Pal R.Ghosh A.Prasath R.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Traditional conventional methods and evolutionary bio-inspired methods are applied for detecting hard clusters. In most of the real time problems, identification and analysis of hard clusters is impossible or may not be suitable for further analysis and prediction. It leads the requirement for soft clustering identification using fuzzy. The paper proposes about one such fuzzy soft clustering model using V(variation)-level to remove sharp crisp boundaries between clusters. The proposed V-level fuzzy clustering algorithm is capable of handling mixed type data items as well.

A search engine should regulate its query completion suggestions by detecting and filtering such queries as it may hurt the user sentiments or may lead to legal issues thereby tarnishing the brand image. Hence, automatic detection and pruning of such inappropriate queries from completions and related search suggestions is an important problem for most commercial search engines. The problem is rendered difficult due to unique challenges posed by search queries such as lack of sufficient context, natural language ambiguity and presence of spelling mistakes and variations. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based technique for automatically identifying inappropriate query suggestions. We propose a novel deep learning architecture called “Convolutional Bi-Directional LSTM (C-BiLSTM)” which combines the strengths of both Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Bi-directional LSTMs (BLSTM). Given a query, C-BiLSTM uses a convolutional layer for extracting feature representations for each query word which is then fed as input to the BLSTM layer which captures the various sequential patterns in the entire query and outputs a richer representation encoding them. The query representation thus learnt passes through a deep fully connected network which predicts the target class. C-BiLSTM doesn’t rely on hand-crafted features, is trained end-end as a single model, and effectively captures both local features as well as their global semantics. Evaluating C-BiLSTM on real-world search queries from a commercial search engine reveals that it significantly outperforms both pattern based and other hand-crafted feature based baselines. Moreover, C-BiLSTM also performs better than individual CNN, LSTM and BLSTM models trained for the same task. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",CNN + Bi-directional LSTM; Deep learning; Query auto suggest; Query classification; Supervised learning; Web search,Convolution; Data mining; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Semantics; Supervised learning; Websites; Bi-directional; Convolution neural network; Fully connected networks; Learning architectures; Query auto suggest; Query classification; Query representations; Web searches; Search engines,"Yenala, H.; IIIT HyderbadIndia; email: harish.yenala@research.iiit.ac.in",Shim K.Lee J.-G.Cao L.Lin X.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

At unsignalized intersections, crossing drivers have to accept or reject the available gap. The gap acceptance decision is influenced by different dynamics such as traffic, geometric, environmental and human factors. The decision to cross the major road largely depends on the speed, distance and the heaviness of the potentially conflicting vehicle on the major road. The driver's gap acceptance data was collected at 4-legged unsignalized intersections. The information such as the type of crossing vehicle, conflicting vehicle, speed and the spatial gap was extracted from the video data. This paper deals with the application of three widely used non-parametric data mining techniques, namely, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RF) and Decision Trees (DT) to predict the gap acceptance behaviour of the driver. While SVMs are insensitive to class imbalance, decision tree generated by CART algorithm provides critical insights into decision making process employed by the driver. Random forests and decision tree implicitly establish the relative importance of different factors affecting the driver's decision. Further, skill scores used to validate the models revealed that SVM and DT models performed almost similarly whereas, RF model outperformed SVM and DT. © 2017 The Authors.

Linear array FODS with weighted sum (FODSWS) is also studied for the performance improvisation. The mathematical replica for the study of intensity modulated fibers, inclined with some angle is developed. It is found the performance parameters of the developed sensor are controlled by different geometrical parameters of the sensor. The model is obtained for sensor consisting of group of fibers, termed as fiber optic bundle displacement sensor (FOBDS) using a ray tracing method. The sensor performance for different geometries like, concentric, random and hemispherical fiber bundle configurations is simulated by means of the generated model. The experimental and simulated results of fiber optic bundle displacement sensor (FOBDS) shows that hemispherical configuration is best for FODS and it shows improvement in sensor performance with respect to two fiber sensor. A scheme of linear array based self-referenced fiber optic displacement sensor with weighted sum (FODSWS) is reported for simultaneous improvement on both linear displacement range and sensitivity. Simulations for linear array based self-referenced FODSWS was carried out. An effect of weight factors applied to each receiving fiber in second receiving group on sensor performance is investigated. Experimentation for linear array based self-referenced FODSWS was also carried out. Sensitivity is increased 5.2 times in comparison with simple self-referenced FODS. Linear displacement range also increased 1.05 times. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Image thresholding being a simple and effective technique, mostly used for image segmentation and these thresholds are optimized by optimization techniques by maximizing the Tsallis entropy. However, as the two level thresholding is extended to multi-level thresholding, the computational complexity of the algorithm is further increased. So there is need of evolutionary and swarm optimization techniques. In this paper, first time optimal thresholds are obtained by maximizing the Tsallis entropy using novel adaptive cuckoo search algorithm (ACS). The proposed ACS algorithm performance of image segmentation is tested using natural and standard images. Experiments shows that proposed ACS is better than particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cuckoo search (CS). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Cuckoo search; Differential evolution; Image segmentation; Image thresholding; Tsallis entropy,Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Data mining; Entropy; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Algorithm performance; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Differential Evolution; Image thresholding; Multilevel thresholding; Optimization techniques; Tsallis entropies; Image segmentation,"Naidu, M.S.R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, AITAMIndia; email: msrnaidu312@rediffmail.com",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

While existing works on utility mining have primarily focused on the problem of finding high-utility itemsets from transactional databases, they implicitly assume that each item occupies only one slot. However, in many real-world scenarios, the number of slots consumed by different items typically varies. Hence, this paper considers that a given item may physically occupy any fixed (integer) number of slots. Thus, we address the problem of efficiently determining the top-utility itemsets when a given number of slots is specified as input. The key contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we present an efficient framework to determine the top-utility itemsets for different user-specified number of slots that need to be filled. Second, we propose a novel flexible and efficient index, designated as the STUI index, for facilitating quick retrieval of the top-utility itemsets for a given number of slots. Third, we conducted an extensive performance evaluation using real datasets to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the proposed indexing scheme in terms of execution time and utility (net revenue) as compared to a recent existing scheme. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Index; Top utility itemsets; Utility mining,Data mining; Indexing (of information); High utility itemsets; Index; Indexing scheme; Item sets; Overall effectiveness; Real-world scenario; Transactional database; Utility mining; Big data,"Chaudhary, P.; Shiv Nadar UniversityIndia; email: pc230@snu.edu.in",Sureka A.Chakravarthy S.Reddy P.K.Bhalla S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

They are the most common forms of dementia. It involves the degeneration of neurons in the brain cells. Diagnosis of these diseases at an early stage is said to be a challenging task and currently there exist no preprocessed database to explore the genetic role of these neuro-degenerative disorders. Hence the performance of data mining methods in extracting relevant genes that cause these neuro-degenerations is also reported to be limited. This paper targets the extraction of protein properties that are specific to AD and PD. The data is constructed and a comparative study on the performance of data mining techniques in extracting the protein properties that characterize these two ailments is investigated. The dataset is obtained by retrieving the genes related to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease from KEGG database. The existing data mining algorithms give a classification accuracy of around 93% with Correlation-based subset selection method. It is believed that further exploration of computational methods to investigate the role of genetic variants in causing neuro-degenerations can help identify AD and PD early. Moreover, once the genetic cause is identified, suitable drugs to target the specific gene property can well pave way towards providing cure or at least partial relief to the suffering patients.",Alzheimer’s disease; Feature selection; Parkinson’s disease; PROFEAT; UniProt,Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Genes; Proteins; Alzheimer; Binary classification; Classification accuracy; Data mining algorithm; Data mining methods; Parkinson; PROFEAT; Uniprot; Data mining,,Castillo O.Douglas C.Ao S.I.Feng D.D.Korsunsky A.M.,Newswood Limited,20780958,9.78988E+12,,,English,Lect.

Traditional Hadoop-based distributed decision tree models such as Probability based decision tree (PDT), Classification And Regression Tree (CART) and Multiclass Classification Decision Tree have failed to discover relational patterns, user-specific patterns and feature-based patterns, due to the large number of feature sets. These models depend on selection of relevant attributes and uniform data distribution. Data imbalance, indexing and sparsity are the three major issues in these distributed decision tree models. In this proposed model, an enhanced attributes selection ranking model and Hadoop-based decision tree model were implemented to extract the user-specific interesting patterns in online biomedical databases.

Visually challenged persons are the persons who are either blind or having any kind of difficulty in reading any printed material to acquire the domain knowledge. A lot of research is being done for visually challenged to make them independent in their life. We want to study the existing assistive technology for visually challenged and then propose a robust reading framework for visually challenged. The discussed reading framework will help the visually challenged person to read normal printed books, typed documents, journals, magazines, newspapers and computer displays of emails, Web pages, etc., like normal persons. It is a system based on image processing and pattern recognition using which visually challenged person carries or wears a portable camera as a digitizing device and uses computer as a processing device. The camera captures the image of the text to be read along with the relevant image and data. An optical character recognition (OCR) system segregates the image into text and non-text boxes, and then, the OCR converts the text from the text boxes to ASCII or text file. The text file is converted to voice by a text-to-speech (TTS) converter. Thus, blind person would ‘hear’ the text information that has been captured. So this technology can help the visually challenged to read the captured textual information independently which will be communicated as voice signal output of a text-to-speech converter. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Assistive technology; OCR and TTS; Reading framework; Visually challenged,Artificial intelligence; Cameras; Character sets; Data mining; Image processing; Network function virtualization; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Websites; Assistive technology; Domain knowledge; Optical character recognition (OCR); Printed materials; Processing device; Reading framework; Textual information; Visually challenged; Character recognition,"Verma, A.; BBD UniversityIndia; email: avinash.verma93@yahoo.com",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

A substantial part of this data is unstructured text such as reviews and blogs. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (OMSA) as a research discipline has emerged during last 15 years and provides a methodology to computationally process the unstructured data mainly to extract opinions and identify their sentiments. The relatively new but fast growing research discipline has changed a lot during these years. This paper presents a scientometric analysis of research work done on OMSA during 2000–2016. For the scientometric mapping, research publications indexed in Web of Science (WoS) database are used as input data. The publication data is analyzed computationally to identify year-wise publication pattern, rate of growth of publications, types of authorship of papers on OMSA, collaboration patterns in publications on OMSA, most productive countries, institutions, journals and authors, citation patterns and an year-wise citation reference network, and theme density plots and keyword bursts in OMSA publications during the period. A somewhat detailed manual analysis of the data is also performed to identify popular approaches (machine learning and lexicon-based) used in these publications, levels (document, sentence or aspect-level) of sentiment analysis work done and major application areas of OMSA.

Indian Premier League (IPL), a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in India, has established itself as one of the biggest tournaments in cricket history. In this paper, we propose a model to predict the winner at the end of each over in the second innings of an IPL cricket match. Our methodology not only incorporates the dynamically updating game context as the game progresses, but also includes the relative strength between the two teams playing the match. Estimating the relative strength between two teams involves modeling the individual participating players' potentials. To model a player, we use his career as well as recent performance statistics. Using the various dynamic features, we evaluate several supervised learning algorithms to predict the winner of the match. Finally, using the Random Forest Classifier (RFC), we have achieved an accuracy of 65:79%-84:15% over the course of second innings, with an overall accuracy of 75:68%.",Cricket; Player modeling; Sports analytics; Supervised learning; Winner prediction,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Sports; Supervised learning; Cricket; Dynamic features; Overall accuracies; Player modeling; Random forest classifier; Recent performance; Relative strength; Second innings; Learning algorithms,,Zimmermann A.Kaytoue M.Davis J.,CEUR-WS,16130073,,,,English,CEUR Workshop Proc.,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035014074

Sentimental feedbacks of learners posted at the end of many of these contents may be considered as genuine reactions of the learners who have gone through the contents. Such learners' sentiments are important inputs for judging the acceptability of a learning material. Analyzing such feedbacks using sentiment analysis techniques can identify the best reusable learning contents that may be used for developing new courseware. This can significantly reduce the time and effort of authoring, which is otherwise a difficult, time-consuming, and costly affair. This methodology can also be used for continuous assessment on the learning materials released for use. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for emotion analysis in e-learning materials. It describes the design and experimental use of a sentiment analysis classifier that uses classifier combination rules to combine polarity scoring and a support vector machine (SVM). The present approach also gives an opportunity for users to train a lexicon on a very specialized set of data, pertaining to the domain of usage. This helps either to enhance polarity scores of certain words that appear more frequently or to add words that are completely missing from the lexicon, and contributes a great deal in determining the polarity scores. © TÜBÏTAK.",Feedback analysis; Hybrid classifier; Opinion mining; Polarity scoring; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines,Computer aided instruction; Data mining; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Feedback analysis; Hybrid classifier; Opinion mining; Polarity scoring; Sentiment analysis; Learning systems,"Mandal, L.; Department of Information Technology, Institute of Engineering and ManagementIndia; email: mandal.lopa@gmail.com",,Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences,13000632,,,,English,Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020753312

Efficient AUC optimization is a challenging research problem as the objective function is non-decomposable and non-continuous. Using a max-margin based surrogate loss function, AUC optimization problem can be approximated as a pairwise RankSVM learning problem. Batch learning algorithms for solving the kernelized version of this problem suffer from scalability issues. Therefore, recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the development of online or single-pass algorithms that design a nonlinear classifier by maximizing the AUC performance. However, on many real-world datasets, the AUC performance of these classifiers was observed to be inferior to that of the classifiers designed using batch learning algorithms. Further, many practical imbalanced data classification problems demand fast inference, which underlines the need for designing sparse nonlinear classifiers. Motivated by these observations, we design a scalable algorithm for maximizing the AUC performance by greedily adding the required number of basis functions into the classifier model. The resulting sparse classifier performs faster inference and its AUC performance is comparable with that of the classifier designed using batch mode. Our experimental results show that the level of sparsity achievable can be an order of magnitude larger than that achieved by the Kernel RankSVM model without significantly affecting the AUC performance.

In two-sided platforms, the users can have two personas, consumers who would like relevant and diverse recommendations, and creators who would like to receive exposure for their creations. If the new creators do not get adequate exposure, they tend to leave the platform, and consequently, less content is generated, resulting in lower consumer satisfaction. We propose a re-ranking strategy that can be applied to the scored recommendation lists to improve exposure distribution across the creators (thereby improving the fairness), without unduly affecting the relevance of recommendations provided to the consumers. We also propose a different notion of diversity, which we call representative diversity, as opposed to dissimilarity based diversity, that captures level of interest of the consumer in different categories. We show that our method results in recommendations that have much higher level of fairness and representative diversity compared to the state-of-art recommendation strategies, without compromising the relevance score too much. Interestingly, higher diversity and fairness leads to increased user acceptance rate of the recommendations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Consumer satisfactions; Exposure distribution; Level Of Interest; Re-ranking; Recommendation strategies; Relevance score; Two-sided platforms; User acceptance; Data mining,"Modani, N.; BigData Experience Lab, Adobe ResearchSwitzerland; email: nmodani@adobe.com",Cao L.Shim K.Lee J.-G.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.Lin X.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Because of non-deterministic web access behavior of web clients, web user session data is usually noisy and imperfect. Such imperfection has a negative impact on pattern discovery process. One of the real issues associated with the prevalently used Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) and Fuzzy c-Medoids (FCMdd) methods is that they are not robust against the noise, because a single outlier object could lead to a very different clustering result. In this research we propose a robust Fuzzy c-Least Medians (FCLMdn) clustering framework to deal with the user session data contaminated with noise and outlier user session objects, with the objective of improving the quality of the extracted patterns. To deal with the high dimensionality of user session data which may contain noise and outliers, a fuzzy set theoretic approach for assigning fuzzy weights to user sessions and associated URLs has been proposed. Our results clearly indicate that quality of user session clusters formed using FCLMdn algorithm is much better than those using FCM and FCMdd algorithms in terms of various cluster validity indices. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

Such data are preferably archived and transmitted in the compressed form to realize storage and transmission efficiency. Through compression, though data becomes storage and transmission efficient, its processing gets expensive as it requires decompression as many times the data needs to be processed; and this requires additional computing resources. Therefore it would be novel, if the data processing and information extraction could be carried out directly from the compressed data without subjecting it to decompression. In this backdrop, the research paper demonstrates a novel technique of extracting text and non-text information straight from compressed document images (supported by TIFF and PDF formats) using the correlation-entropy features that are directly computed from the compressed representation. The experimental results reported on compressed printed text document images validate the proposed method, and also demonstrate the fact that the text and non-text information extracted from the compressed document are identical to that obtained from uncompressed representation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Compressed document processing; Correlation-entropy; Run-length compresseddomain; Text and non-text,Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Entropy; Image processing; Information analysis; Intelligent systems; Automatic extraction; Compressed datum; Compressed domain; Computing resource; Document-processing; Novel techniques; Text and non-text; Transmission efficiency; Image compression,"Javed, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NMAM Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: javedsolutions@gmail.com",Mezzour G.Alimi A.M.Rokbani N.Abraham A.Muda A.K.Haqiq A.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78332E+12,,,English,Adv.

Data mining techniques have allowed regimented discovery of knowledge from huge databases. Conversely, in the case of sharing the data with others, knowledge discovery raises the possibility of revealing the sensitive knowledge. The need of privacy prompted the growth of numerous privacy-preserving data mining techniques. In order to deal with privacy concerns, the database is to be transformed into another database in such a way that the sensitive knowledge is concealed. One subarea of privacy-preserving data mining, which got attention in retail businesses, is privacy-preserving association rule mining. A significant feature of privacy-preserving association rule mining is attaining a balance between privacy and precision, which is characteristically conflicting, and refining the one generally reduces the other one. In this paper, the problem has been planned in the perspective of protecting association rules which are sensitive by prudently amending the transactions of the database. To moderate the loss of non-sensitive association rules and to improve the quality of the transformed database, the proposed approach competently estimates the impact of an alteration to the database. The proposed method selects the transactions for alterations using the binary TLBO optimization technique during the concealing process. Experimental outcomes exhibit the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Association rule mining; Data sharing; Optimization; Privacy; Sanitization; Sensitive knowledge; TLBO,Association rules; Bins; Computation theory; Data mining; Database systems; Intelligent computing; Optimization; Data Sharing; Optimization techniques; Privacy preserving; Privacy preserving data mining; Sanitization; Sensitive association rules; Sensitive knowledge; TLBO; Data privacy,"Kalyani, G.; Acharya Nagarjuna UniversityIndia; email: kalyani4work@gmail.com",Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Udgata S.K.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The primary ensemble information matrix generated in the traditional cluster ensemble approaches results only the cluster data point relations with unknown entries. This paper mainly denotes the improved analysis of the Link based Cluster Ensemble (LCE) approach which overcomes the problem of degrading the quality of clustering result and in particular it presents an efficient novel Weighted Delta Factor Cluster Ensemble algorithm (WDFCE) which enhances the refined matrix by augmenting the values of similitude measures between the clusters formed in the Bipartite cluster graph. Subsequently to obtain the final ultimate cluster result, the pairwise-similarity consensus method is used in which K-means clustering technique is applied over the similarity measures that are formulated from the Refined Similitude Matrix (RSM). Experimental results on few UCI datasets and synthetic dataset reveals that this proposed method always outperforms the traditional cluster ensemble techniques and individual clustering algorithms. © 2017, Zarka Private University.

Even though many physicochemical parameters are available for monitoring the water quality, the knowledge of domain experts are expected to analyze these parameters to find the final decision about the quality of water. In order to utilize the knowledge of the domain experts for water quality artificially, we have developed a functional tangent decision tree algorithm which, predict the water quality of the ponds based on the physiochemical parameters. The proposed method of predicting the water quality consists of three important steps such as, uncertainty handling, feature selection using reduct and core analysis, classification using the functional tangent decision tree. The proposed functional tangent decision tree is constructed by utilizing a new function called functional tangent entropy for the selection of attributes and split points. Then, the proposed work is experimented with the real database and compared with the existing classifiers to prove its better performance. The proposed work obtained the maximum classification accuracy of 95 as compared with the existing work. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

In this paper, to provide suggestions for a given combination of forecasted and observed values, we have proposed a framework to exploit reuse of the suggestions which have been prepared for the past combinations of observed and forecasted values over the years. We define the notion of coupled weather condition (CWC) which represents the weather conditions of two consecutive durations for a given combination of weather variables. By employing the domain-specific categories, the proposed framework exploits the reuse of CWCs for the given domain. We have applied the proposed framework by considering the case study of agromet advisory service of India Meteorological Department (IMD). The extent of reuse has been computed by considering 30 years of weather data from Rajendranagar, Hyderabad, Telangana State, based on the weather categories data provided by IMD. The reuse over 30 years is computed by considering the period of year and crop seasons of a year. Period is defined as portion of time of the year(s) that is considered to analyze the similarity. The results are very positive. The results show that the percentage of reuse of CWCs with three weather variables for the period of year is about 77% after five years.

Contact centers conduct periodic analysis of these chats to measure customer satisfaction, of which the chat emotion forms one crucial component. Typically, these measures are performed at chat level. However, retrospective chat-level analysis is not sufficiently actionable for agents as it does not capture the variation in the emotion distribution across the chat. Towards that, we propose two novel weakly supervised approaches for detecting fine-grained emotions in contact center chat utterances in real time. In our first approach, we identify novel contextual and meta features and treat the task of emotion prediction as a sequence labeling problem. In second approach, we propose a neural net based method for emotion prediction in call center chats that does not require extensive feature engineering. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed methods by empirically evaluating them on a real-life contact center chat dataset.

However, generalized representation learning approaches do not capture the task specific subtleties. In addition, often the computational model for each task is developed in isolation, overlooking the interrelation among certain NLP tasks. Given that representation learning typically requires a good amount of labeled annotated data which is scarce, it is essential to explore learning embedding under supervision of multiple related tasks jointly and at the same time, incorporating the task specific attributes too. Inspired by the basic premise of multi-task learning, which supposes that correlation between related tasks can be used to improve classification, we propose a novel technique for building jointly learnt task specific embeddings for emotion and sentiment prediction tasks. Here, a sentiment prediction task acts as an auxiliary input to enhance the primary emotion prediction task. Our experimental results demonstrate that embeddings learnt under supervised signals of two related tasks, outperform embeddings learnt in a uni-tasked setup for the downstream task of emotion prediction. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Emotion prediction; Joint learning; Multi-tasking; Representation learning,Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Auxiliary inputs; Computational model; Emotion predictions; Feature engineerings; Joint learning; Learning approach; Multitask learning; Representation learning; Forecasting,"Sen, A.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, IIT DelhiIndia; email: anirban@cse.iitd.ac.in",Cao L.Shim K.Lee J.-G.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.Lin X.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

A number of high performing texture algorithms are based on the concept of local binary patterns (LBP) characterising the relationships of pixels to their local neighbourhood. LBP descriptors are simple to calculate, are invariant to intensity changes and can be calculated in a rotation invariant manner as well as at different scales. Incorporating variance information, leading to LBP variance (LBPV) texture descriptors, has been claimed to lead to more versatile and more effective texture features. In this paper, we investigate this in more detail, benchmarking and contrasting the classification performance of several LBP and LBPV descriptors for generic image texture classification as well as two medical tasks.

B2B setup is different from B2C setup in many ways. Along with the contrasting buying entity (company vs. individual), there are dissimilarities in order size (few dollars in e-commerce vs. up to several thousands of dollars in B2B), buying cycle (few days in B2C vs. 6–18 months in B2B) and most importantly a presence of multiple decision makers (individual or family vs. an entire company). Due to easy availability of the data and bargained complexities, most of the existing literature has been set in the B2C framework and there are not many examples in the B2B context. We present a unique approach to model next likely action of B2B customers by observing a sequence of digital actions. In this paper, we propose a unique two-step approach to model next likely action using a novel ensemble method that aims to predict the best digital asset to target customers as a next action. The paper provides a unique approach to translate the propensity model at an email address level into a segment that can target a group of email addresses. In the first step, we identify the high propensity customers for a given asset using traditional and advanced multinomial classification techniques and use non-negative least squares to stack rank different assets based on the output for ensemble model. In the second step, we perform a penalized regression to reduce the number of coefficients and obtain the satisfactory segment variables. Using real world digital marketing campaign data, we further show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional classification methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",B2B; Digital; Ensemble; Literature survey; Multi-class classification; Next-best action; Non-negativity constraint; Regression; Robustness,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data mining; Education; Electronic commerce; Electronic mail; Learning systems; Marketing; Robustness (control systems); Sales; Digital; Ensemble; Literature survey; Multi-class classification; Next-best action; Non-negativity constraints; Regression; Pattern recognition,"Bhandari, A.; VMware Inc.United States; email: anitb@vmware.com",Perner P.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

This is regardless of the fact that whether the news is regarding a parliamentary election, or a famous entertainment celebrity. Moreover, these platforms allow people to like, retweet and comment on the shared news article. This shapes the opinions and beliefs of the people who read it along with the news article itself. However, a major problem we face today is the misuse of these networks for spreading rumors and misleading news content. This is the practice of yellow journalism which aims at disrupting public sentiment. To address this problem, we present a methodology to find credible and relevant tweets that refer to actual news articles published on news websites. Our methodology scores each tweet based on the reputation of the users sharing it, the news publisher which published the news article, and the popularity of the news concepts mentioned in the article. We model the interaction between these three entities in the form of a tripartite graph and propose a Co-HITS algorithm based formulation to score all the entities involved. The scores of individual entities is used to assign a score for each tweet that indicates the credibility and relevance of the news mentioned in it. We find that the presence of many bots is also a big problem in these networks and can affect the results of such explorations. Thus, we use existing bot detection techniques to identify bots and propose an approach to limit their influence on the system in an efficient manner. Finally, we present a qualitative evaluation of our proposed system on a set of approximately 8000 tweets. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Credibility; Data mining; News; Social networks; Twitter; User profiling,Botnet; Data mining; Social networking (online); Credibility; News; Parliamentary elections; Public sentiments; Qualitative evaluations; Tripartite graphs; Twitter; User profiling; Big data,"Garg, A.; Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: ankurgarg101@gmail.com",Sureka A.Chakravarthy S.Reddy P.K.Bhalla S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The enormity and high dimensionality of datasets typically available as input to problem of association rule discovery, makes it an ideal problem for solving on multiple processors in parallel. The primary reasons are the memory and CPU speed limitations faced by single processors.

Discovering periodic patterns in temporal databases has numerous applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has considered mining periodic patterns in temporal databases where items have dissimilar support and periodicity, despite that this type of data is very common in real-life. Discovering periodic patterns in such non-uniform temporal databases is challenging. It requires defining (i) an appropriate measure to assess the periodic interestingness of patterns, and (ii) a method to efficiently find all periodic patterns. While a pattern-growth approach can be employed for the second sub-task, the first sub-task has to the best of our knowledge not been addressed. Moreover, how these two tasks are combined has significant implications. In this paper, we address this challenge. We introduce a model to assess the periodic interestingness of patterns in databases having a non-uniform item distribution, which considers that periodic patterns may have different period and minimum number of cyclic repetitions. Moreover, the paper introduces a pattern-growth algorithm to efficiently discover all periodic patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and the proposed model may be utilized to find prior knowledge about event keywords and their associations in Twitter data. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Data mining; Non-uniform temporal database; Periodic pattern,Database systems; Cyclic repetition; Interestingness; Non-uniform; Pattern growth; Periodic pattern; Prior knowledge; Temporal Database; Time stamps; Data mining,"Kiran, R.U.; Institute of Industrial Science, The University of TokyoJapan; email: uday_rage@tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp",Cao L.Shim K.Lee J.-G.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.Lin X.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

This data is further used by decision making systems to infer a patient's condition and possibly to motivate a patient to follow a healthy lifestyle by using persuasive system approach. The implementation and maintenance of such systems require specific attention of software engineers for data management because of the complexity involved in the management of various data sources and privacy-related issues of personal data. In this paper, we propose a data model that is generic enough to describe and to support many kinds of telemonitoring applications. These applications include data mining applications which analyse and combine sensor data for a decision making, and persuasive systems which motivate a patient to follow a healthy lifestyle. We show that our data model is useful for a smooth management of data mining outputs and that it avoids the integration efforts in dealing with heterogeneous storage mechanisms.

In the present manuscript concept of intrusion detection system (IDS) were discussed along with its types and basic approaches. It is found that signature analysis, expert system, data mining etc. still using for IDS. Survey was given related to cybercrime incidents across various industry sectors. After analyzing the attacks on networks of organizations in different industry sectors it is found that still attacks like DDoS are not preventable. Comparison of data mining algorithms used for intrusion detection was also done. Various methods to implement the algorithm along with the advantages and disadvantages were also discussed in detail. Because of the disadvantages like over fitting, slow testing speed, unstable algorithms etc., intruders in the network are still active. To avert these shortcomings there is a need to develop real-time intrusion detection and prevention system through which data/information can be protected and saved in real-time basis before a severe loss is experienced. The real-time prevention is possible only if alerts are received instantly without delays. For this purpose, process mining could be used.

A goal model can be viewed as a composition of a number of goal refinement patterns that relate parent goals to subgoals. In this paper, we offer a means for mining these patterns from enterprise event logs and a technique to leverage vector representations of words and phrases to compose these patterns to obtain complete goal models. The resulting machinery can be quiote powerful in its ability to mine know-how or constitutive norms.

In the literature, pattern growth-based approaches to mine PFPs have be proposed by considering a single machine. In this paper, we propose a Map-Reduce framework to mine PFPs by considering multiple machines. We have proposed a parallel algorithm by including the step of distributing transactional identifiers among the machines. Further, the notion of partition summary has been proposed to reduce the amount of data shuffled among the machines. Experiments on Apache Spark’s distributed environment show that the proposed approach speeds up with the increase in number of machines and the notion of partition summary significantly reduces the amount of data shuffled among the machines. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Data mining; Map-Reduce; Periodic frequent pattern mining,Data mining; Distributed environments; Frequent pattern mining; Map-reduce; Multiple machine; Pattern growth; Single- machines; Transactional database; Big data,"Anirudh, A.; Kohli Center on Intelligent Systems, IIIT - HyderabadIndia; email: alampally.anirudh@research.iiit.ac.in",Bellatreche L.Chakravarthy S.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Having too many ordinary but too few rare samples as training data, will mislead the classifier to become over-fitted by learning too much from majority class samples and become under-fitted lacking recognizing power for minority class samples. In this research work, a novel rebalancing technique that under-samples (reduce by sampling) the majority class size for subsiding the imbalanced class distributions without synthesizing extra training samples, is studied. This simple method is called Similarity Majority Under-Sampling Technique (SMUTE). By measuring the similarity between each majority class sample and its surrounding minority class samples, SMUTE effectively discriminates the majority and minority class samples with consideration of not changing too much of the underlying non-linear mapping between the input variables and the target classes. Two experiments are conducted and reported in this paper: one is an extensive performance comparison of SMUTE with the states-of-the-arts using generated imbalanced data; the other is the use of real data representing a case of natural disaster prevention where accident samples are rare. SMUTE is found to be working favourably well over other methods in both cases. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Imbalanced classification; Similarity measure; SMUTE; Under-Sampling,Data mining; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Soft computing; Event prediction; Imbalanced class; Imbalanced classification; Nonlinear mappings; Performance comparison; Similarity measure; SMUTE; Under-sampling; Classification (of information),"Fong, S.; Department of Computer Information Science, University of MacauMacau; email: ccfong@umac.mo",Mohamed A.Yap B.W.Berry M.W.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.
