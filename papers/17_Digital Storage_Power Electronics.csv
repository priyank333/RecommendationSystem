Dashcam, being one of the car video storage devices, stores the data in the SD card which is overwritten and can be tampered very easily. Thus, it is important to develop an in-car security system, where data can be stored in the server and can provide privacy to the user. In this paper, we have proposed a noise-resilient compressed domain video watermarking system for in-car security to document the vehicle history which can be a proof for any mischief. We have used Independent Pass Coding (INPAC) compression technique for designing the system. Here, data generated by the system is stored in the server database which is accessible to the authentic registered user and administrator in case of any claim. This system ensures copyright, proprietorship, authentication and security against third party intrusion. The proposed system is implemented in off-line mode to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, and in online mode to verify the system.

The cloud computing fulfills the need of store and oversee show. Though to get to and secure information, numerous exceptional advancements like parallel and guide diminish strategies are accessible. The burden of usage from maintenance and storage of native data is eliminated and the owner additionally benefits from elimination of the responsibility of security and storage (Gourkhede and Theng, 2014 fourth international conference on communication systems and network technologies (CSNT), pp 677–680, 2014; Modi, J Supercomput 63(2):561–592, 2013; Smys and Bala, Clust Comput 15(3):211–222, 2012). In order to ensure modification of the accuracy of the on-demand data and its due verification on the cloud owners’ behalf, a methodology that is innovative is needed. The encryption and file split up is done using a novel secure cryptography hashing algorithm. Once the data is uploaded the user is provided with a private and public key for trustworthy retrieval of the data file. Those keys are generated using a proposed modified RSA cryptosystem algorithm. A multilevel hash tree algorithm is used to efficiently audit the data file occasionally.

This study examines an entity attribute value style modeling approach for standardized Electronic Health Records (EHRs) database. It sustains qualities of EAV (i.e., handling sparseness and frequent schema evolution) and provides better performance for queries in comparison to EAV. It is termed as the Two Dimensional Entity Attribute Value (2D EAV) model. Support for ad-hoc queries is provided through a user interface for better user-interaction. 2D EAV focuses on how to handle template-centric queries as well as other health query scenarios. 2D EAV is analyzed (in terms of minimum non-null density) to make a judgment about the adoption of 2D EAV over n-ary storage model of RDBMS. The primary aim of current research is to handle sparseness, frequent schema evolution, and efficient query support altogether for standardized EHRs. 2D EAV will benefit data administrators to handle standardized heterogeneous data that demands high search efficiency. It will also benefit both skilled and semi-skilled database users (such as, doctors, nurses, and patients) by providing a global semantic interoperable mechanism of data retrieval. © 2018 by the authors.","Archetype based EHRs; Electronic Health Records (EHRs); Entity attribute value model; Standardization","Digital storage; Efficiency; Health; Information management; Query processing; Records management; Semantics; Standardization; User interfaces; Archetype based EHRs; Attribute values; Data administrators; Electronic health record (EHRs); Existing systems; Heterogeneous data; Search efficiency; Semantic interoperability; Search engines","Sachdeva, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology UniversityIndia; email: shelly.sachdeva@jiit.ac.in",,"MDPI AG",20782489,,,,"English","Information",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040114764

This is achieved through reduction in battery size. The framework uses HOMER to model microgrids that are cost optimized for a given CS and installation location. As the first step of the redesign, load prioritization is used to resize the system into a new configuration, termed as Default System Size (DSS). The battery size in DSS is subsequently optimized over second and third stages of design. The second stage, Battery Threshold Management (BTM) uses efficiencies brought about by setting battery thresholds using load information for a 24-hour autonomy. In the third step - Prediction Management (PM), the operational efficiency brought about by solar generation prediction data is incorporated into the design framework. The proposed framework is validated using 6 individual microgrids set in different rural Indian locations. © 2017 IEEE.","battery storage; capacity shortage; design optimization; forecasting; load prioritization; Microgrid design; renewable energy sources","Battery storage; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Capacity shortage; Design optimization; Load prioritization; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Battery management systems","Rajan, G.; Solarillion FoundationIndia; email: gandhi.rajan@ieee.org",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509060467,,,"English","GHTC - IEEE Glob.

The cryptographic technique is one of the possible solutions for protecting digital information for unauthorized uses. In this technique, the encryption algorithm should be simple to design and implementation. In the proposed article, a novel color image encryption algorithm is presented employing a 4D Lorenz system. The encryption technique is very sensitive to the input 256 bits key and input plane image. Initially, the color image is split into three different channels R, G, and B. Next each channel is encrypted separately by employing diffusion and confusion mechanism. Finally, all three channels R, G, and B are combined to produce the required encrypted image. Various security tests have been conducted to prove the validity of the presented encryption technique. The encryption time was considerably less as compared to other reported works. © 2017 IEEE.","chaos; decryption; encryption; information entropy; noise attack; NPCR & UACI","Artificial intelligence; Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Digital storage; Image processing; Color image encryptions; Cryptographic techniques; decryption; Design and implementations; Encryption algorithms; Hyper-chaotic systems; Information entropy; noise attack; Cryptography",,"Piuri V.Mukherjee A.Mondal A.Das A.Maulik U.Bhattacharjee D.Bhaumik H.Panigrahi B.K.Gandhi T.Bhattacharyya S.Pan I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538619315,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

All these multimedia services have high computational, bandwidth, and storage requirements. Therefore, multimedia cloud computing has gained appreciable popularity and acceptance in the past one decade. The convenience of cloud computing comes with financial burden. One of the fundamental features of cloud computing, which helps in reducing the financial worries of the multimedia service providers is the cloud’s pay-as-you-go pricing model. However, the cloud’s pricing model has also attracted adversaries that have hindered the migration of services and/or data by various organisations to the cloud. Through the cloud’s pay-as-you-go pricing model, attackers usually target the financial viability of the cloud customers. Therefore, such attacks are capable to affect the long term availability of multimedia-services hosted on the public cloud. These attacks are known as Fraudulent Resource Consumption (FRC) attack. Therefore, research in the area of FRC attack detection and mitigation is important in motivating the organisations to adopt the public cloud platform. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on network flow analysis at the victim side to detect and mitigate the FRC attacks against cloud-based services. Experiments were conducted using real world benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental outcomes suggest that our proposed approach is able to detect and mitigate the FRC attacks with satisfactory accuracy and low overhead. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Cloud pricing model; Cloud security; EDoS attack; Fraudulent Resource Consumption (FRC) attacks; Low rate DDoS attacks; Multimedia cloud; Network flow analysis; Turing test","Benchmarking; Cloud computing; Costs; Denial-of-service attack; Digital storage; Finance; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Network security; Cloud securities; DDoS Attack; EDoS attack; Network flow analysis; Pricing models; Resource consumption; Turing tests; Distributed computer systems","Gupta, B.B.; National Institute of Technology KurukshetraIndia; email: gupta.brij@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038631544

Compression methods which are capable of maintaining high quality information for important parts without any significant loss prove as useful techniques in such cases. Medical images contain large amount of data and need compression for efficient storage and communication purposes. On the other hand medical images also have a few diagnostically important regions where loss of quality could result in wrong interpretation which cannot be tolerated. Thus compression techniques which provide both lossless as well as lossy compression in different areas of the same image can provide a solution for the medical community. As digital images are in matrix form we have developed a mathematical approach for applying both lossless and lossy compression on the same image. Mathematical operations like matrix subtraction, addition, multiplication and other matrix operations can help to achieve the result of maintaining high quality at the region of interest (ROI) and allow high degree of compression in other regions. Here we have achieved the two objectives of reducing the storage and transmission time as well as retaining the original quality at the ROI successfully. © 2017 IEEE.","Compression techniques; Matrix mathematical operations; Region of interest; Wavelet compression","Digital storage; Image segmentation; Matrix algebra; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Compression methods; Compression techniques; High quality information; Mathematical approach; Mathematical operations; Region of interest; The region of interest (ROI); Wavelet compression; Image compression",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

A strong encryption system is required to protect the data stored in android phones at a maximum level. Traditional encryption schemes have the disadvantage that communication overheads and the computation costs are too high. And also there is a possibility that the data is lost after encryption. Hence, it is necessary to implement a ""Data Encryption and Decryption"" scheme with ""Cloud Backup"" feature which is more efficient in order to provide high level of data security for android phones. It is necessary to create means which will enable a user to encrypt confidential data present in the mobile phones. Decrypt it to recover the encrypted data. In case of brute force attack, user need not worry about losing the data as ""Automatic encryption"" is triggered. ""Cloud Backup"" is another mechanism to prevent the data from being known by an adversary. This paper proposes an Android Application which will provide the features of automatic encryption, data encryption/decryption, and cloud backup all in one single mobile application. AES -256 bit algorithm is used for this purpose. The sole purpose of using AES for encryption/decryption is that it is secure and has high computational complexity. Due to this the intruder will require comparatively more time to decrypt the data. © 2017 IEEE.","AES (Advanced Encryption Standards)","Android (operating system); Authentication; Digital storage; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Telephone sets; Advanced Encryption Standard; Android applications; Authenticated encryption; Brute-force attack; Communication overheads; Encryption schemes; Encryption/decryption; Mobile applications; Cryptography",,"Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509064717,,,"English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Several research works have been presented in the past to address email spoofing attack. Further, in recent years, the technique of memory forensics has evolved significantly where critical evidence is extracted from the volatile memory of the target machine during a cyber crime investigation. In this paper, we utilize memory forensics to detect if the client received any spoofed email. In addition, our memory forensics approach detects if the client replied to any spoofed emails. The memory of the client machine is acquired on a scheduled basis and the acquired memory dump is analyzed to identify spoofing attack and, if detected, storing the details in log files that can be used by cyber crime investigators.

It considered as one of the widely accepted technologies worldwide. During these days people to avoid the expense of IT infrastructure and maintenance they are started adopting the cloud services. When we choose cloud service security is most significant obstacle and data security is biggest hurdle in case of security. When data is store on servers it may store directly or with encryption of whole data. But we know data have different characteristics and needs so different security levels are required. So in this paper we review some classification algorithms to classify the data on basis of their different security needs. After classification which part required more security that can be encrypted by various cryptographic techniques and then store it over the cloud whereas other part can store directly without any encryption on cloud storage. For further security we can partition the cloud storage. And this will help us to overcome the security issue i.e. confidentiality and also save our efforts and time of encryption and uploading of data over data storage. It prevents the data leakage also because after classification hacker will also not able to know the starting and ending point of data and it will also difficult for him to hack multiple storage than single.

Cost and time over run of projects occur due to delay in communication. Despite of being one of the oldest industries, construction industry is still fragmented. Transferring and updating of information takes place repeatedly between different phases among different stake holders throughout the project lifecycle. Cloud Computing (CC) is a recent IT advancement which can be used as an effective tool to alleviate these issues. Cloud computing technology offers a good platform for sharing, accessing and storing of huge data involved in construction projects. Using CC, an individual can access and share information at any time and place via internet. The main objective of this research is to study and explore cloud computing technology as a tool to improve collaboration and communication in supply chain management. The traditional method of data storage and information transfer has its own limitations. Many construction projects are being delayed and there is a huge variation of planned and actual cost of construction. The factors which lead to these effects are very minor and if managed efficiently, we can achieve expected results using cloud computing. Many researchers have stated that deployment of cloud computing in construction process can improve communication and coordination, as well as mitigate delays and disputes.

This technique works by installing sensors in the field to monitor the soil temperature, moisture and type of soil, which transmits the data to the microcontroller for estimation of accurate quantity of water as per the requirements. The collected data is updated from time to time to the server and can be accessed via an Android app. The subsequent watering of plants can be controlled using the aforementioned app. Depending upon the type of soil and crop, the fertilizers are suggested by applying Naïve Bayes algorithm on the database.

Not only storage, but high speed read and writes of the data is also essentially important for performance. Cloud Computing, now a days, solves this problem and gives the most efficient solutions especially for storage and computing needs. Though different cloud service providers offer different services, but the challenges of cost effective storage of data and its fast retrieval still remains an objection. Several different solutions are available for meeting this problem, yet there is a provocation to make these solutions more effective. There are some algorithms for segmentation and filtering of databases, but when the question comes to large data sets (for example data storage and processing for billions of rows) the performance is however compromised. This paper discusses the main concerns that relate to the effective filtering, storage and segmentation of the data. Focus is placed on the software application (IOTA) which is being developed by us which is intended to addresses all the stated concerns and how different modules in the software work together to deliver seamless service. © 2017 IEEE.","API; big-data; cloud; data storage; filtering; GCP (Google Cloud Platform); LibPhone; NoSQL; segmentation; servers","Application programs; Clouds; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Digital storage; Filtration; Image segmentation; Servers; Cloud platforms; Cloud service providers; Cost-effective storages; Data storage; Different services; LibPhone; NoSQL; Software applications; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043071,,,"English","Int.

This has led to need for powerful and large data centers, where huge number of storage and computing servers are interconnected. According to the reports, annual data center traffic is growing at a very high growth rate of 25%, of which the major contribution is due to the servers within the data centers, i.e. Intra datacenters. The traffic outside the data center is handled by high-speed optical fiber network. However, within the datacenter the data is handled by both optical and electrical interconnects. It is essential that the fully network infrastructure is made optical to cater to the future needs. To fulfill the intra- and inter-system bandwidth requirements of data centers and HPC (high-performance computers). Though the server racks are connected through active optical cables, the server boards are still fully electrical, i.e. the optical-electrical conversion is done at the board edge. This conversion leads to bandwidth limitations at the server board. In this work we proposed to extend the optical reach to the processing unit i.e., microprocessors and memory unit from board edge. This is achieved by designing an OEPCB (Optical-Electrical Printed Circuit Board) using laser direct writing and to define high-speed optical waveguide. In this work, we target to demonstrate an on-board waveguide technology that can support data rate of 10 Gbps/channel.

Microgrids incorporate large amount of non conventional and conventional distributed generation (DG) that are connected to the system either directly or through power electronics (PE) interface. To utilize maximum amount of renewable energy, energy management controller has been developed by researcher earlier but later it is found that they are inefficient. As they controls the supply side and demand side depending on total power generated and consumed without assigning any priority to supply the load. Battery will continuously supply all type of load without considering its state of charge and power generated. An energy management system (EMS) is a system used by operators of electric utility grids to monitor, control, and optimize the performance of the transmission and generation system. The EMS leads to savings in the overall operating cost. Due to use of power electronics devices issues related to power quality becomes severe. Power quality of microgrid is maintain by using compensating devices like unified Power Quality Controller (UPQC). In this paper energy management of DC microgrid is done along with maintaining its power quality by using UPQC.

There are a lots of existing techniques of searchable encryption scheme over the years. But, the practical significance of those techniques are not up to expectation. Nevertheless, it is an important tool regarding storing the data and retrieving from cloud server. For this, the scheme is gaining more attention in recent years. Searchable encryption was practically introduced by Boneh et al., who used asymmetric searchable encryption in their scheme. There are lots of techniques of searchable encryption based on single and multiple keyword search. The multiple keyword search was first attempted by Wang et al. However, the scheme has some drawbacks. Searchable encryption with patter obfuscation was introduced by Orencik et al. This scheme has also some shortcomings regarding security issues. In our work, we devised a searchable encryption scheme with pattern matching algorithm for multiple keywords. The scheme is designed with less space complexity and it also provides updating ranked search. We use the property of Trie data structure to reduce both the search and space complexity. Our scheme allows the ranked search with outcomes of most relevant top ranked documents which consists of the query keyword. Because of the Trie structure property, our scheme also deals with the update operation of files or documents flexibly.

However, renewable energy sources are intermittent in nature that creates imbalance in the grid and affects the electric grid reliability. Deploying energy storage therefore plays a pivotal role in maintaining the reliability and efficient integration of renewable energy sources in the grid. Thus, it is important to optimally schedule the energy storage desired to be connected to the grid so that it would maximize the economic benefits. This paper presents a nonlinear programming approach (NLP) to optimally schedule the daily strategy of operation of the connected energy storage device. To maximize the economic benefits of the hybrid energy system, the energy demand, the market price and operational constraints are considered forming an optimization problem on hourly basis. The optimization problem is solved using NLP approach through General Algebraic Modelling software (GAMS) which is an efficient and fast platform for solution of complex optimization problems.

Cassandra is a NoSQL database that stores data in non-related tabular forms. Cassandra works on 'query at a time' and 'query at a table' concept. In our daily life the queries of a user are related to each other. If queries by a user are related, that is, the current query is related to the previous query, then there is no support in Cassandra to state this. Cassandra runs each query on the entire table because Cassandra has neither memory to remember the result of a previous query, nor supports VIEW or JOIN on tables (or keyspace). Cassandra uses Big Table (of Google) for data storage which has thousands of columns and millions of rows, so it is not efficient to run the query on such a huge table, after knowing that the result of the previous query is sufficient to answer our current query. To solve such problems of Cassandra database, we implemented a new query language named as 'Context Based Cassandra Query Language'. CBCQL is internally mapped to Cassandra Query Language (CQL) so it has the same power as Cassandra, but provides additional functionality of querying on result of previous query. In this paper, CBCQL is explained with examples. © 2017 IEEE.","big data; Cassandra; CBCQL; CQL; database; JOIN; NoSQL; query language; VIEW","Big data; Data handling; Data storage equipment; Database systems; Digital storage; Joining; Query languages; Search engines; Cassandras; CBCQL; Large scale data; Non-Relational Databases; NoSQL; Nosql database; Parallel data processing; VIEW; Query processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509030385,,,"English","Int.

Development of a suitable power electronic interface is most essential for integrating these sources with very less number of components. Nowadays, it is very much essential to stabilize the output voltage of DC/DC converters in order to ensure maximum efficiency and better performance. This paper deals with the design of a suitable control strategy for multi-input DC/DC converter. To achieve this objective, two different control techniques i.e. PI and One-Cycle control have been adopted. Finally, the transient as well as steady state analysis have been done for both the control techniques with the help of MATLAB/Simulink platform and performance comparison has been performed.

Ubiquitous dynamic memory management techniques in virtualized systems are centralized at the hypervisor and are ineffective in nested derivative cloud setups. In this paper, we highlight the challenges in management of memory resources in derivative cloud systems. Hypervisor caching, an enabler of centralized disk cache management, provides flexible memory or non-volatile memory management at the hypervisor to improve the resource usage efficiency and performance of applications. Existing hypervisor caching solutions have limited effectiveness in nested setups due to their nesting agnostic design, centralized management model and lack of holistic view of memory management. We propose DoubleDecker, a decentralized disk caching framework, realized through guest OS and hypervisor cooperation, with support for efficient memory management in derivative clouds. The DoubleDecker hypervisor caching framework, an integral part of our proposed solution, provides interfaces for differentiated cache partitioning and management in nested setups and is equipped to handle both memory and SSD based caching stores. We demonstrate the flexibility of DoubleDecker to handle dynamic and changing memory provisioning requirements and its capability to simultaneously provision memory across multiple levels. Such multi-level configurations cannot be explored by centralized designs and are a key feature of DoubleDecker. Our experimentation with DoubleDecker demonstrates that application performance can be consistently improved due to the flexible policy framework for disk caching. With our setup, we report an average performance improvement of 4x and a maximum of 11x. © 2017 ACM.",,"Application programs; Cost effectiveness; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Disks (machine components); Middleware; Storage allocation (computer); Application performance; Cache partitioning; Centralized management; Dynamic memory management; Efficiency and performance; Non-volatile memory; Software-based services; Virtualized systems; Cache memory",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450347204,,,"English","Middlew. - Proc.

To maintain the confidentiality, many researchers suggested cryptographic techniques to protect data against malevolent attackers in order to preserve data confidentiality. It is observed from various studies, a groundbreaking security system is required to maintain cloud data confidentiality, as the existing techniques are not adequate to protect data stored in Cloud storage. This paper proposes a Cryptographic Cloud Storage Algorithm (CCSA) namely, Enhanced Advanced Encryption Standard (EnAES) to ensure confidentiality of cloud stored data. The proposed CCSA is a symmetric encryption algorithm with data partition and data shuffling mechanisms. Same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Keys for EnAES CCSA are generated from cloud. EnAES CCSA takes less time for encrypting and decrypting date when compared to the existing AES algorithm. EnAES allows users to encrypt data with high security. The dynamic-S-box of Enhanced-substitute stage enhances the security level in the proposed CCSA. The Enhanced-MixColumns stage helps to reduce the execution time. Ciphertext produced by EnAES CCSA is not easily hacked by the illegitimate users.

Since virtualization is the foundational element of cloud computing and helps to achieve the benefits of cloud computing, security from virtualization becomes a major goal for the cloud based systems. Virtualization aims to create virtual versions of resources such as processors, memory, storage, network interfaces and devices for virtual machines (VMs), allowing the same set of resources to be shared among various VMs so that they can run together on the same hardware without knowing about each other's presence. Despite its indisputable benefits, data security vulnerabilities and performance degradation from the user's viewpoint, remain the main cause of concern, motivating fervent research involving hardware and software improvements for alleviating the two concerns. However, implementation and proper testing of these innovations is not easy with hardware, hybrid or API based software simulators, due to high implementation costs, absence of simulators capable of testing solutions that span multiple levels of hardware and software, and the different privilege levels of instructions. This is more relevant when the improvements proposed include instruction set modifications at different privilege levels. In this paper, we propose a different simulation approach - multikernel simulation approach. This is different from the conventional software-based simulation techniques in that we utilize the different privilege levels of the various kernels running on the server, and leverage them to distribute the components and logic that need to be simulated, into different levels of software, to simulate the effect of using it on the required privilege level. To accomplish this, we identify unused bits in the kernel software and use them to simulate hardware conditions. We implement and demonstrate this simulation technique for the Extended-HyperWall and RSDM architecture [1], [2], which is a hardware-based solution to improve the security of virtual machines in a fully virtualized environment, in the presence of an untrusted hypervisor (an entity that manages VMs), against rollback based attacks. Our simulation works in a fully virtualized environment and demonstrates the security of the proposed enhancement, without hardware prototypes, in a cost effective manner. © 2017 IEEE.","CIP table; Extended HyperWall architecture; HyperWall architecture; Multikernel simulation; Rollback attacks; Simulation Technique; Virtualization","Application programming interfaces (API); Cloud computing; Computation theory; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Hardware; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Network security; Software testing; Virtual machine; Virtualization; CIP table; Foundational elements; Multi-kernel; Performance degradation; Rollback attacks; Security vulnerabilities; Simulation technique; Virtualized environment; Virtual reality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538625651,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Generally, in traditional way data stored on cloud and user can fetch data from cloud but if data can be stored in encrypted format security of data will get increased. We are using encryption algorithm for this purpose. Our aim is to secure the data as well as we don't want to store the same data again and again, if not required by client, onto cloud. Duplication is avoided in our system but if clients want to store the duplicate data then also access permission to clients are given. Decryption and Deduplication access permission is given. Self data destruction algorithm is also proposed in the system. After specific interval of time old data will automatically get deleted from cloud. Time stamp will be provided to each data item while storing it onto cloud. By doing this we are storing data on cloud in encrypted format, increasing security, and by deduplication and self data destruction no duplicate data will get store onto cloud which results decrease in rent that user has to pay and using self destruction algorithm data will get deleted after specific time interval which user has specified at the time of data storage. © 2017 IEEE.","Access control; Access policy (AP); Attribute based encryption(ABE); Cloud service provider(CSP); Proxy reencryption; Secure hash algorithm (SHA)","Access control; Distributed database systems; Hash functions; Access policies; Attribute based encryption (ABE); Cloud service providers; Proxy re encryptions; Secure hash algorithm; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062669,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The wireless sensor communication network is one of the major components of the critical infrastructure in all networked systems including networked control systems and CPSs. As these systems support range of time and data sensitive applications, varying from health care to emergency services, to transport, and to environmental monitoring services, core sensor network component faces potential threats due to varying attacks, including wormhole attack that can cause damage to the control system in terms of data leakage, data dropping, and delayed delivery. It is also difficult to detect, as it requires neither nodes in the network to be compromised nor adversaries to acquire valid network identity to instigate such attacks. Many existing solutions in the literature to detect wormholes are based on node's static location information, synchronization of clocks, use of additional hardware, such as antennas and GPS, and neighborhood and traffic information, which may lead to large energy consumption. In this paper, a scalable and distributed scheme which uses sequential probability ratio test is proposed, to avoid single point failures and to handle high mobility, with no additional resource requirements. It is observed that wormholes are detected using few packets and detection is faster with increasing mobility. The system is highly customizable as system parameters can be chosen to balance the speed and accuracy of detection.

It aims to find sets of items i.e. itemsets from a database with utility no less than a user defined threshold. The notion of utility provides more flexibility to an analyst to mine relevant itemsets. Nowadays, a continuous and unbounded stream of data is generated from web-clicks, transaction flow from retail stores, sensor networks, etc. Mining high-utility itemsets from a data stream is a challenging task as the incoming stream of data has to be processed on the fly with time and storage memory constraints. The number of high-utility itemsets depends on the user-defined threshold. A large number of itemsets can be generated at very low threshold values and vice versa. It can be a tedious task to set a threshold value to get a reasonable number of itemsets. Top-k high-utility itemset mining was coined to address this issue. k is the number of high-utility itemsets in the result set as defined by the user. In this paper, we propose a data structure and an efficient algorithm for mining top-k high-utility itemsets from a data stream. The algorithm has a single phase that does not generate any candidates, unlike many algorithms that work in two phases, i.e., candidate generation followed by candidates verification. We conduct extensive experiments on several real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs 20 to 80 times better on sparse datasets and 300 to 700 times on dense datasets than the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm requires less memory compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data mining; Data streams; Pattern mining; Top-k high utility mining; Utility mining","Data communication systems; Data mining; Retail stores; Sensor networks; Candidate generation; Data stream; High utility itemset minings; High utility itemsets; Pattern mining; Sliding window models; State-of-the-art algorithms; Utility mining; Digital storage","Goyal, V.; Department of Computer Science, Indraprastha Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: vikram@iiitd.ac.in",,"Springer New York LLC",0924669X,,APITE,,"English","Appl Intell",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020386407

In cloud, owing to the size of the stored data and lack of locality information among the stored files, metadata is a suitable method of keeping track of the storage. This paper describes a novel framework for efficient retrieval of data from the cloud data servers using metadata with less amount of time. Performance of queries due to availability of files for query processing can be greatly improved by the efficient use of metadata and its analysis thereof. Hence this paper proposes a generic approach of using metadata in cloud, named ‘MaaS—Metadata as a Service’. The proposed approach has exploited various methodologies in reducing the latency during data retrieval. This paper investigates the issues on creation of metadata, metadata management and analysis of metadata in a cloud environment for fast retrieval of data. Cloud bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure used for efficient retrieval of metadata is stored across various metadata servers dispersed geographically. We have implemented the model in a cloud environment and the experimental results show that methodology used is efficient on increasing the throughput and also by handling large number of queries efficiently with reduced latency. The efficacy of the approach is tested through experimental studies using KDD Cup 2003 dataset. In the experimental results, proposed ‘MaaS’ has outperformed other existing methods. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bloom filter; Cloud data storage; Clustering; Frequent pattern; Metadata","Data structures; Digital storage; Metadata; Bloom filters; Cloud data; Cloud environments; Clustering; Frequent pattern; Metadata management; Probabilistic data; Reduced latencies; Data reduction","Anitha, R.; Department of Information Science and Engineering, CEG Campus, Anna UniversityIndia; email: anitabalajim@yahoo.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09565515,,JIMNE,,"English","J Intell Manuf",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928128857

Maximum power point trackers are so important in photovoltaic systems to increase their efficiency. The system consists of a photovoltaic solar module connected to a DC–DC buck–boost converter and load. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller is used to track the maximum power. DC–DC boost converter and space vector modulation-based inverter are used to provide the required supply to the load. The proposed ANFIS-based MPPT improves the system efficiency even at abnormal weather conditions. Here a lot of reduction in torque and current ripple contents is obtained with the help of ANFIS-based MPPT for an asynchronous motor drive. Also, the better performance of an asynchronous motor drive is analyzed with the comparison of conventional and proposed MPPT controller using MATLAB simulation along with experimental implementation. The experimental implementation of MPPT with hardware setup is done using dSPACE real-time controller. Data acquisition and codes of the successfully simulated model can be linked and loaded directly to the dSPACE DS-1104 controller for real-time hardware operation. The simulation and the practical results represent that the proposed system tracked the maximum power accurately and successfully under different working conditions.

Specifically, it functions by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), or hypervisor. The reconstructed semantic details obtained by the VMI are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor. In order to distinguish between these two states, the existing out-of-VM security solutions require extensive manual analysis. In this paper, we propose an advanced VMM-based, guest-assisted Automated Internal-and-External (A-IntExt) introspection system by leveraging VMI, Memory Forensics Analysis (MFA), and machine learning techniques at the hypervisor. Further, we use the VMI-based technique to introspect digital artifacts of the live guest OS to obtain a semantic view of the processes details. We implemented an Intelligent Cross View Analyzer (ICVA) and implanted it into our proposed A-IntExt system, which examines the data supplied by the VMI to detect hidden, dead, and dubious processes, while also predicting early symptoms of malware execution on the introspected guest OS in a timely manner. Machine learning techniques are used to analyze the executables that are mined and extracted using MFA-based techniques and ascertain the malicious executables. The practicality of the A-IntExt system is evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables onto the live guest OSs. The evaluation results achieved 99.55% accuracy and 0.004 False Positive Rate (FPR) on the 10-fold cross-validation to detect unknown malware on the generated dataset. Additionally, the proposed system was validated against other benchmarked malware datasets and the A-IntExt system outperforms the detection of real-world malware at the VMM with performance exceeding 6.3%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Feature selection methods; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Memory forensics analysis; Semantic gap; Virtual machine introspection; Virtual machine monitor","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer viruses; Digital storage; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Semantics; Virtual machine; Feature selection methods; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Memory forensics; Semantic gap; Virtual machine introspection; Virtual machine monitors; Malware","Ajay Kumara, M.A.; Department of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaIndia; email: ajayit13f01@nitk.edu.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",17422876,,,,"English","Digit.

The insights drawn from Data analysis are used to transform healthcare, Engineering of products, Cyber Security, National intelligence and business. Data is becoming extremely large that, it is becoming difficult to process using traditional data storage systems, because of their centralized data processing behavior. Big Data tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark use MapReduce as programming paradigm which has decentralized data processing behavior. Spark performs in-memory cluster computing which makes it 100x times faster than Hadoop. This paper proposes to identify various inefficiencies in the current design of shuffle phase in Spark. Shuffle phase is all-Toall communication mechanism and can potentially introduce network, disk, memory and CPU scheduling overheads. A simple strategy to optimize shuffle performance is by using NIO buffers and large buffer read and writes during shuffling which would result in better performance by reducing the number of disk read and writes when partition size in spill is small. Data from input channel is buffered into large buffer by performing a single read using NIO buffer. Then, data from buffer is put into the output channel for shuffling. This reduces the number of disk operations as well as multiple copies of data between JVM and native memory. This method also reduces the CPU scheduling overheads by providing non-blocking modes for threads provided by NIO buffer. © 2017 IEEE.","DAG; NIO buffer; RDD; UnsafeShuffle Sorter","Cluster computing; Data handling; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Scheduling; Communication mechanisms; Cyber security; Data storage systems; NIO buffer; Output channels; Phase optimization; Programming paradigms; UnsafeShuffle Sorter; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

There are various requirements that need to be addressed by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for enabling the cloud services to the users such as security, performance, availability, integrability, customization with minimal cost. If any of these requirements are not met, then the user wishes to switch from current CSP to a new CSP. To achieve that the user has to download all the digital assets, services, IT resources and applications from one CSP and upload into another CSP. This process has many issues like security, vendor management, technical integration, requirement of time and energy resources, etc; The first one being a major concern which we are addressing it in this paper. Here we propose a secure data migration technique to migrate the data from one cloud storage system to another cloud storage system. The proposed approach comprises of mutual authentication, blended with key splitting and sharing methods that ensure pre-migration authentication. The migration of data is then performed by encrypting with symmetric keys, which are shared using RSA Cryptosystem. The security factors such as confidentiality, authorization, authenticity, integrity are ensured by this technique.

This perhaps is due to the use of inappropriate descriptors during the feature extraction stage. In this paper, a Radon Transform is used as an iris signature descriptor. Blood vessels are segmented from iris image. After blood vessel segmentation, the radon transform is applied on the segmented image. The GLCM, Gabor and Local Binary Patterns are used for feature extraction. Well known SVM classifier is used for classification of the iris data. The performance of the system is evaluated on DRIVE and High Resolution Image Databases. The system performs better for the radon transform signature.

Images are prone to tampering, leakage and attacks. Hence, it is very essential to secure images in the fields of medical science, defense and law enforcement. Cryptographic techniques provide secure transmission of confidential images. Among the security requirements, authentication and confidentiality are the most essential ones. S-DES fulfills the confidentiality requirement and Reversible Watermarking provides the authentication that can retrieve the original image and the watermark. In this paper, the image to be secured is watermarked using a watermark image and then encrypted with S-DES (Simple-Data Encryption Standard) algorithm. This encrypted image is decrypted by applying S-DES decryption first and then removing the watermark. In addition to this, the image security approach confirms the secrecy of the image. © 2017 IEEE.","Data Encryption Standard; Image security; Peak-to-Signal Noise Ratio; Reversible Watermarking; Steganography","Authentication; Cryptography; Developing countries; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Medical imaging; Steganography; Watermarking; Cryptographic techniques; Data encryption standard; Image security; Reversible watermarking; Secure transmission; Security requirements; Signal-noise ratio; Watermark images; Image watermarking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Security is of pre-eminent interest in this new era of computing as many e-commerce and social networking sites move their operations to the Cloud. One of the approaches to protect the Cloud Environment is to create a highly efficient system for Intrusion Detection which can handle both outsider as well as insider attacks. This paper proposes a misuse detection system at hypervisor layer to detect the inter-VM attacks in a virtual environment. It is named as Introspection-based Hybrid approach for Intrusion Detection System for Cloud (IHIDS). Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) provides the needed system call sequences at the hypervisor layer. The proposed Hybrid model integrates information and evidence from system-wide process monitoring and the virtual network traffic analysis. The main focus of the paper is to detect intrusion at hypervisor layer by simultaneously analyzing network traffic and system calls. Anomalous behavior among tenant VMs caused because of Flooding and Port Scanning attacks is detected. The proposed technique is light-weight as there is no need to hold a large amount of data at any instance of time. It is efficient as well, in terms of complexity and resources it utilizes. It is validated against the dataset created in our lab and results are encouraging. © 2017 IEEE.","Intrusion detection; Process monitoring; Virtual machine introspection","Application programs; Cloud computing; Computer crime; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Mercury (metal); Network security; Process control; Process monitoring; Social sciences computing; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Websites; Anomalous behavior; Hybrid intrusion detection; Intrusion Detection Systems; Misuse detection systems; On-demand services; Social networking sites; System-call sequence; Virtual machine introspection; Intrusion detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063673,,,"English","Int.

Hadoop default scheduler assumes a homogeneous environment. This assumption of homogeneity does not work at all times in practice and limits the performance of MapReduce. In heterogeneous environments, the job completion times do not synchronize. Data locality is essentially moving computation closer (faster access) to the input data. Fundamentally, MapReduce does not always look into the heterogeneity from a data locality perspective. Improving data locality for MapReduce framework is an important issue to enhance the performance of heterogeneous Hadoop clusters. Learning based scheduling decisions can potentially help in significantly reducing the overall job execution time. In this paper, we provide an overview of the taxonomy for MapReduce schedulers. This paper proposes a novel hybrid scheduler using a Reinforcement learning based approach.

In data processing and data mining, duplicates can effect severely. Data deduplication is a technique that eliminates duplicate data and store only one copy, promoting single instance storage. The main challenges are to identify maximum duplicate segment and selecting the storage nodes for distributing fragments of files. In this paper we proposed, Duplicate Detection and Fragment Placement (DDFP) a deduplication system that effectively eliminates duplicate data and fragments placement that allocates unique instances of a data file on storage nodes. For repeated data, reference pointer is used and only unique data is stored on the storage node. This increases the percentage of duplicate data detection. A fragment placement algorithm is used for placing fragments on different storage nodes. To select nodes T-coloring is used, Set T is used, which restricts the nodes that are at distance T from one another. DDFP considerably achieves duplicate elimination and obtain the high level of security on data fragments by storing fragments of the data file using T-coloring. This Selects the nodes that are not adjacent which prevent unauthorized access to data from other users. © 2017 IEEE.","Chunk fragmentation; Data duplication; Distributed; Locality; Storage system","Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Intelligent systems; Chunk fragmentation; Data duplication; Distributed; Locality; Storage systems; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042647,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The need for data security in the cloud is progressively higher as the abundant sensitive data in the cloud are transferred among various stakeholders for data operations leads to loss of data confidentiality. To maintain data confidentiality in the cloud, the data need to be encrypted with cryptographic algorithms. Existing cryptographic algorithms face the challenges of key management, dynamic encryption, and computational complexity. In this paper, a novel variant of DNA cryptosystem is proposed to secure the original data within the DNA nucleotides providing greater storage space, reduced overhead and dynamic operations. The significance of DNA is incorporated in the proposed Novel DNA cryptosystem, which encrypts the data transferred between the Data Owner and the Data User in the cloud. Enhanced ElGamal cryptosystem is the proposed asymmetric cryptosystem used to address key management issues in the cloud, by securely transferring the key file between the Data Owner and the Data User. Enhanced ElGamal cryptosystem provides better user authentication and performance with respect to the security accomplishment against attacks. At the same time, Novel DNA cryptosystem achieves better performance, reduced the complexity of implementing the properties of DNA and embarks upon a standardized algorithmic approach among the existing DNA cryptographic methodologies. The performance analysis, mathematical proof as well as security analysis forms the security metrics and it meets out the proposed objectives.

Hardware prefetching techniques have been proposed to exploit various kinds of access patterns. However, there are applications that are highly irregular in nature that evolved in the past decade, and have massive memory footprint. Temporal prefetching techniques are effective in predicting the future addresses of these irregular applications. Prior works on temporal prefetching use large data structures to store temporal patterns and future memory accesses are predicted using these patterns. However, these techniques predict future accesses only when there is a pattern that is already trained for a given cache line address. To address this issue, we propose Region Correlated Temporal Prefetcher (RCTP). Our technique correlates temporal patterns of memory regions and predicts future accesses for the region whose patterns are yet to be populated. Thus, RCTP helps in predicting cache line addresses whose first access is yet to happen unlike the traditional temporal prefetchers. We evaluate RCTP on SPEC CPU 2006, CRONO, and PBBS benchmark suites. RCTP outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal prefetcher named ISB by 26%, and a recent delta prefetcher called VLDP by 6%. This improvement comes with a hardware overhead of 1KB over ISB; however, RCTP does not require off-chip storage, unlike other temporal prefetchers. © 2017 IEEE.","Cache; Hardware Prefetching; Temporal Correlation","Cache memory; Digital storage; Forecasting; Hardware; Cache; Hardware overheads; Irregular applications; Modern processors; Prefetching; Prefetching techniques; Temporal correlations; Temporal pattern; Computer hardware","Varkey, D.A.; Dept. of Computer Science and Engg., Indian Institute of Technology MadrasIndia; email: dennis@cse.iitm.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538622544,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The rise in cloud computing is due to the provided facilities such as flexibility, disaster recovery, security, etc. Moving data into cloud servers provide great convenience to users because they just have to upload their data and not care about the hardware management and security. But, the sensitive or privacy relevant data has some major implications. The techniques used so far for storage security are the cryptographic methods and some compression techniques such as compression sensing, JPEG compression technique, etc. to make more space for future data. In this paper we propose a system so that the cloud storage can be made more secure. To increase the efficiency, we are using DCT algorithm for compression and AES for encryption. The main concept of the proposed system is to increase the security so we are splitting the image in chunks. This Image splitting method, lowers the risk of image being retrieved by attacker as we upload the chunks instead of image. © 2017 IEEE.","cloud storage; Image splitting; privacy; security","Access control; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Image compression; Network security; Cloud storages; Compression sensing; Compression techniques; Cryptographic methods; Data access control; Government services; Image splitting; security; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467388542,,,"English","Int.

The seek time is the time taken to move the arm to the proper cylinder and the rotational delay is the time for the proper sector to rotate under the head. The seek time dominates the other two factors by a wide margin. Thus, disk scheduling algorithms are used to reduce the seek time and improve the performance of the system substantially. There exist several disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First Come First Serve), SSTF (Shortest seek time first), SCAN (for both directions), C-SCAN (Circular SCAN), LOOK (for both directions) and C-LOOK (Circular LOOk). All these algorithms use a single head. The proposed algorithm uses two heads instead of one thereby improving the performance of modern storage devices in terms of throughput. The throughput can be increased by reducing total head movements. The working of the proposed algorithm has 4 cases based on the nature of requested tracks. When both the heads are working together, they serve the requests of their areas and do not overlap. In some cases, only a single head is used to serve all the requests, thus improving the battery usage. © 2017 IEEE.","Computational modeling; Disk drives; FCFS; hard disks; LOOK; Operating systems; SCAN; sector; seek time; SSTF; track","Computer operating systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Hard disk storage; Rotating disks; Virtual storage; Computational model; Disk drive; FCFS; LOOK; SCAN; sector; Seek time; SSTF; track; Scheduling algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

As the application areas of the WSN are increasing at the same rate the security threats are also increasing. Intruders are applying various mechanisms to access the sensible and confidential data from sensors. Hence, strong security measures are much needed to immune WSNs from various attacks. Authentication is a security mechanism that protects WSNs from wide range of security attacks. In this paper, an authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is based on tokens. Any node when deployed in WSN is embedded with base station's public key and through the corresponding cluster head; it requests and acquires its token for authentication from the base station. The generated token is light in weight and reduces much of computational, communicational and storage overheads. The proposed protocol is verified for its security both formally and automatically. The proposed protocol is proved to be secure by evaluation in BAN logic and found SAFE by AVISPA-a model checker tool for testing authentication protocol. © 2017 IEEE.","Dynamic; Light weight; Node authentication; Token; Wireless Sensor Networks","Authentication; Base stations; Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital storage; Dynamics; Internet protocols; Model checking; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication protocols; Confidential data; Light weight; Mutual authentication; Node authentications; Security mechanism; Strong securities; Token; Network security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032389,,,"English","Proc.

The HSH clustering is an enhancement of hierarchical algorithm that considers the homogeneity and relative population of the clusters to measure the Clustering Performance Index (CPI). The MSPM framework is a modification of Apriori algorithm implemented using MapReduce function. This framework enhances the performance of clustering by the parallel processing of Map and Reduce functions.

This provides the computing world as an utility based scenario of sharing the given resources of different data centeres with enormous opportunities. Though replicas of a data file has increased, the performance and availability of data also increases. In this paper the different aspects on dynamic, cost-aware with the data replication method through optimization is proposed which identifies the less amount of information of data replication which is required to make sure that the data availability increases with the increase in the replication process. The multi objective optimization strategy for the cost of replication from higher-cost data centers to lower-cost data centers being implemented by the concept of Improved knapsack algorithm and considering the availability and load balancing in the replication process. Data can be managed effectively by file replication, which reduces effectively the file service time and access latency, which increases the file availability and the system get improved through load balancing. An efficient and improved multi-objective optimized replication management (EIMORM) can solve these optimal solutions by balancing among these optimization objectives. Some experiments clearly shows that the EIMORM is much more energy efficiency and the performance in the replication system of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) with the multi-objective evolutionary stated algorithm with the performance, load balancing in cloud storage clustors.

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

However, the availability of transit maps for many developing countries is very limited, primarily due to the various socio-economic factors that drive the private operated and partially regulated transport services. Public transports at these cities are marred with many factors such as uncoordinated waiting time at bus stoppages, crowding in the bus, sporadic road conditions etc., which also need to be annotated so that commuters can take informed decision. Interestingly, many of these factors are spatio-temporal in nature. In this paper, we develop CityMap, a system to automatically extract transit routes along with their eccentricities from spatio-temporal crowdsensed data collected via commuters’ smart-phones.

One of the core challenges of WSN is to increase the network life time, meaning that the efficiency of power utilisation should be the maximum. The major reasons for high power consumption are drawn out transmission path to reach sink, work load add-ons on nodes closer to storage medium, and the energy necessary for storage. This study proposes a novel method of data storage and retrieval for WSN environment to improve the network lifetime by minimising the energy consumption. The proposed method accomplishes this milestone using four novel algorithms, namely weighted optimum storage-node placement(SNP), efficient and energetic wireless recharging, efficient rule-based node rotation and critical-state-data passing. The areas of influence of this proposed method are SNP, wireless recharging, node rotation and cooperative multi-input-multi-output clustering/routing.

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","blindness; Cloud computing; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy; wireless body area networks (WBANs)","Cloud computing; Data privacy; Digital storage; Health care; Hospitals; Internet of things; Network function virtualization; Search engines; Servers; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; blindness; Body Area Network; Delays; Internet of Things (IOT); Wireless body area network; Wireless communications; Distributed computer systems","Chatterjee, S.; IIT KharagpurIndia; email: chatterjeesubarna@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10897798,,ICLEF,,"English","IEEE Commun Lett",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028459167

A large number of data's are stored in Big Data storage every second. For instance in YouTube for every second a video of size 72 hours are being uploaded. It shows that big data have a big scope in handling of large data. Big data for learning, intelligence, data fusion, social network, mining and so many plays a vital role in it. The big data technologies along with machine learning algorithm have developed lots of advanced development in the field of social mining, network and social Medias.

In Social mining along with text the symbols are also analysed for effective mining of users. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems. The data storage size can be optimized by using the map reduce algorithm in a effective way for data storage in big data. When the repeateddata's are replaced with its reference then the storage will be optimized.

Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access control, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics cannot be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission method between the medias, where the users require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, we use smart cards as an effective yet efficient solution to this critical data storage problem. Furthermore, iris texture has been used as a human identifier for some time now. This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a person from another as its unique yet perfectly stable over time. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of iris texture verification on smart cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner's card, guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved using circular translations of the matched iris codes. However, after a thorough analysis of the achieved results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biometrics; Iris texture; Privacy; Security; Smart card","Biometrics; Data privacy; Digital storage; Hardware security; Smart cards; Transportation; Efficient implementation; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; High securities; Iris texture; Security; Security and privacy; Smart projects; Access control","Nedjah, N.; Department of Electronics Engineering and Telecommunication, Engineering Faculty, State University of Rio de JaneiroBrazil; email: nadia@eng.uerj.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020050235

End users expect high data rates coupled with secure data access for various applications executed either at the edge (fog computing) or in the core network (cloud computing). However, the bidirectional data flow between the end users and the devices located at either the edge or core may cause congestion at the cloud data centers, which are used mainly for data storage and data analytics. The high mobility of devices (e.g., vehicles) may also pose additional challenges with respect to data availability and processing at the core data centers. Hence, there is a need to have most of the resources available at the edge of the network to ensure the smooth execution of end-user applications. Considering the challenges of future user demands, we present an architecture that integrates cloud and fog computing in the 5G environment that works in collaboration with the advanced technologies such as SDN and NFV with the NSC model. The NSC service model helps to automate the virtual resources by chaining in a series for fast computing in both computing technologies.

It allows patients to easily share their health information from any location with doctors. An android smartphone fetches vital signs of the patient from the sensors configured with the smartphone. The various vital signs are grouped together on a time to time basis as a record (i.e., PHR) and is then uploaded to a cloud storage through the smartphone. The PHRs may contain abnormal vital signs. An algorithm running on the private cloud constantly monitors the vital signs streamed from the smartphone to detect any abnormality in the patient's health condition. Existing algorithms omits the patient's health history while detecting abnormality. To overcome this existing issue, a cloud based health monitoring system has been developed using a Modified Weighted Average Method (MWAM) along with Naïve Bayesian classifier is proposed. The proposed Cloud based Remote Monitoring System(CRMS) classifies whether the patient's health condition is normal or abnormal by giving equal preference to patient's health history and current vital signs and also predicts the degree of abnormality on a scale of 1 to 3 (low, medium and high). An android application has been developed for the patients that receives live data from the WBAN sensors and uploads to the cloud. Abnormality detection algorithm is deployed on the cloud setup that continuously monitors the patient's vital parameters and alerts the doctor and patient's caretakers when the patient's health is abnormal. From the experimental results, it is found that the MWAM boosts the performance of the Naïve Bayesian algorithm in alert generation. © 2017 IEEE.","Abnormality detection; Cloud Based Remote Monitoring System; Decision parameter; Naïve Bayesian classifier; Personal Health Record; Weighted Average Method; Wireless Body Area Network","Android (operating system); Digital storage; Health; mHealth; Monitoring; Remote control; Smartphones; Sodium; Statistical methods; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Abnormality detection; Bayesian classifier; Decision parameters; Personal health record; Remote monitoring system; Weighted average method; Wireless body area network; Remote patient monitoring",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059058,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Second, the same converter is used for charging the main battery when the internal combustion engine is running. Third, the same converter will act as an inverter in electric/hybrid electric mode supplying power to wheels through motor from the battery. Forth, the regeneration mode, the machine's phase windings energize the dc-link voltage i.e. battery through same converter act as a rectifier. The electrical energy flow within the drivetrain is controlled by a power electronic converter with less power switching devices and magnetic devices. During charging mode, the power converter and the machine phase windings are controlled with a three-phase magnetic contactor to enable the use of the ac-dc rectifier for charging the battery.

It is used to access the stored data in bit cell during read cycle. Sense intensifier enhances the little distinction between bit lines to the full swing level. Its execution influences the get to time and power dissemination of memory and henceforth by lessening the detecting deferral and power utilization of sense speaker the execution of memory makes strides. Since the majority of the memory related operations are perused operations, this causes a vast sparing in the general power scattered by the memory. Additionally as sense intensifiers scatters extensive amount of short out power instead of the dynamic power disseminated by the cell exhibit, substantial power is spared. The requirement for the hearty outline of low power fast CMOS simple VLSI circuits is developing immensely. This development is because of the innovative drive that originates from the decrease of the base component size to downsize the chip zone. Downsizing the transistor size can then coordinate more circuit segments are solitary chip zone and bring down the cost. Likewise littler geometry normally brings down the parasitic capacitances, which implies higher working pace and lower control utilization. For a comparative analysis, we will be cataloguing the different sense amplifiers in use currently, using various nanometer technologies such as 180nm, 90nm and 45nm.

Cloud computing is involved in our day to day life as it offers several services, storage spaces, applications etc. As the usage increases, vulnerability and security threats arose need to be studied and rectified. As a part of this, proper authentication need to be done before allowing file uploading to cloud. Compared with traditional identification methods, authentication system using biometric are more reliable and universal. Since biometric cannot be lost or forgotten it provides more reliability and security. So biometric provide more security because it requires physical person to be authenticated. Stealing the biometric values by hacker attack will be protected by biometric cryptosystem. This enable users to upload a file safely from their computer and have it saved on the web server's file system. This would provide the basis for easy ways of storing and retrieving data directly within the database which involves a bit more code than working with data through the file system. Additionally, in order for a user to view or download data they must be presented with a URL to that data. If the data resides on the web server's file system, the URL would be a straightforward process. And if the data is stored in the database, a web page needs to be created and retrieve and return the data from the database. Further, if the data is stored on the file system, the demand and network congestion between the database server and web server will be less than when the data is stored directly within the database. Multi-biometric cryptosystem offer high authentication accuracy, wider population coverage and strong security compared to single biometric cryptosystem. © 2017 IEEE.","Biometrics; Fingerprint feature extraction; Iris feature extraction; Mutli Biometric Cryptosystem","Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptography; Database systems; Extraction; Feature extraction; File organization; Personal computing; Web services; Websites; Authentication systems; Biometric cryptosystem; Decision level fusion; Fingerprint features; Identification method; Iris feature extraction; Network congestions; Strong securities; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509067015,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed - such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part.

In recent years, various digital image processing techniques are developed. Computer Vision, machine interfaces, manufacturing industry, data compression for storage, vehicle tracking and many more are some of the domains of digital image processing application. In most of the cases, digital biomedical images contains various types of noise, artifacts etc. and are not useful for direct applications. Before using it in any process, the input image has to be gone through some preprocessing stages; such preprocessing is generally called as image enhancement. In this work, a new technique has been proposed to enhance biomedical images using modified cuckoo search algorithm and morphological operation. Presence of noise and other unwanted objects generates distortion in an image and it will affect the ultimate result of the process. In case of biomedical images, accuracy of the results is very important. It may also decrease the discernibility of many features inside the images. It can affect the classification accuracy. In this work, this issue has been targeted and improved by obtaining better contrast value after converting the color image into grayscale image. The basic property of the cuckoo search algorithm is that the amplitudes of its components are capable to objectively describe the contribution of the gray levels to the formation of image information for the best contrast value of a digital image. The proposed method modified the conventional cuckoo search method by employing the McCulloch's method for levy flight generation. After computing the best contrast value, morphological operation has been applied. In morphological operation based phase, the intensity parameters are tuned for quality enhancement. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of this work. © 2017 IEEE.","biomedical imaging; image enhancement; Modified cuckoo search; morphological operations","Bioinformatics; Digital image storage; Digital storage; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Manufacturing data processing; Mathematical morphology; Medical imaging; Optimization; Biomedical imaging; Classification accuracy; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Digital image processing technique; Intensity parameters; Manufacturing industries; Morphological operations; Image enhancement",,"Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538622155,,,"English","Ind.

The amount of digital information is growing drastically due to increase in the use of internet and IoT [Internet of Things] devices. Since multiple users are dealing with same data, miscellaneous copies of same data may be generated and stored as multiple copies, which results huge amount of storage space requirements. By performing deduplication, exactly one physical copy of the data is stored and all duplicate copies of the data are referenced. So this technique eliminates storing multiple copies of the same data and save lot of storage space.

ECG data is compressed so that it can be effectively used in telemedicine. For telemedicine huge quantity of data signals are to be stored and sent to different places. So it is very essential to compress the ECG signal data in a resourceful way. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are mainly compressed for two reasons, on-line data transmission and effective and economical data storage. In the last five decades several data compression techniques has been developed for the compression of ECG signals. These techniques can be classified into three categories: Direct data compression (DDC), transformation compression (TC), parameter extraction compression (PEC). In this paper a comparative study of turning point (TP) compression technique and fan compression technique is done. The comparison has been on parameters like compression ratio (CR), percentage root mean square difference (PRD) and quality score (QS).

Data de-duplication technique has been used widely which allows only to store a single copy of a file and thus avoids duplication of file in the cloud storage servers. It helps to reduce the amount of storage space and save bandwidth of cloud service and thus in high cost savings for the cloud service subscribers. Today data that we need to store are in encrypted format to ensure the security. So data encryption by data owners with their own keys makes the de-duplication impossible for the cloud service subscriber as the data encryption with a key converts data into an unidentifiable format called cipher text thus encrypting, even the same data, with different keys may result in different cipher texts. But de-duplication and encryption need to work in hand to hand to ensure secure, authorized and optimized storage. In this paper, we propose a scheme for file-level de-duplication on encrypted files like text, images and even on video files stored in cloud based on the user's privilege set and file privilege set. This paper proposed a de-duplication system which distributes the files across different servers. The system uses an Erasure Correcting Code technique to re-construct the files even if the parts of the files are lost by attacking any server. Thus the proposed system can ensure both the security and reliability of encrypted files. © 2017 IEEE.","AES encryption; cloud computing; de-duplication; encryption; erasure correcting code; Reed Solomon Code; RSA encryption","Cloud computing; Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Reed-Solomon codes; AES encryption; Data de duplications; De duplications; Erasure correcting codes; Erasure correction; File-sharing system; RSA encryption; Security and reliabilities; Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509065905,,,"English","Int.

For the network transferred image, the integrity and confidentiality is a major issue, as the tampering of the medical images, results in serious issues in diagnosis and also treatment. This paper focuses on enhancing the integrity of the network transferred biomedical data along with its lossless compression. The segmentation of the Region of Interest (ROI) of the host biomedical image and the computation of the hash digest of the ROI by the Message Digest5 (MD5) algorithm would perform the partial encryption. It is followed by the Steganography of the biomedical image with the concatenated hash digest, ROI coordinates & patient data. Finally, a Wavelet based lossless compression is performed, for the sake of bandwidth & storage space, during transmission.

The input file is split into two, in order to make the access of the whole data difficult, and the split data is encrypted using RSA and Diffie-Hellman before storing them into two different cloud accounts.

The existing methods in privacy preservation approach, tries to anonymize the whole trajectories together. But this will certainly result in serious information loss and published data quality. It is realized that major halting points in the trajectories are more important than the pass-by points. So here this proposal put forward a method that will extract the vital halting points from the trajectory and anonymize these points during the trajectory publication by hiding these points in a zone.

The proposed scheme is applied for secure medical information transmission or its cloud storage. The scheme is implemented in two steps. In first step, randomization of patient information is done based on a password secret key before embedding it into the cover medical image. Second step is to hide the watermarked image into a secret key image before cloud storage so that even if the stored image is hacked or leaked, the cover medical image along with embedded patient information cannot be retrieved by the hacker. In this paper we have proposed a novel watermarking algorithm for medical images by randomizing the information according to the secret password key and then embedding it into the cover medical image followed by embedding of cover image into another secret key image. The proposed scheme aims to protect sensitive information transfer and cloud storage from unauthorized access. Extraction of the embedded information at the receiver end is done in two steps. Firstly, non-blind detection is carried out in which cover medical image is extracted with help of secret key image. In the second step, binary image watermark is extracted by analyzing the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient values.

Compression is needed because of the limitations in storage capacity and bandwidth requirements. In normal cases, the compressed data is encrypted and transmitted. But, this sequential approach is time consuming and computationally expensive. In this paper, a study on simultaneous compression and encryption scheme, based on the compression ratio and time, is done for different sized input sets. In simultaneous scheme, compression and encryption can be done at single step which reduces time for the entire operation. Compression is done using Arithmetic coding and encryption is done using XOR encryption. The XOR encryption introduces some randomness because of the presence of pseudorandom number generator. Thus the scheme is more secure against attacks.

To address this problem, we have come up with a solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places, it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs. Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security from hackers. © 2017 IEEE.","Background Subtraction Algorithm; Blowfish Algorithm; Decryption; Encryption; IoT; Security; Streaming; Surveillance","Acoustic streaming; Cameras; Cryptography; Digital storage; Image segmentation; Information management; Monitoring; Motion analysis; Motion compensation; Network security; Personal computing; Remote sensing; Space surveillance; Video cameras; Background subtraction algorithms; Decryption; Detecting sensors; Encryption and decryption; Security; Smart surveillance; Smart surveillance systems; Video surveillance; Security systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509040834,,,"English","Int.

But during migrating live virtual machines along with system files and storage data, network traffic gets increases across network bandwidth and delays in migration time. There is need to reduce the migration time in order to maintain the system performance by analyzing and optimizing the storage overheads which mainly creates due to unnecessary duplicated data transferred during live migration. So there is need of such storage device which will keep the duplicated data residing in both the source as well as target physical host i.e. NAS. The proposed hash map based algorithm maps all I/O operations in order to track the duplicated data by assigning hash value to both NAS and RAM data. Only the unique data then will be sent data to the target host without affecting service level agreement (SLA), without affecting VM migration time, application downtime, SLA violations, VM pre-migration and downtime post migration overheads during pre and post migration of virtual machines. © 2017 IEEE.","Datacenters; Live Migration; NAS; virtualization","Maintenance; Network architecture; Network security; Random access storage; Signal processing; Sodium; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Virtual storage; Virtualization; Data centers; Live migrations; Map based algorithm; Network bandwidth; Network traffic; Service Level Agreements; Storage overhead; System maintenance; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049295,,,"English","Proc.

It has become one of the essential services in cloud computing. Many advantages of multi-cloud storage attracts the individuals and organization to move their data from remote to cloud servers. Recently many Multi-cloud storage services have been proposed but most of them focus on the single specific organization and file formats. In addition most providers use attribute based encryption which encrypts only particular database fields which reduces the trust of the many individuals and organizations. The biggest challenge that the present business world faces in multi-cloud storage is that there is no single standard architecture and procedure that can meet the requirements of the individuals and organizations. In order to address this challenge, this paper presents an effective architectural framework with a standard algorithm which would enable to enhance the secure data sharing through dynamic index based cryptographic data slicing. The proposed model is suitable for decision making process for the individuals and organizations in the adoption of multi-cloud storage service based on trust. © 2017 IEEE.","Cryptographic data slicing; Data Sharing; Multi-cloud; Security","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Decision making; Societies and institutions; Trusted computing; Architectural frameworks; Attribute-based encryptions; Cryptographic techniques; Data Sharing; Data slicing; Decision making process; Multi-clouds; Security; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055739,,,"English","Proc. - World Congr.

However, each individual entity is not equipped with the right amount of resources to perform necessary computations on large data. Cloud computing provides a platform to compute, store and share data remotely for heterogeneous entities and provides services to them according to their demand. One of the major challenges in cloud computing platform is to ensure security and privacy of the data. The major limitation of applying existing cryptosystem such as AES, 3-DES, etc. is the need of decryption of ciphertext for outsourced computations that may violate data security. Homomorphic encryption is a solution which allows performing computations directly on cipher text without decrypting of the ciphertext. In this paper, we present an efficient model to implement different algorithms related to benchmark computations on ciphertext derived using the Dijk, Gentry, Halevi and Vaikuntanathan's homomorphic encryption scheme (DGHV scheme-2010).

Power system, though operates at normal condition for most of the operating time, may be subjected to abnormalities such as an unbalance or faults which arise frequently due to momentary tree contact, lightning strikes, bird/animal contact, and continuous load variation. Despite any aberrant situation, non-linearity of the system continues to draw harmonics from the supply. Therefore, the need for estimation of harmonics at any various situations that may occur in a power system is very important before triggering a suitable compensatory action to solve the power quality issues created by harmonics. This work will investigate the suitability of the Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) algorithm in separating the fundamental and harmonic components from the composite current/voltage waveform under various situations that may occur in the power system. This algorithm extracts the different intrinsic mode functions from the input signal by passing it through appropriate wavelet filter bank. For testing the effectiveness of EWT, in this work, a sample power system with thyristor converter fed DC Drive as a non-linear load is considered where source current is a composite waveform containing harmonics. Both synthetic and actual data from this system under various conditions other than normal operation is used for testing the proposed algorithm.

Cloud offers huge amount of space to store their user data. This technology has proved itself as a new venture because of its ability for releasing massive computational storage with reducing cost from anywhere to any user at any time. User outsources their data to the cloud for flexible, efficient and seamless services. Once the data is sent to the cloud, the cloud service provider (CSP) alone is responsible for the data. Apart from the benefits, it has lot of security issues on the data stored in the cloud. When a user outsources the data to the cloud, there is possibility to attack the data at rest as well as data in transit. Now the concern is how to secure the data and rely on the services in cloud. In order to protect the data from unauthorized access, data should be in either encrypted format or masked format. Data security is one of the major issues which acts as an obstacle in the adoption of cloud computing. This paper proposes an elegant and novel method to enhance the security of data by associating obfuscation technique along with steganography. The proposed confidentiality technique that combines the obfuscation and steganography techniques. The main principal of obfuscation is that transforms data into new form and it must conceal the original data while the steganography hides the existence of information. The obfuscated text can be hidden in image by using Least Significant Bit(LSB) substitution method. The experimental results prove that the proposed technique has high embedding capacity and high quality stego images. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud Storage; confidentiality; CSP; data obfuscation; Data security; Steganography","Cryptography; Network security; Security of data; Steganography; Cloud service providers; Cloud storages; confidentiality; Data obfuscation; Least significant bits; Security enhancements; Substitution method; Unauthorized access; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055739,,,"English","Proc. - World Congr.

It connects objects such as smart phones, sensors, Light Emitting Diodes (LED) displays, vehicles through the internet allowing them to interact and exchange information among themselves. In today's times IoT has found its application in practically every walk of life and supply chain management is no exception. At present, supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, where suppliers and customers stretch between various countries and continents. The biggest problem faced by manufacturers is to optimize supply chain performance and reduce operational costs over such large geographical stretches. IoT acts as a solution to this problem as it facilitates the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in order to interconnect all the various actors in a supply chain. This humongous network of interconnected devices generate massive amounts of data which is difficult to store and process. Cloud computing here plays a role of a facilitator and provides great help in addressing challenges related to storage and processing capabilities. In this paper, we present an Intelligent Supply Chain Management System (ISCMS) that benefits from the amalgamation of IoT and Cloud and provides real time monitoring, tracking and managing of goods from the perspective of a supplier, customer and shipper. We also propose an algorithm that depicts the working of our system. The proposed Intelligent Supply Chain Management System along with the algorithm are simulated using the iFogSim simulator. To this end, we illustrate the working of our proposed system along with the simulated results. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; iFogSim; Internet of Things; supply chain management system","Automobile manufacture; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Metals; Smartphones; Wireless sensor networks; iFogSim; Networked information systems; Processing capability; Real time monitoring; Real-world entities; Simulated results; Supply chain management system; Supply chain performance; Supply chain management",,"Kumar V.Singh U.G.Sudarsan S.D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509025763,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

It monitors the health condition and helps in giving appropriate medical treatments. This system aims at gathering and storing patient's details and sharing health related information. It also has high legitimate concerns about patient's privacy and information security. This system minimizes the infrastructural barriers for the developing nations. It also extends healthcare systems to the remote and isolated areas which has limited access to medical technologies, remote health services are provided through telecommunications. Quality of the service and security are added advantage to the system. They collect the real time personal information (PHI) and health problems from patients and transmit them to the healthcare provider for the authorized physicians to decide on the corresponding treatment. They send the PHI in terms of text and image to the cloud, and also the other personal queries related to their medical history. In cloud computing, collected PHI should match the physicians experience to judge the state of the patient and unfortunately, delegating both storage and computation to the untrusted entity would bring a series of security. This is where deduplication comes into play. It is a technique for eliminating duplicate copies of data, and has been widely used in cloud storage to reduce storage space and upload bandwidth. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been a preferred encryption technology to solve the challenging problem of security during data sharing in cloud computing.

It is widely used in image processing, video surveillance, cyber forensic, video browsing, and video indexing and retrieval applications. Though the state-of-the art computer vision algorithms provide efficient solutions for extraction of key frames, but often demands very high computational power as it involves computing very high dimensional image features. On the other hand, with the widespread use of Big Data and IOT applications, the storage, management and accessing of large volume, high velocity and variety of video data is increasing at exponential rates. Therefore, in order to address this problem we propose optimization of key frame extraction algorithms on Apache Hadoop distributed framework. As the process of extracting key-frames involves simultaneous execution of image processing tasks, the Hadoop framework divides and distributes these tasks to multiple nodes of the cluster. The MapReduce programming model has been redefined to perform the tasks of identifying key frames by color histogram difference between successive frames. The proposed optimized Hadoop's MapReduce algorithm has been tested on a data set of 1000 news videos each having approximately a length of 10 minutes. A performance speed up of 7 has been achieved by varying the size of the cluster from 1 node to 10 nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","Color Histogram; Hadoop; Key Frame Extraction; MapReduce","Big data; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Extraction; Graphic methods; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Optimization; Security systems; Color histogram; Computer vision algorithms; Hadoop; High-dimensional images; Key-frame extraction; Map-reduce; Map-reduce programming; Video indexing and retrieval; Image processing","Deshmane, P.; B.V.B CETIndia; email: deshmane.praveen@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

Cloud computing is a way or a technique to store, share and access data. It is the most efficient way, it is even cheaper than the conventional way of having physical servers or physical storage devices present at the company premises. It is faster and more efficient. The concept of cloud computing is that there is expandable storage space with no physical storage space which is accessible from anywhere in the world using any device, the data will be available for you. We can access the cloud storage through the internet. The data is stored at the storage units kept around the world managed by data management companies. These companies are responsible for the data the will back it up and it is their job to keep it secure, but even the beat of them have drawbacks. That is what will be addressed here in the paper below, security in cloud computing. Some work has been done on this field it is on that I further build on. Cloud computing is an internet dependent technology, where client data is stored and maintained in the data centers of cloud providers like Google, Amazon, Salesforce.com and Microsoft etc. Limited access to the data could cause various security issues like data leakage, insecure interface, sharing of information. This research paper explains the concept of cloud computing, the various models used in enhancing the security and how can an enhanced security blanket be put around the cloud without increasing the maintenance charges and without making it to complex.

Cloud computing provides the user with multiple resources. The resources include storage, capacity, processing and so on. There are different types of services provided by the cloud, they are Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS), Software as a Service(SaaS) and Platform as a Service(Paas). The user need not invest large amount of money for the infrastructure that is need to develop a small scale industry. Instead the developer can make use of the resources provided but the cloud and can pay only for the services which they are using. The main functionality of Cloud is to provide multiple resources to the users. Storing the data in the Cloud one of the major advantage. The hacker or the Botmaster will try to access or try to gain information of the data which is stored in the Cloud, by sending multiple request to the system. When the number of request exceeds the servers limit, the server will not be able to process the incoming request and the server may crash. The main aim of the paper is to create a framework for Cloud resilience system, which have the ability to provide the service for the clients even when the system is flooded with multiple request. When the incoming request exceeds the limit then the server will not be able to process the request and may crash. Inorder to prevent the server from crashing, a Stealthy DDos Detection Mechanism has been introduced. In this mechanism, the server monitors the number of incoming request given by each individual user. The server is initially given a limited amount of capacity to process the request of a single IP address. When the server load increases it checks all the request given by each user, if the request given by an individual user exceeds the servers limit then all the request from that particular IP address is blocked and all the services which are provided to that IP address is also denied. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud resilience system; SIPDAS; Stealthy DDoS detection; Time based detection","Cloud computing; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Personal computing; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Software as a service (SaaS); DDoS detection; Gain information; Large amounts; Multiple resources; Server loads; SIPDAS; Small scale industries; Time based; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061334,,,"English","Int.

There are various tools available for this purpose; one of such open source tool is Apache Hadoop. This tool is widely adopted for storage and management of BigData. Several methods have been suggested and implemented to analyze and enhance the Hadoop performance. This paper particularly focuses upon tuning configuration parameter approach. Although there are several configuration parameters which affect the performance of Hadoop, among that MapReduce related parameter has a significant impact. The objective of this work is to enhance the overall performance of Hadoop by reducing job execution time. Reduction in time is obtained by tuning some of MapReduce associated parameters. The right understanding of these parameters is very crucial since varying parameters with improper values can show a negative impact on overall performance.

A lot of data created every day so the data management is become a critical task. Most of time much amount of memory wastage because of same copies present on various locations. The process of eliminating the repeated or duplicates copies of data is called as Data deduplication. This data deduplication process is widely used in cloud storage to decrease storage space and upload bandwidth. However there is only one copy of each file stored even if such a file is owned by huge number of users. By using, deduplication system progress of storage utilization and reliability is increases. In addition, the dare of privacy for sensitive data also take place when they are outsourced by users to cloud. In this we use new distributed deduplication systems with upper dependability in which the data chunks are distributed from corner to cornering multiple cloud servers. The safety needs of data privacy and tag stability are also accomplish by introducing a deterministic secret sharing scheme in distributed storage systems, instead of using convergent encryption as in previous deduplication systems. A deduplication technique, on the other hand, can reduce the storage cost at the server side and save the upload bandwidth at the user side. © 2017 IEEE.","Data comparison; Deduplication; Distributed storage system; reliability; secret sharing; Secure sharing; Tag consistency","Bandwidth; Cryptography; Data privacy; Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Reliability; Data comparisons; De duplications; Distributed storage system; Secret sharing; Secure sharing; Tag consistency; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

Generally the time taken to execute a query and return the results, increases exponentially as the amount of data increases leading to more waiting times on the user. This processing inability has led to the use of Hadoop to analyze and gain insights from the data. With its distributed processing capability, Hadoop is considered as an efficient solution for query processing but it has its own limitation when the data to be processed exhibit interest locality. Generally it is observed that the data required for any query execution follows grouping behavior wherein only a part of the Big-Data set is utilized more often. Since Hadoop default data placement strategy (HDDPS) does not consider such grouping behavior among the dataset, it does not perform efficiently resulting in lacunas such as decreased local map execution, increased query execution time etc. Hence in this paper we experiment the significance of two most promising Matrix clustering techniques viz. partitioning and hierarchical in grouping aware data placement for improved performance. Both clustering techniques are separately applied over the user history log to obtain independent data groupings. These data groupings are interpreted and validated to extract the optimal data grouping for improved parallel execution. The proposed strategy was tested in 15 node Hadoop cluster. The results show an improved performance for Big-Data sets in heterogeneous distributed environment. It improves the data locality by 25.75% and reduces query execution time by 28% compared to HDDPS. Also Hierarchical based Matrix clustering shows a marginal improved performance over Partitioning based methods for queries exhibiting interest localities. © 2017 IEEE.","Big-Data; Data Placement; Hadoop; Interest Locality; Matrix Clustering","Cluster analysis; Digital storage; Matrix algebra; Query languages; Social sciences computing; Data placement; Data-intensive application; Distributed environments; Distributed processing; Hadoop; Interest Locality; Matrix clustering; Partitioning based clustering; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041459,,,"English","Natl.

The major concern with MCC is the privacy of data. Mobile users give confidential information through the network, that if not safeguarded may lead to security issues. Identity Management (IDM) is the management of user identities, their authentication, and authorization in the cloud environment. The existing Consolidated Identity Management (CIDM) overcomes the network traffic interception in the traditional IDM but is prone to Identity theft in case of Identity Management Server (IDMS) compromise. This work is focused on the development of a Secure Identity Management (SIDM) that alleviates the attacks in the CIDM by using techniques that strengthens the authentication process and identity privacy. A secure IDM is developed using two-step authentication process which involves Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and token verification. The proposed SIDM model reduces the consequences of Identity server compromise attack. There is a marginal increase in the communication overhead of SIDM compared to that of CIDM but it can be compromised to realize the benefits of identity privacy.

Answering these queries efficiently is a critical concern in the data warehouse environment. One way to address this problem is by materializing views in the data warehouse. All views cannot be materialized due to storage space constraint. Materializing an optimal subset of views is shown to be an NP-Hard problem. Alternatively views can be selected either empirically or based on some heuristic like greedy, randomized, evolutionary, swarm based etc. In this paper, a discrete genetic operator based particle swarm optimization (DGPSO) has been used to select Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice.

Object based storage is used to store the data from various users through REST API Using HTTP(S) protocol and it also stores the virtual machines images as objects in cloud environment. Cloud storage services are used by all enterprises, home users and researchers to store their files that vary in size and formats. With the huge amount of stored data which is mostly unstructured, comes the related issue of finding the exact data relevant to the requirements of a user. This paper will cover the need of object storage system in cloud computing for massive unstructured digital static data and why traditional approaches are insufficient to meet this challenge. The basic architecture of object storage systems, how the object storage system supports cloud storage environment to store unstructured data effectively. Additionally we will compare and contrast the major object based storage cloud providers in use today including Google, Microsoft and Amazon. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; Cloud Computing; Object based Storage; Unstructured data","Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Hypertext systems; Cloud environments; Cloud storage services; Object storage architecture; Object storage systems; Object-based storage; Private clouds; Traditional approaches; Unstructured data; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

However, due to increasing needs for scalability and performance, alternative systems have emerged, namely NewSQL technology. NewSQL is a class of modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) that provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) read-write workloads while still maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system. The rising interest in NewSQL technology, over the last few years resulted in an increasing number of evaluations and comparisons among competing NewSQL technologies. Some of the NewSQL databases currently used in various popular web applications are VoltDB, Google Spanner, MemSQL, SAP HANA, NuoDB, and TokuDB. This work is trying to comment on the various NewSQL database systems which describes benefits, characteristics, and classification of NewSQL databases for online transaction processing (OLTP) for Big data management. It also provides the list of popular NewSQL databases in categorized tables. This dissertation work mainly covers evaluation comparison between four NewSQL databases: NuoDB, VoltDB, MemSQL, and Cockroach DB on the basis of various parameters like read latency, write latency, update latency, and execution time. The experiments do not cover only performance (latency and execution time) but also focus on ease of use and flexibility of the used NewSQL databases. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; Cockroach DB; Distributed Databases; MemSQL; NewSQL databases; NuoDB; VoltDB","Big data; Classification (of information); Digital storage; Online systems; Relational database systems; Cockroach DB; Distributed database; MemSQL; NuoDB; VoltDB; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047154,,,"English","Proc.

We can easily transmit audio, video and images. But security and copyright protection of this digital media became a serious issue. So an emerging technique, known as digital watermarking, is used. It is widely used for protecting digital media from duplicacy and unauthorized use. In the presented paper, an approach is presented, in which we use the genetic algorithm concept in the discrete cosine transform domain. The Genetic algorithm is quite a popular method because it is used to find the best place in the cover image to insert watermark in order to achieve robustness and imperceptibility both.

It can store information and can also switch between different states. It is a two terminal device. This type of memories would not lose its data even when the power is switched off. Recently Memristor's applications lie even in complex and interesting areas like Artificial Intelligence. Memristor's can be used to model human brain since its properties is more similar to synapses. Therefore with the help of synapse as Memristor and neurons as a CMOS control circuit, the entire brain can be modeled and fabricated on a single chip. Memristor can replace the power consuming transistors which can be productive in creating a logic circuit. This allows flexibility in using a circuit both for storage purpose and logical operations simultaneously. Memories are usually designed based on the crossbar architecture, where a single switching cell (1Memristor in our case) is placed at the cross-points of word line and bit line. The main finding of this work is that, when this model is applied to a crossbar structure, there is no resistance change except the desired one because of its voltage control nature in comparison to other models. As a result we are avoiding the undesired current the so called sneak current along with reducing the circuit elements i.e. the technique involved in a complete arrest of sneak path current like complementary resistive switching or connecting a diode for each cell as in other models (Linear ion Drift model, TEAM model) for memory operation. The reduction in circuit elements has helped in enhancing the density, making the design less complex and reduction in die area. © 2017 IEEE.","Crossbar memory architecture; Memristor; Non-volatile memory; Sneak path; voltage controlled","Brain; Computer circuits; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Memory architecture; Memristors; Nonvolatile storage; RRAM; Crossbar architecture; Low-power consumption; Memristor; Non-volatile memory; Resistive random access memory; Sneak path; Two-terminal devices; Voltage-controlled; Random access storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

The storage of these data requires massive memory. For communication, these data need enormous transmission bandwidth. The only solution to reduce the storage and the transmission bandwidth is the data compression. From the literature survey it is learnt that there is a need to achieve compression ratio greater than 30 with a PSNR greater than 25 dB for non critical applications. In order to facilitate this, a colour image compression method is proposed. In this method, the colour image is converted into the 'YCbCr' format using formulated New Equation Set-1. The 'Y' component matrix is divided into 16×16 blocks. The DCT is applied to all the 16×16 blocks. The DC-Coefficient of all 16×16 block DCT is taken out and zero is inserted in place of it. The data types of all the DC-coefficients are changed from the 'double' to the '16 bit integer' data type and they are stored. The transformed matrix consists of 16×16 block DCT of all the blocks. In this matrix, all those elements less than the threshold value 'th' are made zero. This matrix is decomposed into matrices 'U', 'S' and 'V' using SVD. All those elements of the matrix 'U' less than the threshold value 'thu', all those elements of the matrix 'S' less than the threshold value 'ths' and all those elements of the matrix 'V' less than the threshold value 'thv' are made zero. Then these matrices are multiplied to form one matrix such that X=USVT. All those elements of the matrix 'X' less than the threshold value 'th' are made zero. Now all the elements of the matrix 'X' are divided by 10. Then the matrix 'X' becomes a sparse matrix. This sparse matrix is represented in the 'triplet form'. The data types of the 'row values' and the 'column values' of the triplet form are converted from the 'double' to the '16 bit integer' data type. The data type of the 'data elements' of the 'triplet form' is converted into the '8 bit integer' data type. Then the RLE is applied to the 'column values' of the 'triplet form'. After this, the compressed form of the Y-Component Matrix is obtained. Similarly, the 'Cb' and the 'Cr' component matrices are compressed. Then the experiments are conducted by converting the given image into the 'YCbCr' format by the formulated New Equation Set-2, New Equation Set-3 and the basic 'YCbCr' equation. The results are compared with parameters such as Compression Ratio, PSNR, SSIM and Quality Index. Experiments are conducted using MATLAB. From the results, it can be concluded that, the compression ratio obtained from the method which has got the colour conversion using New Equation Set-1 is good. The maximum compression ratio obtained with this method is 43.5079 with a PSNR of Red, Green and Blue Component equal to 25.9583 dB, 25.7501 dB and 26.4837 dB respectively. © 2017 IEEE.","2DDCT-Two Dimension Discrete Cosine Transform; CR-Compression Ratio; DC-Direct Current; DCT-Discrete Cosine Transform; PSNR-Peak Signal to Noise Ratio; RLE-Run Length Encoding; SSIM-Structural Similarity Index Measure; SVD-Singular Value Decomposition","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Color; Digital storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Image coding; Image compression; MATLAB; Signal to noise ratio; Singular value decomposition; Uranium; Wave transmission; DCT-discrete cosine transform; Direct current; Peak signal to noise ratio; Run-length encoding; Structural similarity index measures; Two-dimension; Matrix algebra",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059126,,,"English","Int.

These are attractive due to their low static power consumption, higher density and good scalability. However, expensive write operations in these NVMs reduces their chances as a substitute for SRAM. To handle these expensive write operations, cache is designed as a hybrid cache consisting of different memory technologies. This paper proposes a block prediction technique for hybrid cache that is based on existing prediction mechanism. The hybrid cache has a smaller SRAM partition which may limit the amount of cache capacity. This is overcome by increasing or decreasing the associativity dynamically. The proposed policy is compared with the baseline SRAM and STT-RAM caches.

The cores in a CMP has a private cache and a shared LLC whose size increases with each process generation. It has been observed that for different application on average 24% of the blocks are privately owned by the cores, and that the copies of these blocks in the LLC are redundant. This suggests that one needs to maintain only the tag portion of such private blocks in the LLC. Existing research has attempted to do this by partitioning the cache into tag-only and tag+data storage sections. This reduces the overall area of the LLC, but can degrade the performance to some extent. The tag-only storage stores the tags of the private blocks and if there are more such blocks in a set then these occupy the ways from the tag+data part. Thus, the chances of tag+data blocks staying in the cache reduces, affecting the performance. In this paper we propose to rectify the performance degradation by allowing more storage for the tag-only as well as tag+data parts. This is done by dynamically increasing the associativity of the sets. Experimental evaluation shows significant performance improvement with comparable area savings. © 2016 IEEE.","Chip Multiprocessors; Dynamic associativity; Last-level Cache; Private blocks","Adaptive systems; Multiprocessing systems; VLSI circuits; Associativity; Chip Multiprocessor; Chip multiprocessors; Experimental evaluation; Last-level caches; Lastlevel caches (LLC); Performance degradation; Private blocks; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509014224,,,"English","Int.

User level security mechanism helps to improve security and user's trust in adopting the cloud data services. In our system we have implemented online data encryption mechanism. It is used at user level in which data to be uploaded to cloud storage is encrypted at the time of uploading. Online data encryption helps to fasten the process and saves user's time. To provide better data access control we have used a strong data security technique in which user's data identification credential and salt is used. Data identification credential, partial element of cipher key, is outsourced to cloud for further use in data decryption process. Decryption process is performed at the user level with the help of salt and one time password.

This emerging field of big data analytic has driven the researcher worldwide toward design, development and implementation of various tools, technologies, architecture and platforms for analyzing the huge volume of data generated day to day. Big data consist of data sets which is difficult for legacy database management system to analysis. This paper details some analysis like feedback analysis, sentiment analysis and word-count. Feedback are important for the system enhancement, finding loop holes and as well as for proper work distribution. Feedback is valuable information that will be used to make good decision. Feedback is important not only when it highlights weaknesses but also for strengths. If analysis of feedback is done in wrong way then the result of analysis will also be wrong. As a result, the pattern identified will also be incorrect thus making the whole system incorrect as a whole.

Road conditions in developing countries like India are chaotic where roads are not well maintained and thus vehicular sensors alone do not suffice in detecting impending collisions. In this paper, we investigate a collaborative driver assistance system ""DRIZY: DRIve eaSY"" for such scenarios where inference is drawn from on-board camera feed to alert drivers of obstacles ahead and the cloud uses GPS sensor data uploaded by all vehicles to alert drivers of vehicles in potential collision trajectory. Thus, we combine computer vision and vehicle-to-cloud communication to create comprehensive situational awareness. We prototype our system to consider two types of collisions: vehicle-to-vehicle collisions based on uploading GPS sensor data of vehicles to cloud and vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions based on detecting pedestrians from vehicle's dashboard camera feed. Sensor data processing in each vehicle occurs on smartphone for GPS values which are then uploaded to cloud and on raspberry pi3 for video feeds to make a cost-effective solution. Experiments over both 4G and wireless networks in India show that collaborative driver assistance is feasible in low traffic density within acceptable driver reaction time of <5 sec, but can be limited by the time to process compute-intensive video feeds in real-time. We investigate novel ways to optimize the processing tofi nd an acceptable trade-off. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Driver assistance system; Edge computing; HOG+SVM sliding-window optimization; Pedestrian detection; Vehicle-to-cloud communication","Automobile drivers; Cameras; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Developing countries; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Economic and social effects; Mobile computing; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Wireless networks; Cloud communications; Driver assistance system; Edge computing; Pedestrian detection; Sliding Window; Vehicle to vehicle communications",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450349161,,,"English","Proc Annu Int Conf Mobile Comput Networking",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034114909

In recent years, surveillance systems are widely used in all places starting from border security application to street monitoring systems. As the analysis of surveillance video becomes one of the most emerging trends and research fields of interest, there is a need for a comprehensive survey on various works being carried out in the field. A single surveillance camera records the happenings in a particular field of view both day and night at all time, likewise multi-camera environment generates a huge volume of data. Though motion sensitivity based cameras considerably reduce the storage volume, they still produce large volume of data when employed in busy areas. The large amount of video data cannot be fully observed for analysis as it is time overwhelming process. Hence it is required to summarize the activities in the scene and detect unusual events recorded in videos. Hence, this paper discusses various techniques for summarization and unusual event detection in video and it presents current scenario of research in this area.

Improved Micro partitioning is a modularized approach of cloud computing mainly framed to overcome the pitfalls in the traditional search engine and also in manipulation of large information stored in a single computer. The Map Reduce Task Scheduling algorithm which has been used in the cloud helps in overcoming the challenges of conventional methodologies. The map reduce protocol model is a simple model that makes the data to save in different locations by partitioning the data technique.

Yet, it is well known that such systems can provide aggregate reliability via information redundancy, duplicating paths, or replicating computations. While redundancy may increase the load on a system, it can also lead to major performance improvements through the judicious management of additional system resources. Two important examples of this abstract paradigm are content access from multiple caches in content delivery networks and master/slave computations on compute clusters. Many recent articles in the area have proposed bounds on the latency performance of redundant systems, characterizing the latency-redundancy tradeoff under specific load profiles. Following a similar line of research, this article introduces new analytical bounds and approximation techniques for the latency-redundancy tradeoff for a range of system loads and two popular redundancy schemes. The proposed framework allows for approximating the equilibrium latency distribution, from which various metrics can be derived including mean, variance, and the tail decay of stationary distributions. © 2017 IEEE.","Content delivery networks; Data storage; Distributed storage systems; Equilibrium distribution; Forward error correction; Markov processes; Queueing analysis; Waiting time","Abstracting; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Error correction; Forward error correction; Markov processes; Multiprocessing systems; Content delivery network; Data storage; Distributed storage system; Equilibrium distributions; Queueing analysis; Waiting-time; Redundancy",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",0743166X,9781509053360,PINFE,,"English","Proc IEEE INFOCOM",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034116719

Generation of large data sets demand for a high performance search algorithm in areas such as text mining, information retrieval and many others. The popularity of GPU’s for general purpose computing has been increasing for various applications. Therefore it is of great interest to exploit the thread feature of a GPU to provide a high performance search algorithm. This paper proposes an optimized new approach to N-gram model for string search in a number of lengthy documents and its GPU implementation. The algorithm exploits GPGPUs for searching strings in many documents employing character level N-gram matching with parallel Score Table approach and search using CUDA API. The new approach of Score table used for frequency storage of N-grams in a document, makes the search independent of the document’s length and allows faster access to the frequency values, thus decreasing the search complexity. The extensive thread feature in a GPU has been exploited to enable parallel pre-processing of trigrams in a document for Score Table creation and parallel search in huge number of documents, thus speeding up the whole search process even for a large pattern size. Experiments were carried out for many documents of varied length and search strings from the standard Lorem Ipsum text on NVIDIA’s GeForce GT 540M GPU with 96 cores. Results prove that the parallel approach for Score Table creation and searching gives a good speed up than the same approach executed serially. © 2017, The Institution of Engineers (India).","CUDA; GPGPU; N-gram; NVIDIA; Score table; String matching; String searching; Trigram","Big data; Data mining; Digital storage; Graphics processing unit; Learning algorithms; Program processors; CUDA; GPGPU; N-grams; NVIDIA; Score table; String matching; String-searching; Tri grams; String searching algorithms","Srinivasa, K.G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, M.S.

In delay tolerant network packets storage exists when there is any link breakage between the nodes in the network so delay is tolerable in this type of network during the data transmission. But this delay is not tolerable in wireless network for voice packet transmission. This evokes the use of wireless networks. In a network, different wireless network topologies are interoperating with each other so the communication across the network is called overlay network. This network is vulnerable to attacks due to mobile behaviour of nodes and frequent changes in topologies of the network. The attacks are wormhole attack and blackhole attack is analysed in this paper. They are critical threats to normal operation in wireless networks which results in the degradation of the network performance.

A huge portion of available minerals and materials is in the form of fine powder that makes their management and utilization a tedious job. Pelletization, a size enlargement technique, is used to tackle aforementioned problems and provides benefits such as ease of handling and storage, convenient transportation and improved process efficiency. Besides other characteristics, pellet size and strength are of prime significance and their accurate estimation can enhance the product quality. Real-life constraints (e.g., time in conducting experiments, repetition of experiments considering measurement errors, availability of resources, etc.) pose difficulties in generating sufficient experimental data at the laboratory. Hence, the concept of random population generation of genetic algorithm is exploited to fulfill data requirement where fitness functions are formulated using multiple regression. Better visualisation of pellets attributes and operating conditions is done through self-organizing map which also helped in deducing some important facts. Sensitivity analysis and construction of learning curves is also performed in present study. Finally, multilayer perceptron, a popular supervised neural network model, is applied on synthetic data to approximate pellet properties.

Besides strengthening the data authentication, integrity, non-repudiation properties, the computational overhead is also reduced in extracting the required keys without any uncertainty. Moreover, effort has been extended to sustain proper signal quality and restrict unauthorized tampering during wireless communication. The first phase of the algorithm describes collection of a digitized signature from a legitimate source; conversion of the pixels of the digitized signature into white or black form based on a threshold comparison result; formation of two shares by representing a pixel value as a combination of two pairs; conversion of the digital cover signal to two distinct frequency levels and casting of one of the shares in high frequency coefficients of the two distinct levels concurrently. The second phase explains appropriate detection of the fabricated share and a user and the proprietary document are authenticated by superimposing the detected share on the second share. The selection of a suitable threshold value to clean the digitized signature and control the share casting intensity helps in considerable reduction of the undesired white noise. The robustness of DWT in narrowband interferences in wireless communication supports its use in the proposed approach. The pseudorandom fabrication position supports visual secret sharing to safeguard the communicating parties from any suspicion.

By migrating the data to cloud storage, the consumers can be liberated from building and maintaining the private storage infrastructure, and they can enjoy the data storage service at anywhere and anytime with high reliability and a relatively low cost. However, the security and privacy risks, especially the confidentiality and integrity of data seem to be the biggest hurdle to the adoption of the cloud storage applications. In this paper, we consider the secure data access and sharing issues for cloud storage services. Based on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem, we design a secure data access and data sharing scheme for cloud storage, where we utilize the user authentication scheme to deal with the data access problem. According to our analysis, through our scheme, only valid user with the correct password and biometric can access to the cloud storage provider. Besides, the authorized users can access the rightful resources and verify the validity of the shared data, but cannot transfer the permission to any other party. At the same time, the confidentiality and integrity of data can be guaranteed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Cloud storage; Data sharing; Password; User authentication","Authentication; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Security of data; Cloud storage services; Cloud storages; Data Sharing; Discrete logarithm problems; Password; Storage infrastructure; User authentication; User authentication scheme; Digital storage","Shen, J.; School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and TechnologyChina; email: s_shenjian@126.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989211564

However, integrity and confidentiality of the data in cloud remains a challenge issue due to the loss of data possession. As a solution, some public data auditing schemes have been proposed in last several years. Most recently, Li et al. proposed an efficient public auditing scheme and claimed that it could reduce the cost of clients on generating verification metadata. In this paper, we analyze the security of Li et al.’s scheme and point out two weaknesses in it. We demonstrate that it cannot achieve the confidentiality for outsourced data and it is vulnerable to the proof forgery attack. To address these weaknesses, we propose an improved public auditing scheme, which can not only preserve the data privacy but also resist the proof forgery attack. Security analysis shows that our scheme is provably secure in a robust security model. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can overcome the weaknesses in Li et al.’s scheme at the cost of increasing computation overhead slightly. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.","Cloud storage; Outsourced data; Privacy preserving; Public integrity auditing; Smart city","Digital storage; Lithium; Metadata; Printing machinery; Smart city; City construction; Cloud storages; Computation overheads; Outsourced datum; Performance analysis; Privacy preserving; Public integrity auditing; Security analysis; Data privacy","He, D.; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security, Guilin University Of Electronic TechnologyChina; email: hedebiao@163.com",,"Springer London",16174909,,,,"English","Pers.

A new technique which assembles the encryption key and biometric sample using a cryptographic means is the fuzzy vault. The fuzzy vault scheme provides supreme security to the templates which are stored in a database or smart card. Compared to an ordinary system which stores the templates as such without any protection, the protection enabled by this fuzzy vault system is tremendous. It is almost impossible for an attacker to guess any information out of the fuzzy vault regarding fingerprint templates. But still some kind of attacks such as correlation attack, Attacks via record multiplicity and Blended substitution attack can be launched on the fuzzy vault, which is stored in a database. Among them Blended substitution attack is the major one, which is still unresolved. Hence in this paper the Blended substitution attack is launched by corrupting the fuzzy vault data with a random data and the attack is determined using the statistical features of the fuzzy vault data and the fuzzy vault is self recovered back after the attack without any user's re-enrollment again, by storing the genuine points of the vault which corresponds to fingerprint features set in a server, which is assumed to be connected with the vault database continuously. © 2016 IEEE.","AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key; BS (Blended substitution); Chaff points; CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check); Fuzzy vault; Genuine points; Minutiae","Biometrics; Computer circuits; Data privacy; Database systems; Digital storage; Smart cards; Advanced Encryption Standard; Chaff points; Cyclic redundancy check; Fuzzy vault; Genuine points; Minutiae; Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053698,,,"English","Int.

For prolonged network operational time, energy conservation is a critical issue in routing protocol design in ad-hoc wireless networks. Regardless of the energy saving issues, the conventional AODV routing protocol uses smallest hop count as the main metric to calculate the best path for routing the data packets to its destination. Major source of energy cost in a routing protocol is the energy used to transmit the data packets. For this purpose, we consider the problem of adjusting the transmission power of the nodes to an optimal power level and incorporate low power consumption strategies into the routing protocol through upward information flow cross-layer model between MAC Layer and Network Layer. Using QualNet 5.2 as the simulation tool, we evaluate the performance of our proposed energy efficient cross-layer design to AODV, which is named as Cross Layer Energy Efficient AODV (CLEE-AODV). We investigate by implementing the required changes in the route discovery process using cross-layer approach in the AODV. Simulation results show our proposed cross-layer routing protocol offers performance enhancement as compared to AODV in terms of total transmission power, energy efficiency, energy consumption per node, and throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","AODV; cross-layer design; energy conservation; mobile ad-hoc networks","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network layers; Network routing; Power management; Routing protocols; Signal processing; Wireless ad hoc networks; Ad hoc wireless networks; AODV; AODV routing protocol; Cross-layer design; Cross-layer modeling; Low-power consumption; Performance enhancements; Route discovery process; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

But like other wireless networks WSN is also prone to adversary interventions. So the researchers are addressing this issue to make routing protocols secure for communication. But due to the severe resource constraints on sensor nodes like limited battery life and limited storage capacity prevents the traditional complex security mechanisms to be employed on the sensor nodes. In this paper we propose a new routing algorithm called Secure Energy Aware Multipath Routing with Key Management (SEAM-KM) in Wireless Sensor Network. This protocol focuses on using a base station as the central control block for all kinds of computation like shortest path selection, routing table generation, Updating the routing table and distribution of pair wise keys among the sensor nodes and the base station. Leaving the energy consuming computations to be performed by the base station, the lifetime of the sensor nodes can be prolonged. Moreover distribution of pair wise keys among sensor nodes provides security among sensor nodes and also increases the resilience of the network. This protocol is resistive to some of the specific attacks which rely on forming attractive routes to lure the sensor nodes to communicate through the already compromised nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","Dijkstra's algorithm; Energy efficiency; Key Management; Multipath routing; Security","Base stations; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Network security; Power management; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Compromised nodes; Critical environment; Dijkstra's algorithms; Key management; Multi path routing; Resource Constraint; Security; Security mechanism; Power management (telecommunication)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509027972,,,"English","Int.

However, all existing works on data dissemination consider transferring small-sized data, where the entire data can be transferred from a roadside unit (RSU) to a vehicle when the vehicle is passing by it. In this paper, we address the problem of large data transfers among vehicles in a VANET using RSUs and vehicles with finite data storage and transfer capacity. In particular, we formulate two problems, the Maximum Successful Transfers Problem Using RSUs (R-MaxSucTrans) that aims to maximize the number of successful transfers between source and destination vehicles using only RSUs as intermediate nodes, and the Maximum Successful Transfers Problem Using RSUs and Vehicles (RV-MaxSucTrans) that aims to do the same while using both RSUs and other vehicles as intermediate nodes. Offline algorithms are proposed for the two problems. Detailed simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.","Data dissemination; Large data; VANET","Ad hoc networks; Data transfer; Digital storage; Information dissemination; Vehicles; Data dissemination; Intermediate node; Large data; Large Data Transfers; Off-line algorithm; Roadside units; Transfer capacities; VANET; Vehicular ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509029914,,,"English","Int.

A common approach to processing and consuming IoT data is a centralized paradigm: sensor data is sent over the network to a comparatively powerful central server or a cloud service, where all processing takes place. However, this approach has some limitations as it requires devices to interact directly with a cloud which is not cost effective. First, it has high demands on the device's storage and computational capabilities. Second, as devices grow rapidly in a deployment area, sending all the data to a centralized cloud server requires high network bandwidth. Moreover, this often creates data privacy concerns as all raw data will be sent to a centralized place. To address the above limitations for building future Internet of Things applications, we present an early design of a novel framework that combines Internet of Things, Semantic Web, and Big Data concepts. We not only present the core components to build an IoT system, but also list existing alternatives with their merits. This framework aims to incorporate open standards to address the potential challenges in building future IoT applications. Therefore, our discussion revolves around open standards to build the framework, rather than proprietary standards. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Internet of Things; Semantic Web; Semantic Web of Things; Web of Things","Big data; Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Data privacy; Digital storage; Network function virtualization; Semantic Web; Standards; Central servers; Computational capability; Future internet; Internet of Things (IOT); IOT applications; Network bandwidth; Privacy concerns; Proprietary standards; Internet of things",,"Bahsoon R.Chen Z.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538620021,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE World Congr.

It has various configuration parameters which play an important role in deciding the performance i.e., the execution time of a given big data processing job. Default values of these parameters do not result in good performance and therefore it is important to tune them. However, there is inherent difficulty in tuning the parameters due to two important reasons-first, the parameter search space is large and second, there are cross-parameter interactions. Hence, there is a need for a dimensionality-free method which can automatically tune the configuration parameters by taking into account the cross-parameter dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Hadoop parameter tuning methodology, based on a noisy gradient algorithm known as the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The SPSA algorithm tunes the selected parameters by directly observing the performance of the Hadoop MapReduce system. The approach followed is independent of parameter dimensions and requires only 2 observations per iteration while tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in achieving good performance on popular Hadoop benchmarks namely Grep, Bigram, Inverted Index, Word Co-occurrence and Terasort. Our method, when tested on a 25 node Hadoop cluster shows 45-66% decrease in execution time of Hadoop jobs on an average, when compared to prior methods. Further, our experiments also indicate that the parameters tuned by our method are resilient to changes in number of cluster nodes, which makes our method suitable to optimize Hadoop when it is provided as a service on the cloud. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Hadoop Parameter Tuning; Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation","Approximation algorithms; Approximation theory; Benchmarking; Big data; Cloud computing; Data handling; Digital storage; Iterative methods; Network function virtualization; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Configuration parameters; Distributed storage; Parameter dependency; Parameter interactions; Parameter search space; Parameter-tuning; Scalable performance; Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation; Parameter estimation",,"Fox G.C.","IEEE Computer Society",21596182,9781538619933,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Increased adoptions can be attributed to their high bandwidth, low latency and excellent random I/O performance. Owing to this high performance, multiple I/O intensive services can now be co-located on the same server. SSDs also introduce periodic latency spikes due to garbage collection. This, combined with multi-tenancy increases latency unpredictability since co-located applications now compete for CPU, memory, and disk bandwidth. The combination of these latency spikes and unpredictability lead to long tail latencies that can significantly decrease the system performance at scale. In this paper, we present a rack-level scheduling algorithm, which dynamically detects and shifts workloads with long tail latencies within servers in the same rack. Different from the global resource management methods, rack-level scheduling utilizes lightweight containers to minimize data movement and message passing overheads, leading to a much more efficient solution to reduce tail latency.With the algorithms implemented in the storage driver of the containerization infrastructure, it becomes viable to deploy and migrate applications in existing server racks without extensive modifications to storage, OS and other subsystems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Containers; Digital storage; Message passing; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Ubiquitous computing; Co-located; Data movements; Disk bandwidth; Garbage collection; Global resources; High bandwidth; Low latency; Multi tenancies; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538634868,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Those advances encompass the ever increasing innovative digital and remote mobile devices being operated on the users’ end. Due to the openness of critical system, the service providers in such networks are facing security challenges to authenticate those mobile devices on the field, and delivering services. In this scenario, the Multi-server authentication (MSA) framework seems to be a promising solution that enables its subscribers to avail services from different servers without getting registered to each server individually. In last few years many MSA protocols depending on RC-Offline authentication during mutual authentication, have been presented. However, to date, there is no efficient MSA scheme to our knowledge that is free of all three weaknesses, simultaneously. That is, 1) free from storage of server-based parameters (public keys or other values) in smart card by registration authority, 2) free from the assumption of publishing of server-based public keys publicly and 3) free from a single secret sharing with all servers so that it could avoid server masquerading (insider) attack. Considering these limitations, we present a multi-server authentication protocol that withstands above drawbacks using lightweight cryptographic operations. The rationale of the proposed work was to present an efficient RC-Offline MSA scheme. Our scheme is also backed by formal security analysis based on GNY logic and automated security verification using ProVerif tool. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Attacks; Cryptanalysis; Cryptography; Information security; Multi-server authentication","Big data; Cryptography; Digital devices; Digital storage; Mobile security; Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Smart cards; Attacks; Authenticated key agreement; Cryptanalysis; Cryptographic operations; Formal security analysis; Multi-server; Security verification; Technological advances; Authentication","Kumari, S.; Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, International Islamic UniversityPakistan; email: saryusiirohi@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028806564

The classification of the images is one of the effective ways to manage and retrieve images. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale multimedia image data classification algorithm based on deep learning. We firstly select the image characteristics to represent the flag for retrieval, which represents the color, texture and shape characteristics respectively. A feature of color is the most basic image data, mainly including the average brightness, color histogram and dominant color, etc. What the texture refers to is the image data in the anomalous, macroscopic as well as orderly one key character that on partial has. The contour feature extraction of image data needs to rely on the edge detection, edge of the detected edge through the connection or grouping to form a meaningful image event. Secondly, we revise the convolutional neural network model based on the pooling operation optimization, the pooling is in the process of the convolution operation to extract the image characteristics of the different locations to gather statistics. Furthermore, we integrate the parallel and could storage strategy to enhance the efficiency of the proposed methodology. The performance of the algorithm is verified, compared with the other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed one obtains the better efficiency and accuracy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image data classification; Information retrieval; Large-scale system; Multimedia architecture","Classification (of information); Color; Convolution; Data mining; Digital storage; Edge detection; Efficiency; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image processing; Information retrieval; Large scale systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Search engines; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image characteristics; Image data; Multimedia architecture; Operation optimization; Shape characteristics; State-of-the-art approach; Image texture","Li, J.; Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: lijuncas@163.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009863270

Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency, and delay that is caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed. The first and most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput. To this end, we need an evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a repeatable manner. In this paper we propose a simulator, called iFogSim, to model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and cost. We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT environment and comparison of resource management policies. Moreover, scalability of the simulation toolkit of RAM consumption and execution time is verified under different circumstances.

Resource Description Framework (RDF), mainly developed for Semantic Web, is presumably a good option when considering graph databases dealing with huge real-world data. RDF models information in the form of triples <subject, predicate, object>, and is considered as a useful tool to store graph data (aka linked data) where each edge can be stored as a triple. Due to existence of huge amount of linked data, mostly in the form of graphs, graph mining has been successful in attracting researchers from different research €elds for efficient handling (storage, indexing, retrieval, etc.) of graph data. As a result, various APIs like GraphX and GraphFrames are developed to facilitate relational queries over graph data. Though GraphX is older than GraphFrames and processing SPARQL queries over GraphX has been explored by some researchers, to the best of our knowledge, SPARQL query processing over GraphFrames has not been explored yet. In this paper, we present an initial study on query-specific search space pruning and query optimization approach to process SPARQL queries over GraphFrames in an efficient manner,e experimental results, in terms of low response time for query execution, are encouraging, and give way to invest more research efforts in this direction. © 2017 ACM.","Graph mining; Graphframes; GraphX; Linked data mining; SPARQL query processing","Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Query languages; Query processing; Semantic Web; Data management system; Graph mining; Graphframes; GraphX; Linked datum; Query optimization approaches; Resource description framework; Search space pruning; Information management",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450349512,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/WIC/ACM Int.

Privacy protection of additional data as well as cover media makes it attractive for applications in medical imaging, cloud storage, forensics etc. In this paper, a new method for reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI), is proposed. Our method adopts the approach of reserving sufficient space for the additional data before encrypting the cover image. First we identify suitable blocks for hiding data from various parts of the image. Before encrypting the image, one or more LSB-planes of these blocks are backed-up into remaining parts of the image using a high-performing traditional RDH method that works on unencrypted images. After encrypting the image, those LSB-planes are used to hide additional data. Recovery of original cover image and error-free extraction of additional data is guaranteed always. Moreover, the proposed method is simple and intuitive. Experimentally results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for reversible data hiding in encrypted images. © 2017 IEEE.","encryption; histogram; interpolation; reservation; Reversible data hiding","Cryptography; Digital storage; Interpolation; Medical imaging; Steganography; Additional datum; Encrypted images; histogram; Privacy protection; Research communities; reservation; Reversible data hiding; State-of-the-art methods; Image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

Communication is done using wired media as well as wireless media. While communicating through wireless media data security plays a major role. Data security is mainly concerned with ensuring security during communication, transmission as well as in data storage. To protect data from intentional internal security breaches and unauthorized access from external user's cryptography is most widely used. Cryptography conceals the content of original message from all others except recipient and sender. At the recipient side, with no intervention of sender data will be decrypted into its original form with the help of key. Only by using the key the data will be transformed from unintelligible form to intelligible form. By using different algorithms keys are generated. If the algorithm is too complex and consumes more time to extrapolate the key then the algorithm used for providing data security is said to be stronger. Algorithm used for extrapolation of key should be difficult for hackers to reveal the key. In the proposed algorithm middle bit of the original data is taken as key. These bits are not transformed to any other form during the encryption. To enhance the security logical operations and Rail fence algorithm is applied. © 2017 IEEE.","2's complement; Ciphertext; Decryption; Encryption; Key Entrenching; Logical XNOR; Transposition","Digital storage; Extrapolation; Personal computing; 2's complement; Ciphertexts; Decryption; Key Entrenching; Logical XNOR; Transposition; Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

Heterogeneous distributed systems are often considered as a combination of public and private cloud systems, mobile based clusters and networks. Many schedulers and scheduling algorithm lacks reliability requirements for tasks and execution fails due to allocation of tasks to incongruous resources. Intelligent resource utilization is the key to deal with variable demand loads and therefore scheduling algorithms should be able to employ effective resource utilization techniques and also exploit additional resources if there is demand in resources. We propose an intelligent data-aware scheduler which enhances data-locality scheduling and also provides fairness in shared heterogeneous workloads.

An image is a cover object that hides the secret data. DNA is another cover object which has a huge data storage capacity and it hides a very large secret data by replacing the bases which are of huge numbers to a particular DNA. In this study, the various techniques that are applied for hiding a secret message in different cover objects like image and DNA are summarized and the integrity of the secret message in various mediums are discussed. The combination of DNA and Images used together to hide a secret message or data is known as dual cover steganography; here the cover objects are DNA and Image.

The big data were generated from activities, sensing devices, mobile devices, Internet, RFID readers etc. One of the key sources of big data is the data from the sensor. The significant amounts of the data from the sensor are either redundant or almost similar. It initiates the requirement of de-duplication of the sensor data. The data from the sensors need to be stored for further process or analysis which requires end-to-end security for the data. A method is proposed in this paper for detecting the similar data with light-weight process using pattern analysis and matching. The distributed encoding process is proposed here for imposing end-to-end security for the generated data with reduced communication overhead. The data received in the processing server are decoded, analyzed and matched with patterns for removing similar and duplicated data. The result shows that the proposed system secures data during transmission with light-weighted processes. The duplicated and similar data are detected efficiently through inline process before the data enter into the storage.

Currently, organizations produce a large amount of data and expect increased availability, scalability and security. When data is migrated to cloud, security and availability of the data must be verified since the critical data of the organizations lies outside the data owner premises. To enhance the availability of the data the data owners prefer replicating data to more than one cloud servers. Thus there will be pre-defined SLAs between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the data owners that include payment of fees measured in terms of GB per month for data replication. We need to have a protocol which ensures that the cloud service provider is replicating the data storage based on the pre defined SLAs. In this paper we propose a protocol called “Secure Provable Data Possession scheme with Replication support in the Cloud using Tweaks” that prevents the CSP cheating the data owner by maintaining fewer replicas than the agreed one in the SLAs and also supports dynamic data operations. We illustrate the performance of our scheme with experimental analysis and prove that it performs better than the existing systems. © 2017 The Author(s)","Cloud computing; Data outsourcing; Provable data possession; Replication; Tweaks","Cloud computing; Distributed database systems; Outsourcing; Societies and institutions; Cloud service providers; Computing facilities; Data outsourcing; Existing systems; Experimental analysis; Provable data possessions; Replication; Tweaks; Digital storage","Ali, S.A.; Department of Information Technology, Velammal Engineering College, Anna UniversityIndia; email: haiahamed@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027721983

Speed control of an AC motor is required for several industrial applications, but is often difficult to achieve as the AC motor runs at fixed speed. Hence, power electronic devices are introduced in the system. Due to the development in power electronic devices with improved dependability and cheaper cost, results in the growth of modern variable frequency drive (VFD) which can control the speed of an induction motor by adjusting the frequency of the machine [8]. They produce harmonic components and distort the supply mains, which in turn adversely affect the power quality. To outlive the difficulty, a technique named multi-pulse rectifier is developed. The main objective of this work is to reduce the impact of harmonic distortion using variable frequency drives (VFDs). Modeling, simulation and performance analysis of VFD is done based on Total harmonic distortion (THD) [8]. The proposed topology deals with the THD comparison for 6, 12 and 24 pulses.

Nowadays use of internet has increased tremendously. As a result of it Digital media gathers maximum amount of confidential data. To maintain the secrecy over confidential data, different methods of hiding have been evolved. Steganography is one of the emergent area where maintaining the privacy of secret data is of utmost importance. It is an art of hiding the secret data or confidential information inside the digitally covered information. In this paper we proposed a new technique of video steganography by implementing cover frame pixel randomization, de-randomization and data embedding technique which maintain the quality of the secret data(video file) and prevents it from being accessed by intruders while communication through an open channel. Here we have proposed a new technique using factorization method to scramble pixels of cover frames of cover video file. Then the frames of secret video file is inserted in the scrambled cover frame of cover video file using Spiral (Extended) LSB technique. This method of hiding the secret video in the cover video gives a new security concept of securing the secret data from unauthorized accesses. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is used to measure the quality of stegovideo. Thus this new approach of video steganography shows a very high imperceptibility to human vision and hence is quite efficient. © 2017 IEEE.","Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio(PSNR); Pixel Randomization Using Factorization Method; Spiral (extended) LSB technique; Steganography","Digital storage; Factorization; Pixels; Random processes; Signal to noise ratio; Confidential data; Confidential information; Data embedding; Factorization methods; Lsb techniques; Peak signal to noise ratio; Unauthorized access; Video steganography; Steganography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509047086,,,"English","Int.

SAMOA stands for scalable advanced massive online analysis, is a machine learning framework used to perform distributed data mining over streaming data. Vertical Hoeffding Tree (VHT) under SAMOA is a variant of very fast decision tree used for distributed classification of data streams. The performance of VHT depends on various critical parameters such as tie-threshold, grace value, confidence, split criterion, etc. Although, VHT is widely accepted as an efficient streaming classifier but one of the challenges in streaming classification is varying distribution of incoming data instances with respect to underlying classes in different datasets; therefore performance of VHT varies in different datasets. Therefore, achieving optimal performance from the stream classifier like VHT on different datasets is a challenging task and fixed set of values of critical parameters cannot be preconfigured for various types of datasets. This research work explores the capabilities of VHT streaming classifier of SAMOA in the light of various benchmarking performance statistics such as classification accuracy, kappa and kappa temporal. The work presented here, experimentally identifies suitable values of critical parameters of VHT that yield optimized performance on different datasets. Thus, this analytical study is extremely significant in developing streaming classifiers which achieve optimum performance via parameter tuning at run time. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Massive online analysis; SAMOA; Streaming data classification; Streaming data mining; Vertical Hoeffding Tree; VFDT; VHT","Benchmarking; Big data; Data communication systems; Data mining; Decision trees; Digital storage; Trees (mathematics); On-line analysis; SAMOA; Streaming data; Vertical Hoeffding Tree; VFDT; Classification (of information)","Prasad, B.R.; Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, Jhalwa, India; email: rs151@iiita.ac.in",,"Springer Verlag",18688071,,,,"English","Intl.

Some applications also compute UDFs on the joined tuples. The join can be done at the data storage nodes, corresponding to reduce side joins, or by fetching data from the storage system to compute nodes, corresponding to map side join. Both may be suboptimal: reduce side joins may cause skew, while map side joins may lead to a lot of data being transferred and replicated. In this paper, we present techniques to make runtime decisions between the two options on a per key basis, in order to improve the throughput of the join, accounting for UDF computation if any. Our techniques are based on an extended ski-rental algorithm and provide worst-case performance guarantees with respect to the optimal point in the space considered by us.

To perform load balancing techniques in cloud computing environments, various challenges such as data security, and proper distribution exist which requires serious attention. The most important challenge posed by cloud applicationsis the provision of Quality of Service (QoS) provision as it develops the problem of resource allocation to the application so as to guarantee a service level along dimensions such as performance, availability and reliability. A centralized hierarchical Cloud-based Multimedia System (CMS) consisting of a resource manager, cluster heads, and server clusters is being considered by which the resource manager assigns clients’ requests to server clusters for performing multimedia service tasks based on the job features after which each the job is assigned to the servers within its server cluster by the cluster head. Designing an effective load balancing algorithm for CMS however being a complicated and challenging task, enables spreading of multimedia service job load on servers at the minimal cost for transmitting multimedia data between server clusters and clients without exceeding the maximal load limit of each server cluster. In the present work, the Multiple Kernel Learning with Support Vector Machine (MKL-SVM) approach is proposed to quantify the disturbance in the utilization of multiple resources on a resource manager at client side and then verifying at the server side in the each cluster. Also, Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (FSAW) method is introduced for QoS provision for improving the system performance. The proposed model CMSdynMLB serves as the multiservice load balancing while considering the integer linear programming problem having unevenness measurement. In order to solve the problem of dynamic load balancing, Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HSPO) is proposed as it holds well for dynamic problems. From the simulation results, it is determined that proposed MKL-SVM algorithm can efficiently manage the dynamic multiservice load balancing. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Cloud-based multimedia system; Fuzzy simple additive weighting; Hybrid particle swarm optimization; Load balancing; Quality of service; Support vector machine","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Image retrieval; Integer programming; Managers; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Multiuser detection; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Problem solving; Resource allocation; Servers; Support vector machines; Telecommunication services; Cloud computing environments; Cloud-based; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization; Integer Linear Programming; Load balancing algorithms; Load balancing technique; Multiple Kernel Learning; Simple additive weighting; Quality of service","Eswaran, S.; Department of Computer Science, NGM CollegeIndia; email: sivaraman.eswaran@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",1383469X,,,,"English","Mobile Networks Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017121906

The erroneous vehicle position data taken from cellular network are processed in real time to compute edge level vehicle flow, space occupancy, and congestion with a mean error of less than 10%. For edge-level speed estimation, two models of ITS infrastructure deployment are proposed: the COngestion COverage MOdel (COCOMO) and the Edge COverage MOdel (ECOMO). The GPS Probes' speed data are used to extrapolate speed estimations from an infrastructure edge to the associated infrastructureless edge(s). The infrastructure requirement of COCOMO is constant, whereas that of ECOMO depends upon diversity in the congestion profile of edges. The COCOMO and ECOMO permit edge-level speed estimation with the 90 percentile error of 10%-22% and 10%-13%, respectively.

The storage nodes, which act as a middle tier between the sensors and the sink, could be compromised and allow attackers to learn sensitive data and manipulate query results. Prior schemes on secure query processing are weak, because they reveal non-negligible information, and therefore, attackers can statistically estimate the data values using domain knowledge and the history of query results. In this paper, we propose the first top- k query processing scheme that protects the privacy of sensor data and the integrity of query results. To preserve privacy, we build an index for each sensor collected data item using pseudo-random hash function and Bloom filters and transform top- k queries into top-range queries. To preserve integrity, we propose a data partition algorithm to partition each data item into an interval and attach the partition information with the data. The attached information ensures that the sink can verify the integrity of query results. We formally prove that our scheme is secure under IND-CKA security model. Our experimental results on real-life data show that our approach is accurate and practical for large network sizes. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","privacy preserving; top-k queries; Two-tiered sensor networks","Data handling; Digital storage; Hash functions; Information retrieval; Query processing; Sensor networks; Data partition; Domain knowledge; History of queries; Large networks; Real life data; Sensitive datas; Top-k query processing; Two-tiered sensor networks; Data privacy","Liu, A.X.; College of Computer Science and Network Security, Dongguan University of TechnologyChina; email: alexliuxy@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10636692,,IEANE,,"English","IEEE ACM Trans Networking",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018926585

It also ensures the integrity of stored cloud data, and processing of stored data in the various data centers. However, to provide better protection and management of sensitive information (data) are big challenge to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data in the cloud computation. Thus, there is an urgent need for storing and processing the data in the cloud environment without any information leakage. The sensitive data require the storing and processing mechanism and techniques to assurance the privacy preservation of individual user, to maintain the data integrity, and preserve confidentiality. Face recognition has recently achieved advancements in the unobtrusive recognition of individuals to maintain the privacy-preservation in the cloud computing. This paper emphasizes on cloud security and privacy issues and provides the solution using biometric face recognition. We propose a biometrics face recognition approach for security and privacy preservation of cloud users during their access to cloud resources. The proposed approach has three steps: (1) acquisition of face images (2) preprocessing and extraction of facial feature (3) recognition of individual using encrypted biometric feature.

It has been developed for privacy aware cross cloud service composition for processing big data applications. It can be effectively promotes cross cloud service composition in the situation where a cloud refuses to disclose all details of its service transaction records for business privacy issues in cross-cloud scenario. Our composition evaluation approach achieves two advantages. Firstly, our method significantly reduces the time complexity as only some representative history records are recruited, which is highly demanded for big data applications. Secondly, our method protects cloud privacy as a cloud is not required to process all of its transaction records, which accordingly protects privacy in big data. That to cross cloud is the most complex integration. With the help of two cloud servers and one big data database storage we are going to deploy data using an authenticated service. The authentication service is based deployed by assigning the primary key to each user. All this are processed with an RFID card. All the data is split and stored in a balanced way in two servers. So that the data are not clashed with each other and the time is reduced to store and process data. © 2016 IEEE.","Authenticated; Cross-cloud; RFID","Authentication; Data handling; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Quality of service; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Smart cards; Authenticated; Authentication services; Big data applications; Cloud service compositions; Complex integrations; Database storage; Evaluation approach; Transaction records; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052400,,,"English","Int.

If data set will be kept in main memory it will be very costly. A computer must retrieve required data and place it in internal memory to process it. Efficient data structures, like B-Tree, B+ tree, are used to process large datasets. Nodes of these data structures are buffered in memory using data structures like array, linked list and trees. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm which provide better results in case of disk based data structures which uses the concept of immediate modification i.e. when modification will be done in buffered structure (present in memory), an immediate modification will be done on disk. When the dataset size is large the CPU processing time is the crucial factor. Although, in case of disk based data structures the processing time is much less but if we try to reduce the processing time of CPU it will also gives beneficial results. Number of maximum disk accesses depends on height of B-Tree which is O(logblocksize/2n) [1], there is no change in the number of disk accesses. But the CPU processing time in case of search, insert, delete operation have been modified, reduced to O(log n) from O(n).

This would be much more powerful and general purpose when its ability is increased to solve general-purpose problems too, which can be solved easily on a conventional computer. As an example, DNA Computing falls short in mathematical computations, such as performing simple arithmetic as well as complex number arithmetic etc. In this work, the major purpose is to increase the power of DNA Computing to solve such general purpose problems.

Event-driven imaging, based on address-event-representation (AER) proposed earlier, ensures event-driven motion detection and conditional image acquisition. However it relies on delta modulation of pixel data upon event detection, which may lead to error accumulation for grey-scale reconstruction. In this work we propose event-driven on-sensor halftoning scheme based on cellular neural network (CNN), which can achieve compressed image acquisition, reducing the data to one bit per active pixel, while avoiding error accumulation over multiple frames. The proposed scheme can achieve reduction in power dissipation related to image quantization, communication and storage. Event-driven current-mode discrete-time CNN (DT-CNN) circuit is proposed for integration on CMOS imager pixel, which is optimally duty cycled to achieve ultra-low power for the halftoning operation. The impact of design parameters and process variations on the final image quality is assessed through inverse halftoning. Clubbed with event-driven acquisition, the proposed on-sensor halftoning can achieve large reduction in power dissipation and data volume, reduction in total volume, as compared to frame based imaging, as well as event driven grey-scale imaging. © 2017 IEEE.","analog; circuits; image processing; low power; neural networks","Cellular neural networks; Chemical detection; Data reduction; Digital storage; Electric losses; Image acquisition; Image quality; Low power electronics; Networks (circuits); Neural networks; Pixels; VLSI circuits; Address-event representation; analog; Design parameters; Error accumulation; Grey scale imaging; Image quantization; Inverse halftoning; Low Power; Image processing",,"Reis R.Stan M.Huebner M.Voros N.","IEEE Computer Society",21593469,9781509067626,,,"English","Proc.

Our approach considers a query workload and partitions data based on workload information. It distributes data by exploiting underlying structural relationship between properties using a property reachability matrix to optimize query performance. DWAHP gets rid of inter-node communication cost for frequent queries like linear and star queries and answers 83% of frequent query workload without inter-node communication. DWAHP is compared with state-of-theart solutions in terms of query execution time, query cost, storage space, and inter-node communication.

Many innovations are discovered in the field of OCR, but still many challengers are waiting for the solutions such as the recognition of document-backside-layered characters along with front side layer characters. The recognition of paper-backside-layered handwritten cum printed text is very difficult than the recognition of paper-frontside-layered characters. The fuzzy logic system process the data with help of bunch set of primary-based knowledge and delivers it into high successive recognition rate by using fuzzy classification functions, inference rules with decision-making procedures. Neural networks are compatible and best area to solve the pattern cum text recognition tasks, the learning based process start to implement from the basic imprecise data and algorithmic steps are formed with help of neuron-based learning process cum observations, but it is not effective to accomplish the user expected requirements for making the decisions. The successful combinational platform of neural fuzzy based closed loop system is proposing many technical ideas with effective solutions to solve the significant problems in OCR. This research methodology has proposed the mirror image reflection approach for recognition of document backside layer characters by using neural fuzzy hybrid system: it categorize the single page into the two sub layers, the first sub layer contains the paper front side text and the second sub layer contains paper back side text with corresponding pictures, characters, numerals and figures. Here the front sub layer text is completely bypassed with backside layer. The document-backside-layer input characters converted into neural-inputs, transformed it into fuzzy-sets, then fuzzy-rules applied based on the knowledge in fuzzification, related output responses are generated and the pre-cum-post-processing technique has applied to backside layer characters. Our ancestors used the palm leaves as the language-script-storage-Tool and enclosed valuable information about the astrology, geographical, engineering, architecture, scientific, astronomy and so on. This hidden invention provides the technical ideas and alternate salvation for engineering and medical challenges. But the major problem is extracting the information from it without open, turn the pages. Difficult to open bunched of palm leaves from a bundle due to running out of their natural life.

In the CC, the authentication as well as trust and reputation of the cloud users and service provider is a critical issue for the security of the cloud. Lots of articles previously present different trust models, but unfortunately, these trust models are not suitable for all cases as the trust is a non-measurable and subjective parameter that differs person to person. The trust involves many multi-dimensional factors such as evidence, reputation, expectations, feedback, history, risk, motivation, session behaviours, and so on. To addresses the above-mentioned issues, the paper present a novel multi-dimensional trust and reputation calculation model for the cloud computing, in which we integrate multiple trust factors that increase the novelty of the model. Additionally, we dynamically assign a weight for each trust and reputation factor using the Weighted Moving Average and Ordered Weighted Averaging (WMA-OWA) combination algorithm. The proposed model overcome the issues of the previous existing models. The detail presentation and analysis of the model shows that the model is appropriate and accurate for trust calculation in the cloud. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Multidimensional trust; Trust and reputation; WMA-OWA weight assignment algorithm","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Network function virtualization; Trusted computing; Cloud computing environments; Configurable computing; Internet based technology; Multi-dimensional trust; Ordered weighted averaging; Trust and reputation; Weight assignment algorithms; Weighted moving averages; Distributed computer systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059423,,,"English","ISEA Asia Secur.

Enormous storage of data and high-speed computing to customers over the internet can be accomplished using cloud. Security of data in cloud is one of the chief concerns which acts as an obstacle in the realization of cloud computing. Along with quick expansion and application of cloud computing, users concern more and more regarding security and privacy issues involved in these techniques. An efficient method to perform privacy preserving image filtering operations in encrypted domain over cloud is proposed in this paper. The proposed method provides facility for distributed secure processing and storage of the secret image using Shamir's secret sharing method and Chinese remainder theorem. The plain secret image is divided into number of shares in a manner that each share by itself does not reveal any meaningful information about the original image, while collectively, they retain all the information. Two secret keys are used to avail security of image shares and without knowledge of such keys, one cannot restore the secret image back. Hence, the proposed scheme is highly secured and the image can be processed without revealing any information at the cloud data center. Experimental results demonstrate that number of image filtering procedures for enhancement can be carried out efficiently in encrypted domain using the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud computing; encrypted domain processing; image enhancement; secret sharing","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Image enhancement; Network function virtualization; Security of data; Chinese remainder theorem; Cloud data centers; Domain processing; High speed computing; Original images; Privacy preserving; Secret sharing; Security and privacy issues; Image processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059423,,,"English","ISEA Asia Secur.

This is achieved by copying the data blocks to both main storage server and backup server simultaneously during the upload process. So that even if main storage server fails, the data needs of the user can be served by the backup server. Since the sensitive data as to be securely stored, instead of directly uploading the sensitive data file, the data file will be broken into data blocks and these blocks are encrypted and stored in the storage server. So that even if a intruder gains access to the storage server and tries to access the data, he will not be able to retrieve the data file as he cant determine which block belongs to which file and also the blocks are encrypted.

As the IoT network grows it tosses different challenges to engineers and researchers. As the network grows the size of the communicating and processed data also increases. In many cases the clients demands the history of data. To retain the past data large storage disks are in demand. Getting past data may help in data investigation to understand the system behaviour and to estimate its intelligence. Sometimes it is also very important in law-breaking investigation or in case of offence. Then going on adding the storage disks will not satisfy the user demands, buts it pops many other critical issues for both analysists and clients. The increase in disk size and quantity will increase the cost. It may also decrease the performance of the system. For small and individual personal systems this may become an obstacle. For an individual the patriotic IoT may become an expensive and lazy tool to maintain. This creates lots of problem in their daily life. This creates unwanted and unnecessary troubles in the routine life. The large data can be stored in cloud and can be retrieved from cloud data bases. But dynamic reading and storage is a biggest challenge for embedded systems used in IoT. Because of the network speed, data losses in wireless transport and port synchronization problem the data chunks may not arrive at port stand. This need to be intimated to user with acknowledgement signals. For storing real time data entity high speed data RAMs and internal storage devices are embedded in IoT modules. All operations in IoT system are monitored by a microcontroller contained motherboard. In simple and small IoT systems like personal or an individual systems single microcontroller instead of general purpose is sufficient. To reduce the burden on the microcontroller a co-processor can be used. In the present paper a method is proposed to access the data parameters without intervention of main processor. In this method a Direct Memory controller (DMA) is used to fetch the real parameters. © 2017 IEEE.","Data Fetch; DMA; Embedded System; IOT","Controllers; Electronic data interchange; Embedded systems; Integrated circuit design; Internet of things; Microcontrollers; Random access storage; Virtual storage; Acknowledgement signals; Data Fetch; Design and analysis; Individual systems; Iot architectures; Revolutionary changes; Synchronization problem; Wireless transport; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509059607,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Their recent evolution has been leveraging advantages such as high channel mobility and increased gate capacitance in short channel regime. The conventional MOSFETS suffer with exponential increase in leakage currents under down scaling whereas the CNTFETS overcome this limitation and deliver optimal voltage current characteristics. Considering the vast amount of data storage requirements in modern day systems, memories act as the vital blocks and they need to be thoroughly investigated with respect area, power and performance constraints before implementation. SRAM cell is one of the important building blocks in design of memories and a significant amount of attention is being paid into its functionality. The submicron scaling of conventional CMOS devices affect their performance due to short channel effects and circuits become unreliable. To overcome its challenges, in this work, MOSFET like ballistic CNTFETs have found to be the best alternatives for conventional CMOS devices under the 32 nm technology regime. The work focuses on the design and evaluation of the performance metrics of CNTFET based 6T SRAM cells at 32nm technology with observation on variation in chirality of the CNT.

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) performs well while storing and managing data sets of very large size. However, the performance of HDFS suffers while handling a large number of small files since they put a lot of burden on the NameNode of HDFS both in terms of memory and access time. To overcome these defects, we merge small files into a large file and store the merged file on HDFS. Generally, when small files are merged, variation in the size distribution of files is not taken into consideration. We propose a new algorithm OMSS (Optimized MapFile based Storage of Small files) which merges the small files into a large file based on the Worst fit strategy. The strategy helps in reducing internal fragmentation in data blocks, which in turn leads to fewer data blocks consumed for the same number of small files. Less number of data blocks mean fewer memory overheads at major nodes of Hadoop cluster and hence increased efficiency of data processing. Our experimental results indicate that the time to process data on HDFS containing unprocessed small files reduces significantly to 590s when MapFile is used and it reduces further to 440s when OMSS is used. OMSS as compared to MapFile merging algorithm has a reduction of 34.7% in memory requirements. © 2017 IEEE.","Hadoop; HDFS; MapFile; NameNode; OMSS; Small Files","Cluster computing; Data handling; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; File organization; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Hadoop; HDFS; MapFile; Namenode; OMSS; Small files; Grid computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509066100,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

So, the cloud storage contributors are in charge for monitoring the data which is available and accessible on the cloud, and the physical environment protected and running. There are still some interesting challenges on maintaining the truthfulness of full data that is stored up in the computing environment. The stored data in cloud is so important that the users make ensure either the data is corrupted or lost. This work studies the problem of ensuring the security and integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. This paper, proposes an approach named enhancing data storage security in cloud using Certificate less public auditing scheme which is used to generate key value. Key Generation Center (KGC) will generate only the partial key so that at any case it will not compromise user's private key. Private & public key is generated based on the partially generated private key by the KGC and to check the cloud data reliability of the user's uploads the data in server and then during the auditing of the reliability of data is checked. Once after checking it then sends the report to the users'. To confirm the data reliability during the auditing process & the server generates the proof and randomly selects the blocks.

From the region of interest (ROI) of an iris image, distinctive features are strategically extracted for template creation. The significant part, i.e., the ROI of an iris image, is encrypted in a transformational domain and the nonsignificant region is encrypted in a spatial domain. The advantage of this encryption scheme is increased key space and high degree of security compared to 1-D chaos-based systems. Apart from security, another advantage is reduced computational time compared to conventional encryption schemes implemented in either the spatial or frequency domain. The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of increased key space due to transform orders of the fractional wavelet transform (FrWT) and complex dynamical characteristics of hyperchaos, making the proposed scheme resistant to attacks. The properties of the FrWT and hyperchaos complement each other, making the system efficient and highly robust. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the computational time without compromising the security. Further security analysis is done for various attacks such as differential, statistical, and perceptual attacks, which give promising results and indicate that the proposed encryption scheme is efficient and robust. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","4-D Lorenz hyper-chaotic system; Arnold cat map; biometrics; fractional wavelet transform; hyper-chaos","Biometrics; Chaotic systems; Digital storage; Frequency domain analysis; Image segmentation; Network security; Wavelet transforms; Cat map; Computational time; Dynamical characteristics; Encryption schemes; Fractional wavelet transforms; Hyper-chaotic systems; Hyperchaos; The region of interest (ROI); Cryptography","Mehta, G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amity University, Sector-125, India; email: gmehta@amity.edu",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",19393555,,,,"English","Inf.

Ordinary image thresholding is a class of clustering technique used for image compression because of its simplicity, robustness and accuracy but it is computationally expensive when extending for multilevel image thresholding. An attempt is made in this paper to reduce the computational time of multilevel image thresholding using hybrid gravitational search algorithm and pattern search (hGSA-PS) by optimising a criterion such as Shannon entropy or Fuzzy entropy for seeking appropriate threshold values. From literature, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is designed to explore the global search space (exploitation), and pattern search (PS) is designed to exploit a local search space (exploration), so we hybridise the GSA and PS to achieve exploitation and exploration of search space by incorporating strengths and weakness of both, and results are compared with differential evolution, particle swarm optimisation and bat algorithm and proved better in standard deviation, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), weighted PSNR and reconstructed image quality.

The cloud system (server) has only access to the encrypted files of an authenticated end-user stored in it and can only do computation on these stored files according to the request of an end-user (client).

A model that incorporates area cost along with handling cost in optimizing warehouse design is developed and a solution algorithm is presented. The analytical model for vertical travel and the optimization model are applied to data from a real life case.

Mobile users usually store personal, official, and large amount of multimedia data. Security of such devices are mainly dependent on PIN (personal identification number), password, bio-metric data, or gestures/patterns. However, these mechanisms have a lot of security vulnerabilities and prone to various types of attacks such as shoulder surfing. The uniqueness of Electroencephalography (EEG) signal can be exploited to remove some of the drawbacks of the existing systems. Such signals can be recorded and transmitted through wireless medium for processing. In this paper, we propose a new framework to secure mobile devices using EEG signals along with existing pattern-based authentication. The pattern based authentication passwords are considered as identification tokens. We have investigated the use of EEG signals recorded during pattern drawing over the screen of the mobile device in the authentication phase. To accomplish this, we have collected EEG signals of 50 users while drawing different patterns. The robustness of the system has been evaluated against 2400 unauthorized attempts made by 30 unauthorized users who have tried to gain access of the device using known patterns of 20 genuine users. EEG signals are modeled using Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and using a binary classifier implemented with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to verify the authenticity of a test pattern. Verification performances are measured using three popular security matrices, namely Detection Error Trade-off (DET), Half Total Error Rate (HTER), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Our experiments revel that, the method is promising and can be a possible alternative to develop robust authentication protocols for hand-held devices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Authentication; EEG; HMM; Security; Security of mobile devices; SVM","Authentication; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Support vector machines; Binary classifiers; Identification token; Personal identification number; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Robust authentication protocols; Security; Security vulnerabilities; Unauthorized users; Mobile security","Kumar, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia",,"Academic Press",10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013746795

A small subset of machine learning algorithms, called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are considered as state-ofthe-A rt for many applications (e.g. video/audio classification). The main challenge in implementing the CNNs, in embedded systems, is their large computation, memory, and bandwidth requirements. To meet these demands, dedicated hardware accelerators have been proposed. Since memory is the major cost in CNNs, recent accelerators focus on reducing the memory accesses. In particular, they exploit data locality using either tiling, layer merging or intra/inter feature map parallelism to reduce the memory footprint. However, they lack the flexibility to interleave or cascade these optimizations. Moreover, most of the existing accelerators do not exploit compression that can simultaneously reduce memory requirements, increase the throughput, and enhance the energy efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we present a flexible accelerator called MOCHA. MOCHA has three features that differentiate it from the state-of-the-art: (i) the ability to compress input/kernels, (ii) the flexibility to interleave various optimizations, and (iii) intelligence to automatically interleave and cascade the optimizations, depending on the dimension of a specific CNN layer and available resources. Post layout Synthesis results reveal that MOCHA provides up to 63% higher energy efficiency, up to 42% higher throughput, and up to 30% less storage, compared to the next best accelerator, at the cost of 26-35% additional area. © 2017 IEEE.","Accelerators; Computer architecture; Convolutional Neural Networks; Reconfigurable computing","Acceleration; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Convolution; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Neural networks; Particle accelerators; Reconfigurable architectures; Bandwidth requirement; Convolutional neural network; Dedicated hardware; Layout synthesis; Memory footprint; Memory requirements; Reconfigurable computing; State of the art; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538639146,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

There is a wide range of applications which get benefited from such network. Unprocessed multimedia transmission is always expensive in terms of processing power, storage, and bandwidth. So, data processing is a challenge in WMSN. Exploring low-overhead data compression technique is a solution towards this problem. In this work we propose an energy saving image compression technique for WMSN using curve fitting technique considering the application of post-disaster situation analysis through image capturing of the affected area. Upon employing the method on the macroblocks of sensory image, curve fitting coefficients are generated and transmitted towards the sink thereby saves energy by transmitting reduced volume of data. Finally the design feasibility along with simulation results including statistical analysis is presented to evaluate efficacy of the scheme in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and peak signal to noise ratio. The comparative results confirm our scheme’s supremacy in WMSN application domain over existing methods. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Contiki OS; Curve fitting; Image compression; Routing; Wireless multimedia sensor network","Curve fitting; Data handling; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal to noise ratio; Video signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Contiki ossa; Data compression techniques; Image compression techniques; Multimedia transmissions; Peak signal to noise ratio; Routing; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN); Image compression","Banerjee, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Dr. B.C.

Advances in power electronic technologies such as Voltage Source Converter (VSC) improves the reliability and functionality of power electronic based controllers hence resulting in increased applications of STATCOM. In this paper, design and implementation of a Distribution type, Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based static synchronous compensator (D-STATCOM) has been carried out. It presents the enhancement of power quality problems, such as voltage sag and swell using Distribution Static Compensator (D-STATCOM) in distribution system. The model is based on Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. The control of the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) is done with the help of SPWM. The main focus of this paper is to compensate voltage sag and swell in a distribution system. To solve this problem custom power devices are used such as Fixed Compensators (FC, FR), Synchronous Condenser, SVC, SSSC, STATCOM etc. Among these devices Distribution STATCOM (D-STATCOM) is the most efficient and effective modern custom power device used in power distribution networks. D-STATCOM injects a current into the system to mitigate the voltage sag and swell. The work had been carried out in MATLAB environment using Simulink and SIM power system tool boxes.

It is possible to share data and to give authorized rights for decryption of any set of cipher text. Along with the encrypted data a searchable index is generated to provide search over the encrypted data. The data owner can share subset of files with other users by authorizing them an access rights and constant size of aggregate key. By doing this we are confidential about other outside files as those files cannot be decrypted using the given key. As per access rights search can be applied over restricted data set.

Owing to a fast and tensed life style, there is a drastic increase in the number and intensity of diseases which call for intense investigation. The digitization of large medical images like x-ray, Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) demands large disk storage space. Even with sufficient storage facilities, hospitals face difficulties with regard to storage of data. Numerous image compression methods have been developed to address the problem of storage space and to help the doctors in the analysis of patient's ailments more accurately and reliably. There are different lossless and lossy compression techniques. Joing Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) and Fractal Image Compression (FIC) are examples of lossy compression. FIC is gaining importance in the recent years. FIC is characterized by long encoding time and high Compression Ratio (CR). Further as medical images being voluminous, a high CR is required to reduce the storage space. Fractal Image compression adopts affine transforms to map the range blocks and domain blocks by using the property of self similarity in the images In view of this, the present paper aims in providing a comparative analysis of the different approaches for performing FIC applied on medical images (MR of brain, Mammograms(MG), ultrasound of uterus and CT of bone) to achieve high CR by still retaining the quality of the image. The results have shown a that FIC takes less encoding time when implemented on FPGA than using MATLAB. © 2016 IEEE.","FPGA; Fractal Theory; Iterated Function systems; PSNR; Quad-tree; Range blocks","Affine transforms; Computerized tomography; Digital storage; Encoding (symbols); Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Fractals; Image analysis; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic storage; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Quality control; Fractal theory; Iterated function system; PSNR; Quad trees; Range block; Image compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046973,,,"English","Int.

In most rural parts of India most of the people are unable to follow the doctor's prescription, which causes over dosage or wrong dosage due to misunderstanding of doctor's direction. It may cause negative consequences for patients. Sometimes it results to severe impact on their health. This paper presents the design and implementation of 'eMedicare' for those who take medications without continuous professional supervision. Electronic dispensing systems are eHealth drug storage devices that electronically dispense medications in a programmed fashion and track medication use. eMedicare acts as watchdog for medication usage. eMedicare can track the missed medications doses. It notifies the patients through beating an alarm, or through a phone call or updating data on the server. Live data is updated in the server for each dose at the scheduled time with help of Internet of Things (IoT)[3]. Sometimes even after the alarm, if the patients did not take any medicines then it will alert the care takers/ nursing staff through sending messages to server or making phone calls.

The explosion of DNA data has given a challenge for understanding genomic structure, the disk storage and computation. It is essential for the development of efficient compression techniques to handle genomic data storage. Data compression is used to store the data in less memory. The properties of DNA sequence offer a chance to build DNA specific compression algorithms. In this paper, a novel compression technique is proposed for genomic data. In the first stage, each base in DNA sequence is converted into binary form using 2-bit encoding system. On the resultant binary string, A Modified run length encoding is applied. The output is compressed again using Huffman encoding technique in second stage. The encoded sequence is converted into ASCII characters. This technique is quite simple and effective. © 2016 IEEE.","Compression; DNA sequence; Huffman coding; Run length encoding","Bins; Bioinformatics; Character sets; Digital storage; DNA; DNA sequences; Embedded systems; Encoding (symbols); Genes; Signal processing; Compression algorithms; Compression techniques; Encoded sequences; Genomic structure; Huffman coding; Huffman encoding; Run-length encoding; Sequence compaction; Compaction",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509046201,,,"English","Int.

For the benefit of user, an improved security model for the data stored on the cloud is provided by encrypting the data even before uploading the file to the storage server. On the other side, the capacity of the cloud storage is optimally utilized by avoiding redundant storage of the same file on the server. Encrypting the same file by using two different algorithms produces two different encrypted files which in turn affects the performance by the de-duplication concept of the service provider. So an efficient mechanism which generates the hash value of the text and uses this hash value towards encrypting the data is proposed which uses hash values with unique file identifier. While the client uploads file to the cloud database, the unique id of the file is compared with those stored into the server. The proposed algorithm called Temporal Data De-duplication Algorithm (TDDdA) is used to get better performance of data storage in cloud. Since our approach is based on time, the read and write response time of the cloud data is linearly reduced. Increased security is achievable through our proposed model. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Cloud Database; Data De-duplication; Data Storage; Temporal Data","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Database systems; Cloud database; Data de duplications; Data storage; Data storage models; De duplications; Service provider; Storage servers; Temporal Data; Digital storage","Muthurajkumar, S.; Department of Information Science and Technology, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna UniversityIndia; email: muthurajkumarss@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509058884,,,"English","Int.

It enables the individuals, clients or the enterprises to outsource their data and application software to the cloud server. The services are offered by a cloud service provider (CSP) and the users need to pay for what they use. There are many security concerns needs to be addressed when the data is maintained by third party service provider in cloud. The auditor is introduced to audit the integrity of the data on behalf of the client in order to ensure integrity of data. This can be called as public auditability of data. Recently, two privacy preserving auditing mechanisms named Oruta and Knox are introduced to check the correctness of stored data. In this paper, we try to propose the security flaw of their scheme when active adversaries are involved in cloud storage. An active adversary is capable of modifying the data stored in cloud arbitrarily. This data modification is not being identified by the user and the auditor in the verification process. We try to suggest a solution to resolve this flaw by signing the proof response generated on the cloud server side. Then the signed proof is sent to the trusted third party auditor (TTPA) for verification. The auditor first verifies the signature and for the validation of the proof. The proposed scheme is proved to be secure against active adversary. © 2017 IEEE.","Auditing; cloud storage; data; integrity; privacy preserving; Security; TTPA","Application programs; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Internet service providers; Network security; Security of data; Auditing; Cloud storages; data; integrity; Privacy preserving; Security; TTPA; Data privacy",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509058884,,,"English","Int.

Insecure internet as an underlying communication medium results in unlock of cryptographic attacks both from outsider (via Internet) and insider (via cloud system) on user and enterprise specific data. To combat these issues, we present a privacy preserving, hybrid profile authentication scheme exploiting Big Data features for a ubiquitous user connecting to cloud server through a smart device. Our system adopts the strengths of fuzzy hashing and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to authenticate and secure the critical user data stored in cloud servers from insiders and third party. We use user specific information like user password and behavioral features like key stroke dynamics to generate a user profile. Based on authors knowledge, our system i.e. PPMUAS is the first of its kind of system which considers multi factors and hybrid profile for privacy preserving and remote user authentication. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach through public data sets. Our result shows that our proposed scheme can successfully validate legitimate users while detecting imposters. © 2016 IEEE.","Big Data; Cloud Authentication; Fully Homomorphic Encryption; Fuzzy Hashing; Privacy-Preserving Authentication","Behavioral research; Big data; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Authentication scheme; Cloud authentications; Communication technologies; Fully homomorphic encryption; Fuzzy Hashing; Privacy-preserving authentication; Remote user authentication; Specific information; Authentication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509021932,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Ergo, each system and process in Body Sensor Network (BSN) which accesses this data needs to be secured well enough. In order to achieve this high security along with low energy consumption, a key management scheme named as Double Encryption has been proposed here. The proposed method uses two keys for encryption: a novel physiological feature based key and a pre-shared key between the communicating nodes. The feature and key generation, both are more economical than the existing algorithms in terms of computation, communication, storage, security and error. The features are exchanged with the help of simple addition and subtraction, instead of heavy computations like a vault or coffer creation, commitment, encryption or decryption. The another salient feature of the proposed algorithm is that if the key negotiation fails once, the protocol does not need to be restarted. The protocol is secure in various scenarios like Brute Force Attack, RCB (Remotely Capturing Biometric data) attack, Node Capture attack and Battery Depletion Attack. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cryptography; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Public key cryptography; Body sensor networks (BSN); Brute-force attack; Key management schemes; Low energy consumption; Node capture attack; Physiological features; Salient features; Sensitive datas; Body sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042500,,,"English","Int.

Recently, the most intellectual decision is to retrieve the requested data from the enormous flooded data storage through the service based cloud architecture by any type of cloud users through the remarkably efficient way using the methodologies like DBaaS, multi-tenancy, database integration. Among them, multi-tenancy and database integration can be applicable in the SaaS service model through the tightly coupled nature of service composition. But, this static service composition suffers from implementation complexity, cost factor, flexibility and scalability for further database adaptability and efficient data availability. Here, the proposed Dynamic Service Composition (abbreviated as DSC) methodology is sophisticated enough to retrieve different types of data from the multiple heterogeneous cloud databases after connectivity setup with new databases at runtime and on-demand basis. This dynamic database connectivity through the loosely coupled service composition is able to supply the requested data within a revolutionary computational speed. This methodology is able to overcome the challenges introduced by static service composition. DSC can govern multiple cloud databases through the flexible services connectivity without any information about their position in the cloud. This concept can be termed as database virtualization. Overall, the proposed DSC mechanism can monitor heterogeneous cloud databases and is responsible for significant growth over computational power for efficient data availability within a remarkable lower cost in a flexible and scalable way. © 2017 IEEE.","Choreography Based Integration; Database Integration; Database Virtualization; Dynamic Service Composition; Multi-tenancy; Orchestration Based Integration","Closed loop control systems; Cloud computing; Database systems; Digital storage; Information management; Integration; Quality of service; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Computational power; Computational speed; Database integration; Database virtualization; Dynamic service composition; Implementation complexity; Multi tenancies; Service compositions; Software as a service (SaaS)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035182,,,"English","Proc.

Very huge amount of data is stored at cloud storage servers by various users or organizations. With such services, various key issues are arises such as data security, confidentiality. To overcome these, the key concept was introduced such as Cryptography. In cryptography, various keys are used to encrypt or decrypt the data before uploading or downloading from cloud server. To generate the private and public key pair, distributed key generation (DKG) protocol was introduced. But within organization there is another issue is arises, regarding to authority based data access control policy. That is only user with particular authority can access data stored at cloud, based on their authority level. For this hierarchical threshold access structure (HTAS) is used along with DKG, known as HTDKG. In this, various users are divided into levels based on their designation and some threshold is assigned. At the time of data access, only specific levels users can access the specific amount of data. Because of this, all data is not revealed to any unconcern user. In existing system, HTDKG key generation and management is perform at user side which increases the management overhead. To overcome this issue, we introduced the third party Key Distribution Center (KDC), which execute the HTDKG protocol and take responsibility of all key generation, distribution and management activities. Experimental results prove that the proposed system decrease the processing time and enhances the memory utilization by utilizing of KDC. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Cloud data storage; Data access control policy; Hierarchical threshold access structure; Key distribution center","Access control; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Distributed database systems; Warehouses; Cloud data; Data access control; Distributed key generation protocols; Key distribution centers; Key generation and managements; Management activities; Private and public key pairs; Threshold access structures; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036622,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The task that challenges almost every progressing implementation is security and privacy. In earlier days, corporate /IT sectors were facing more security challenges over the data. Especially in a centralized environment, unauthorized users can easily modify the data without the knowledge of the owner, i.e., security breach is unavoidable. So, it becomes mandatory to secure the data. The proposed model follows the decentralized architecture which does not depend on any third party system. In this model, the data security can be enhanced by using cyclic shift transposition algorithm.

It is a challenging issue for both military and recovery teams to re-stabilize the situation in a non-communication environment due to infrastructure loss. Re-stabilizing the system will be slow and expensive, so in such cases short range, mobile devices can be very useful to construct a multihop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) for quick connectivity to reach the sufferers. But this emergency communication system drives an uncertainty to the network stability due to its power resource constraints. From the route discovery analysis, we observed that 5-10% of the power loss occurs during route discovery operation itself by each node to perform the broadcasting, receiving and replying tasks. In totality, it costs a huge power loss in case of the large scalable network. Wetar get this problem and propose a Power Saving Mechanism (PSM) for route discovery through reducing the number of rebroadcasting nodes during route discovery process. The proposal will improve the network lifetime and throughput through reducing the power consumption. An evaluation result of scalability and mobility variation shows the proposal efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.","Broadcasting; MANET; Network Stability; Power saving; Route Discovery","Broadcasting; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Communication environments; Emergency communication; MANET; Multihop mobile ad hoc networks; Network stability; Power savings; Route discovery; Route discovery process; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035182,,,"English","Proc.

The sensor nodes are generally tiny and made of irreplaceable power source and limited capacity for computing, communication, and storage. The power constraint necessitates that the WSN routing protocols conserve energy as critical factor to maximize the network lifetime. Cluster-based approaches are popularly used for its energy efficiency where some nodes designated as Cluster Heads (CHs) organize WSNs for data aggregation and energy saving. The CH is responsible for gathering data from the cluster nodes and conveying it to the base station due to which higher energy drain occurs at CH leading to uneven network degradation. Thus, the selection of CH is critical for improving the WSN performance and lifetime.

In this paper, a rapid 2-D lossy compression technique constructed using wavelet-based contourlet transform (WBCT) and binary array technique (BAT) has been proposed for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. In WBCT, the high-frequency subband obtained from wavelet transform is further decomposed into multiple directional subbands by directional filter bank to obtain more directional information. The relationship between the coefficients has been changed in WBCT as it has more directions. The differences in parent–child relationships are handled by a repositioning algorithm. The repositioned coefficients are then subjected to quantization. The quantized coefficients are further compressed by BAT where the most frequently occurring value is coded only once. The proposed method has been experimented with real-time CT and MRI images, the results indicated that the processing time of the proposed method is less compared to existing wavelet-based set-partitioning in hierarchical trees and set-partitioning embedded block coders. The evaluation results obtained from radiologists indicated that the proposed method could reproduce the diagnostic features of CT and MRI images precisely. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Compression; Computed tomography (CT); Digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Picture archiving and communication system (PACS); Wavelet-based contourlet transform (WBCT)","Bins; Compaction; Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Image compression; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Picture archiving and communication systems; Tomography; Wavelet transforms; Compression techniques; Directional filter banks; Directional information; MRI image compression; Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS); Quantized coefficients; Set partitioning in hierarchical tree; Wavelet-based contourlet transforms; Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)","Uma Vetri Selvi, G.; Department of Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences, PSG College of TechnologyIndia; email: umavetriselvi_gt@yahoo.co.in",,"Springer Verlag",18618200,,,,"English","J.

The virtual machine placement algorithm evaluates the performance data for the host, settings of hardware, resource requirements, and host ratings to provide the best placement on host. Generally, the service providers cannot manage or control the cloud infrastructure including operating system, servers, storage and the placement of service components. This lack of consequence is a deterrent to cloud adoption for some customers. This paper presents an approach for customers to handle the integrated virtual machine workloads. The fuzzy decision making approach, integer linear programming and cost factors such as strategic decision, selection of cloud computing services and its types are considered in this paper. The fuzzy quantifiers are used for selecting the number of virtual machines in the environment and it optimizes the demand of the cloud resources in distributed environment. Integer linear programming constraints have been used to enable infrastructure providers to optimize the placement of virtual machines and algorithms to provide service provider effect.

In cloud area network, security is the main challenge faced by cloud providers and their customers. The advantage of cloud computing includes reduced cost, re-provisioning of resources etc. The cloud network makes use of standard encryption method to secure documents while storing in online. In this paper, we have depicted two efficient encryption algorithms that meet security demand in cloud. Probabilistic encryption, one of these algorithms may be used to produce randomness of text encryption. With this algorithm, if the same message is encrypted twice it should yield different secret coded texts on both calculations. Another crucial algorithm is homomorphic encryption, is a cryptographic method to define the sample system and to provide a software implementation. In order to maintain quality of service (QoS) and improve customer satisfaction, we are going to propose an efficient algorithm which combines the characteristics of both probabilistic and homomorphic encryption techniques, to provide high level of security.

In MCC, mobile users access the cloud services with the mobile device. Generally, the users of mobile cloud can select their services from the broker using an agent. There is an agreement between the users and service provider called SLA. Data are of varying types and they require different security levels based on their requirement. Classification of Mobile user’s data is a time-consuming process. A superior naive classifier for secure data classification in agent based mobile cloud computing is proposed in this paper. The agent classifies the user’s data into three different groups namely, low, medium, high. Then, the data are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standards (AES). Encrypted data is transferred to the broker for selecting for suitable service agent.But the broker has many to one relationship with service agents. Then the data is sent to the cloud service provider for storage. The stored data is then homomorphically encrypted which enables the cloud provider and cloud user to process the data without the need for decryption. Performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed method reduces classification time and provides better security and integrity on mobile cloud data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Advanced encryption standards; Homomorphic encryption; Mobile cloud computing; Superior naive classifier; Ubiquitous computing","Big data; Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Embedded systems; Mobile devices; Ubiquitous computing; Advanced Encryption Standard; Classification time; Cloud service providers; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Mobile users access; Naive classifiers; Performance analysis; Service provider; Mobile cloud computing","Arvind, K.S.; Anna UniversityIndia; email: erodearvind@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014245407

The limited size of these buffers results in their frequent overflowing. In scenarios when such overflowing is not desirable, the chip is stalled, and the state data recorded in these buffers are transferred off-chip. Such frequent stalling significantly impedes efficient debugging. We propose a novel scheme to minimize the number of such stalls using a portion of the trace buffer to also store summaries of trace messages. We describe an overlapped trace buffer architecture that uses a reduced number of ports to capture tapered summaries where both detailed and summary versions of traces are stored simultaneously. We propose a simple hardware structure to generate two kinds of trace summaries-spatial and temporal-as specified by the validation engineer. We introduce a storage specification language that allows the validation engineer to unambiguously specify the information to be captured in these summaries to the debug hardware.

The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively.

But it also raises concern ondata privacy. To overcome the privacy issue, data is stored in anencrypted format. However encryption makes search over theprotected data convoluted. The need of the hour is to provide anefficient method for data storage and search over protected dataat remote provider without compromising with security. Inkeyword based search, each data item is associated with a set ofkeywords over which the search is performed. For a search, usersupplies keywords to the owner to get a corresponding trapdoor tobe searched over the provider. But the trapdoor is vulnerable toonline/ offline keyword guessing attack.

This paper is concerned with finding universal lossless compressed representations of deep feedforward networkswith synaptic weights drawn from discrete sets. The basic insight that allows much less rate than naive approaches is the recognition that the bipartite graph layers of feedforward networks have a kind of permutation invariance to the labeling of nodes, in terms of inferential operation.

It is known for its non-contact and non-ionizing nature and often used in almost every field. With this fact, it attracts the clinicians to use it for screening the various abnormal conditions related to superficial organs of the human body; where it is effectively opted to use alone or in conjunction with other medical imaging modalities. The sharing of patient data is frequent in medical environment, so in case of thermography. This paper gives a brief idea about ongoing clinical applications of infrared thermography and need of standardized thermogram format. This paper focuses on the quantitative approach for storage and retrieval of thermal data in DICOM format. In contrast to false colored thermograms, the proposed file format occupies less storage space and bandwidth. It is concluded that the proposed methodology provides a file format which is easy to handle at both sending and receiving end. These beneficial outcomes encourage its use in clinical environments for sharing and handling of thermographic information. © 2016 IEEE.","DICOM; false colored thermograms; IR thermography; medical thermogram format; quantitative archival and retrieval","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Hospital data processing; Medical imaging; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (temperature measurement); DICOM; false colored thermograms; IR thermography; medical thermogram format; quantitative archival and retrieval; Thermography (imaging)",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Apache Spark is another emerging in-memory framework for large-scale, faster data processing. Such system requires a lot of system resources like memory, CPU and storage depending on the data size. In this paper we empirically present comparative approach between Apache Hadoop and related tools (Apache Spark) for processing (performing a search operation on different datasets.) large amount of data. Consequently, various performance behaviors like CPU utilization, memory, RSS and VSZ were recorded along with time to execute the job on test cluster environment.

We trust our privacy and security to Network Video Recording (NVR) devices, which is programmed to overwrite all the way from start once finished up. There are chances that really important video data can be get deleted on the run while the less important still stays somewhere on the storage drive. The continuous push of multiple streams of video data to the network also chokes the surveillance network, and makes for administrators nightmare. We propose a policy-driven infrastructure to overcome these issues of storage and network, built on commodity hardware. Our system breaks the large video chunk generated by streaming devices to small and manageable chunks, before pushing to the network, labeled with a priority mark. This make it easy for an administrator to force a specific policy decision on it, which can be marking it for speedy deletion or safe storage. This also opens the possibility of edge computing with a selective push to the core network, based on the network availability and priority of the data. Low power single board devices such as Raspberry Pi replace the traditional NVR devices in the system, saving on cost and energy. The project develops a manageable and economically viable video surveillance system for moderate to large scale institutions, where streamed data can have varying importance or precedence. We expect better utilization of network bandwidth, safer and selective storage of sensitive data, and a major cut in setup costs from our research and findings. © 2016 IEEE.","edge computing; IOT; log abstractions; policy based storage; video surveillance","Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Monitoring; Video recording; Edge computing; log abstractions; Network availability; Policy-based; Privacy and security; Surveillance networks; Video surveillance; Video surveillance systems; Security systems",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

However, WSN require powerful techniques for handling data transmission and processing. Sensor nodes in WSN have a limited communication range, and their storage and processing capabilities as well as their power resources are also limited. The state-of-The-Art routing protocols in WSNs are classified with the two major divisions viz., network structure and protocol operations. This paper provides cursory look on network structure routing protocols classifications and its characteristics.

In this paper, a novel methodology is described for efficiently reconstructing executables from memory dumps acquired from ×86 and ×64 Windows 7 systems. This reconstruction process is challenging because different sections of the executables reside in different memory pages and thus in different locations in the acquired memory dump file.

Cloud computing virtualizes system by pooling and sharing resources. Customers store their data on the cloud using resources and they provide the access of data to the users. Cloud computing has to ensure the security of the data stored in the cloud. Access to the data stored in the cloud is provided through access controls defined by data owner while storing the data in the cloud. Access control models using access controls specified by the data owner will monitor access to the data on the cloud. Earlier various traditional access control models are proposed and they are not sufficient for the cloud environment. Cloud environment supports remote access for computation, storage etc. Cloud computing demands attribute based encryption-Access control models. Various access control models are proposed using attribute encryption namely KP-ABE, CP-ABE, HASBE. These access control models are static in nature. In this paper, we propose a dynamic attribute-based risk aware access control model which can be hybridized with the above access control models. Our model combines risk computation with attributes used for access control.

Outsourcing the data to cloud storage servers ease the client accountability by facilitating stumpy cost, secure, locality independent platforms and scalable resources. With the proliferation of cloud technologies, outsourced data is scrolling among the nodes, client unaware of storage location and no longer have possession of data. Data privacy and integrity are formidable concerns for data owners. So, verification of data integrity is vital. Thus, an efficient auditing scheme is required to guarantee data possessor so as to assure them data safety and accuracy. In this paper, we propose zero knowledge proof interactive system for data integrity verification on cloud. Our method strengthened by using Homomorphic encryption tags, generated on encrypted data with zero knowledge to the interactive members. We consider TPA (Third Party Auditor) as audit agent inside the cloud on behalf of client to reduce the communication cost. The scheme drastically reduces input and output costs by generating the probabilistic proof of possession using sampling sets of data blocks from the server. Client maintains meta data of file for verification, which reduces huge communication cost on network. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show the efficiency of the scheme for integrity proofs. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Storage; Data Integrity; Homomorphic Encryption; TPA; Verification Tags","Artificial intelligence; Cost reduction; Costs; Cryptography; Data privacy; Cloud storages; Cloud technologies; Communication cost; Data integrity; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Information technology application; Interactive system; Zero knowledge proof; Digital storage",,"Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006113,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The documents stored in cloud are of huge size and due to its sensitivity arises security and storage problems. Data is stored on remote location in cloud and cryptographic techniques resolve problems of data security. To ensure data to be secure in cloud, the client encrypts data and then stores on cloud by employing Hyper Elliptic Curve cryptography (HECC). Search over encrypted data makes the process of file retrieval from cloud more difficult. The paper proposes architecture of multiple keyword search by building index using Bloom filter and also pair key generation by false random bit generator. Bloom filter takes constant time for searching O (N) on large encrypted file systems without the need of document decryption thereby speeding up the process of ciphertext retrieval on user side. Bit array representing keyword information is only stored by data owner on cloud where the server is unable to find file content or query information. The experimental results show that Bloom filter based indexing is faster than traditional indexing schemes, the multiple keyword based search algorithm is effective in case of the response time of query and scalability of the system in case of size of data.","Bloom filter; False random bit generation; HECC; Secure index","Bandpass filters; Cryptography; Data structures; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Indexing (of information); Number theory; Public key cryptography; Bloom filters; Cryptographic techniques; Encrypted File System; HECC; Hyper-elliptic curves; Random bit generations; Random bit generators; Secure index; Search engines","Thiyagarajan, D.; School of Computing Science and Engineering, VIT University, Chennai Campus, Vandalur - Kelambakkam Road, India; email: devi.t2013@vit.ac.in",,"Femto Technique Co., Ltd.",1816353X,,,,"English","Int.

It has been recently established that joint design of content delivery and storage (coded caching) can significantly improve performance over conventional caching. Coded caching is well suited to emerging heterogeneous wireless architectures which consist of a dense deployment of local-coverage wireless access points (APs) with high data rates, along with sparsely-distributed, large-coverage macro-cell base stations (BS). This enables design of coded caching-and-delivery schemes that equip APs with storage, and place content in them in a way that creates coded-multicast opportunities for combining with macro-cell broadcast to satisfy users even with different demands. Such coded-caching schemes have been shown to be order-optimal with respect to the BS transmission rate, for a system with single-level content, i.e., one where all content is uniformly popular. In this paper, we consider a system with non-uniform popularity content which is divided into multiple levels, based on varying degrees of popularity. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of an order-optimal scheme which judiciously shares cache memory among files with different popularities. To show order-optimality we derive new information-theoretic lower bounds, which use a sliding-window entropy inequality, effectively creating a non-cut-set bound. We also extend the ideas to when users can access multiple caches along with the broadcast. Finally, we consider two extreme cases of user distribution across caches for the multi-level popularity model: A single user per cache (single-user setup) versus a large number of users per cache (multi-user setup), and demonstrate a dichotomy in the order-optimal strategies for these two extreme cases. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","cache memory; Content distribution networks; network coding","Buffer storage; Digital storage; Information theory; Network coding; Content distribution networks; Entropy inequality; Improve performance; Information-theoretic lower bounds; Optimal strategies; Transmission rates; Wireless access points; Wireless architectures; Cache memory","Hachem, J.; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los AngelesUnited States",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189448,,IETTA,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. It is a simple key-based object store where each Amazon S3 object has data, a key, and metadata. Object key name identifies the object in a bucket uniquely. Object metadata is a set of name-value pairs that can be set at the time of uploading. This design enables S3 to provide excellent performance for storing and retrieving objects based on a known key. However there are certain challenges which limits the use of the Object metadata efficiently due to non-standard metadata keys. On the other hand, ontology has been used to represent information in various domains. The use of ontology to model the information coming from heterogeneous sources results in non-ambiguous and a standard representation. Additionally, with an ontology based metadata the underlying metadata keys have the same shared semantic meaning. Thus ontology representation of S3 objects makes searching of objects using required attributes faster and efficient.

This growing dependency has triggered extensive storage of data and development of 'high availability' databases. One of the prevalent practices in the industry is to provide for a data center (DC) where the on-going service runs under normal circumstances and another server at Disaster Recovery Center (DR) that contains a replica of the database to provide continuity of service if the primary database fails due to a catastrophe or some other unavoidable reasons. Such situation may cause the database server to be damaged or result in a hardware malfunction. In this paper, we propose a decentralized disaster recovery structure instead of a single centralized DR, i.e. the databases are hosted on multiple servers, where each of these servers is catering to one or more related schema. Since we have multiple servers each catering for a different schema, we also propose different replication schemes for each of these schemas depending on the nature of updates and usage. In the proposed architecture, we would like to have a cyclic back up scheme to provide better decentralization and less vulnerable as opposed to a radial back up architectures. © 2017 IEEE.","CPU idleness; Data centre; Decentralized system; Disaster Recovery Centre; Query Forwarding","Architecture; Database systems; Digital storage; Disasters; Query processing; Recovery; Continuity of services; Data centres; Decentralized system; Disaster recovery; Disaster recovery centers; Managerial decision; Proposed architectures; Query forwarding; Search engines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509053209,85RSA,,"English","Proc IEEE Int Conf Ind Technol",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019603833

Cryptography has emerged as a significant solution which portrays a vivacious role in securing the information against several attacks. Advanced Encryption Standard block cipher (Known as AES) is an extensively studied and widely used cryptographic block cipher system to secure data and information. The strength of AES algorithm is determined by the choice of S-Box along with other aspects. This paper proposes a new technique to generate S-Box dynamically which will intensify the complexity of S-Box construction to encounter any possible attack on the fixed S-Box. Predefined static S-Boxes pose a weak point for the attackers to analyze certain cipher text pairs. The new S-boxes created are additionally dynamic, random and key dependent which attempts to escalate the complexity of the algorithm and furthermore mark the cryptanalysis more challenging. This paper discusses the importance of substitution S-boxes, their role in ensuring the strength of a cipher system and finally describes a new approach of generating dynamic S-box which is constructed centered on round key. © 2016 IEEE.","AES; Block Cipher; Cryptanalysis; Key-dependent S-box; Round key","Computational complexity; Data privacy; Digital storage; Security of data; Standards; Advanced Encryption Standard; AES block cipher; Block ciphers; Box construction; Cryptanalysis; Information safety; Key-dependent S-box; Round key; Cryptography",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

The responsibility of protecting that data is given to cloud storage provider. Meanwhile, it is prime concern of data owner to verify if the data is in the right form in the cloud, it is extremely burdensome if data owner carries out the audit of outsourced data and repairs the corrupted data and authenticators by himself. In earlier schemes, fully trusted third party auditor (TPA) carries out the verification process. But trusting TPA fully isn't the right idea. So, we introduce semi trusted TPA for verification where, in case it generates biased(wrong) results with respect to data stored on cloud, data owner will be intimated by proxy about it, so that data owner can inform cloud service provider. To carry out the repair of corrupted blocks of data and authenticators, we use proxy, which is also semi trusted and has the privilege to regenerate authenticators. All this is automated and done in the absence of data owner. Since the sole idea of this scheme is to relieve the data owner off the additional responsibility of data verification and repair, this technique is a big help to data owner. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Storage; Proxy; Public Audit; Regenerating Code","Repair; Trusted computing; Cloud environments; Cloud service providers; Cloud storages; Proxy; Public Audit; Regenerating codes; Trusted third parties; Verification process; Digital storage",,"Niranjan S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509023981,,,"English","Proc.

It has an increased bandwidth and power save states that are enhanced with efficient bus utilization through asynchronous signaling. It defines transfer modes such as bulk, isochronous, interrupt and control along with a new bulk streaming protocol. Thus, it finds various applications in mass storage, streaming of voice/video data, etc. Specifically in bulk transfer mode, the performance of transfer is taken into account with respect to the speed of transmission of data packets.

Digital crimes have become a big problem due to large number of data access, insufficient threat analysis techniques and growing size of storage capacity for investigating agencies. Since threat detection projects involve processing of large volume of uncertain information and to reduce uncertainties in the detection process, the analyst has to evaluate a large volume of data collected from different sources and network threat related databases. Being a data intensive analysis and detection, for improved analysis and detection, there is a need for these data to be harmonized and integrated along with the visualization technique for displaying large amount of data at once by incorporating information from various sources and variety of threat detection criteria's (e.g., threat types, attacker behavior and motive, effects of the threat on resources). Data Fusion and Integrated visualization of data distribution bars and rules, visualization of behavior and comprehensive analysis, maps allow investigating agencies to analyze different rules and data at different level, with any kind of anomaly. The primary aim of this study deals with have a front end or upstream approach towards an effective dynamic data fusion (DF)-based analysis and detection procedures along with visualization technique for network forensic investigation and threat analysis. Thus such procedures would be able to detect different network trends and patterns and integrate various intrusion datasets from different sources. As a practical approach, the model has been implemented in identification, analysis and detection for IP Spoofing as an illustrative example.

Cloud computing provides cornucopian of gratuities for both individual users and business organizations. ‘Cloud’ is more of a notion where files and data are hosted online and can be accessed when required via a number of methods, anywhere, and at any time. That is the gist of it. Providing storage space to cloud users is an appealing service of cloud computing. Although cloud storage provides benefits of location independence access to data, reduced burden for hardware and software maintenance and many more, yet this service has several challenges in the range of security and preserving data. Cloud servers may exist in white puffy shapes in the azure, but these are not immune to temporal errors. To ensure that outsourced data is secure and is not tampered, cloud provider must allow data proprietor to periodically audit data integrity. Numerous Remote Data Auditing (RDA) protocols have been proposed by researchers so far. In presented work, to cope with this problem we analyze the efficiency issues of a current protocol for data integrity auditing in cloud storage and propose an approach based on Relative Index and Time Stamped Merkle Hash Tree (RITS−−MHT) which integrates MHT with relative index of a node resulting in reduction of computation cost of searching a data block from O(n) in Wang's protocol to O(log n) and time of last modification to data, thereby guarantying freshness of data respectively. RITS−−MHT ensures that the outsourced data has not been polluted as well as it assures that the recent copy of data is reclaimed. This protocol supports public auditing of data, and efficiently supports data dynamic operations like insertion, modification, deletion of outsourced data at minimal computational cost. The security of proposed protocol has been proved in Random Oracle Model (ROM). As compared to Wang's protocol, RITS−−MHT is more efficient in terms of computation cost. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud computing; Data integrity audit; Proof of possession; Third party audit","Cloud computing; Costs; Data structures; Printing machinery; Trees (mathematics); Business organizations; Computational costs; Data integrity; Hardware and software; Location independence; Proof of possession; Random Oracle model; Third parties; Digital storage","Garg, N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: neenu.garg@thapar.edu",,"Academic Press",10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013150857

The modular scheme allows for the complete use of the available set of features and capabilities of the DSC. Further, the system is equipped with extensive debug capabilities that facilitate the monitoring of various system parameters. The system is low cost, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing hardware such as inverters and sensors. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Education; Nonlinear control systems; Power electronics; Digital signal controllers; Drive systems; Modularized; Motor control; Motor control system; Operational limits; Power electronic drive; Texas Instruments; Program debugging",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467389228,,,"English","Proc. -Texas Instruments India Educ.'

Odometry is a natural technique for deciding the relative localization of mobile robots. It includes the identification of an arrangement of kinematic parameters that allow remaking relative localization of mobile robots and introduction beginning from the encoder wheel data evaluation. Therefore an effective path following technique is desired to develop an autonomous mobile robot with less odometry error.

The proposed technique describes the dependency of odometry error on wheel velocities. Experiments have been performed by employing a two wheel differential drive mobile robot.

As cloud is storing an enormous amount of digital data engaged with third party services over the internet which raises new security concerns. Efforts are being made by researchers to make cloud secure and reliable computing environment. The technique used in this paper can be recognized as one of the leading methods to secure our sensitive data. The data we used is weather forecasting data which we have accumulated from the website of the government of India. Proposed methodology balances the load of whole data into chunks so that parallel processing will increase and execution time will decrease. Then the whole data are made to undergo map reduce by analysis of filtering and reducing the data with the help of a well known Hadoop framework. There are two main constituents of map reduce: Job follower and Task follower. These constituents will assign the tasks further to slave nodes. It reduces data storage size up to 70%. Reduced data will build more secure by using data leakage detection. Also, when any leakage of data comes to our concern identification of the guilty agent is performed. With the help of s-max algorithm we can conclude that it gives a significant improvement to find a guilty agent in probability with respect to > 0.4 of the reduced data. The level of security is computed or analyzed in the range of 0 to 1, with some probability criteria. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Cloud Security; Data Leakage Detection; Hadoop Framework; Load Balancing; Map Reduce","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Environmental protection; Fiber optic sensors; Network function virtualization; Resource allocation; Weather forecasting; Cloud securities; Computational security; Data leakage; Government of India; Hadoop frameworks; Map-reduce; Parallel processing; Third party services; Data reduction",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043590,,,"English","Proc.

People have started using cloud services but they still have a lot of apprehensions resulting from the lack of trust on Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the associated security risks. In this paper, we have proposed a fuzzy rule-based expert system that evaluates trustworthiness of a CSP from the viewpoint of consumers (called Direct-Trust), their Public-Review, and the Cloud Auditor (called Auditor-Trust). A survey has been conducted to rate the five CSPs on the basis of their Reliability, Performance, Security, and Usability. The data collected from the survey serve as the dataset to calculate the Direct-Trust and Public-Review. Auditor-Trust has been calculated using the data generated by Nasuni, a cloud storage company which evaluates CSPs on the basis of their Performance, Availability, Scalability, and Accuracy.

Methods: To achieve the objective the authors have used the AES algorithm to encrypt the file stored after de-duplication in the cloud. De-duplication is done based on comparison of contents, file type and size. For an authorized user to access the file from the cloud, generation of OTP using SSL protocol is adopted. Findings: Files uploaded in the cloud are encrypted using traditional encryption algorithms which don't provide high levels of security. Files can be accessed by anyone who is authorized. Privileges are not considered. During de-duplication, only the name and size of the files are considered. Application: Files within the public cloud can't be viewed by everyone who has registered with the cloud. Those who have the respective privileges can only view the file. Proof of Ownership is assured. Since de-duplication is done based on the content redundancy within the cloud storage is avoided. Usage of OTP ensures that the content is viewed by the individuals who have the respective privileges related to the file. These concepts provide additional security to the files stored in the public environment. © 2017, IGI Global.","AES; De-Duplication; Duplicate Copies; OTP; Privileges","Authentication; Digital storage; Authentication techniques; De duplications; Duplicate Copies; Encryption algorithms; One time passwords; Privileges; Proof of ownership; Public environment; Cryptography",,,"IGI Global",19301650,,,,"English","Int.

Generally, the users are not aware of the complexity of the applications over which they are expecting fast response. SMD are constrained by their processing speed, storage capacity and many other resources, therefore, to make them to perform well with different types of applications, the concept of mobile cloud is used. Internet of Things (IoT) provides dynamic control and monitoring of energy resources enabling stakeholders to save energy usage at granular levels. With the advancement of IoT technologies and mobile cloud, a new concept is developed called as mobile cloud IoT (MCIoT) which is the convergence of both. The main objective of MCIoT is to provide the sufficient resources to the application so that the application can be executed without any deficiencies. When an application is partitioned complex part is on the cloud and rest is on the SMD, the battery life of the SMD highly improves. In this paper, we have presented an analytical model in MCIoT environment to represent the appropriate partition rate which effects execution time and energy consumption on SMD and cloud. The experiments are conducted on the bases of varying partition rate, bandwidth and data size of an application.

However, the weak endurance of these memory technologies limits their use as a replacement of SRAM. Further, the large intra-set write variation introduced by the application and the existing cache management policies significantly reduces the lifetime of the NVM caches. This paper proposes a technique to reduce intra-set write variation to increase the effective lifetime of the NVM caches. This is achieved by partitioning the cache into equal size windows and using different windows during the execution in order to distribute the writes evenly across the set. Full system simulation results show that our policy reduces the write variation and improves the cache lifetime by 2.1 times and 1.8 times for a single and dual core system, respectively compared to an existing policy. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Static random access storage; VLSI circuits; Cache management policies; Conventional sram; Effective lifetime; Emerging non-volatile memory; Equal sizes; Full-system simulation; Memory technology; Non-volatile; Cache memory",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057405,,,"English","Proc.- Int.

In order to make their storage and transfer efficient, different data compression techniques are used in the literature. The ultimate motive behind data compression is to transform a big size data into small size data, which eventually implies less space while archiving, and less time in transferring. However, in order to operate/analyze compressed data, it is usually necessary to decompress it, so as to bring back the data to its original form, which unfortunately warrants an additional computing cost. In this backdrop, if operating upon the compressed data itself can be made possible without going through the stage of decompression, then the advantage that could be accomplished due to compression would escalate. Further due to compression, from the data structure and storage perspectives, the original visibility structure of the data also being lost, it turns into a potential challenge to trace the original information in the compressed representation. This challenge is the motivation behind exploring the idea of direct processing on the compressed data itself in the literature. The proposed survey paper specifically focuses on compressed document images and brings out two original contributions. The first contribution is that it presents a critical study on different image analysis and image compression techniques, and highlights the motivational reasons for pursuing document image analysis in the compressed domain. The second contribution is that it summarizes the different compressed domain techniques in the literature so far based on the type of compression and operations performed by them. Overall, the paper aims to provide a perspective for pursuing further research in the area of document image analysis and pattern recognition directly based on the compressed data. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Compressed data analysis; Compressed document; Compressed domain; Compressed image processing","Big data; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Government data processing; Image analysis; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Compressed datum; Compressed document; Compressed domain; Compressed images; Compressed-domain techniques; Data compression techniques; Image compression techniques; Internet based application; Image compression","Javed, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, (An Autonomous Institute Under VTU, Belagavi), NMAM Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: javedsolutions@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",02692821,,AIRVE,,"English","Artif Intell Rev",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015724203

In this paper a new Semantic model ontology Database Architectural framework is proposed to implement the Ontology databases efficiently. The proposed work actually concentrates on RDF-ization for converting the XML Records to RDF Records, so that the entire data can be stored into a triple store database. For efficient storage, triple store uses vertical partitioning algorithm for storing data in searchable format. It converts the entire data into indexes and keywords.

Initial storage and pre-processing is done in a big data framework using the well known Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce, and skill-set discovery is accomplished using well-established graph mining techniques.

This exchange may lead to degradation of network performance caused by the ample amount of data exchange between the vehicles. Therefore, a tradeoff between CAM broadcast within the network and optimum utilization of network resources is required. Most of the existing work focuses on retransmission of beacon messages supporting unicast 802.11 models which are not directly suited for the VANET scenario. To deal with this problem, the paper presents a model for non-repetitive single-hop broadcast of CAM within the network, thus supporting IEEE802.11p. For non-repetitive broadcast of CAM, the concept of preemption of messages is introduced in the model. Simulation is carried out using MATLAB 15's Simiilink. The model performance is evaluated by extracting its statistical properties in terms of Channel Utilization, CAM's Average Waiting Time within the queue and Average Queue Length. To validate our model, the simulation is implemented on real world data acquired from wheel speed for all wheels for the duration of a test drive. © 2016 IEEE.","CAM Broadcast; Channel utilization; IEEE 802.11p; Message preemption; Simulink; VANETs","Cams; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; MATLAB; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wheels; Channel utilization; IEEE 802.11p; Message preemption; Simulink; VANETs; Broadcasting",,"Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032518,,,"English","Int.

Each sensor node has very low battery life. Sensor nodes have finite storage capabilities, transmission and processing range and energy resources are also limited. There are many design issues in WSNs such as mobility, energy consumption, network topology, data aggregation, localization, production cost, security, network size and density etc. Routing protocols provide efficient working of the network, increase network lifetime, responsible for maintaining the routes in the network and perform reliable multi-hop communication under various conditions. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Protocol) is one of the hierarchical protocol in WSNs. LEACH uses TDMA MAC Protocol. During random data distribution, a number of TDMA slots are wasted. Because sensor nodes don't know either they have data to send or not, they continuously listen to the medium and this result in idle listening problem. This paper proposed OE-LEACH (An Optimized Energy Efficient LEACH Algorithm for WSNs) to enhance the performance of the LEACH Protocol, reduce time delay and energy consumption. Network Lifetime and throughput of WSN also increases.

It connects objects such as smart phones, sensors, LED(Light Emitting Diodes) displays and even clothes through the internet allowing them to interact and exchange information among themselves. In today's times IoT has found its application in practically every walk of life and inventory management is no exception. At present, inventory management is becoming increasingly complex, where there is an exponential rise in the diversity and number of both products and customers. The biggest problem faced by store owners is to optimize the experience of inventory management along with increased sales and reduced operational costs. With such enormous product lines it becomes extremely difficult for store owners to track and monitor the performance of a product in terms of its sales, shelf life, cost and customer response. IoT acts as a solution to this problem as it facilitates the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in order to interconnect all the various actors in a logistic system. This humongous network of interconnected devices generate massive amounts of data which is difficult to store and process.

The proposed method uses a strategic combination of green and L channel to develop the final vessel structure which increases the accuracy. A combination of morphological operators and intensity based thresholding are used which creates a method which is computationally efficient and less complex.

Hence user can easily access their data from anywhere. At the same time there exist privacy and security issues due to many reasons. First one is dramatic development in network technologies. Another is increased demand for computing resources, which make many organizations to outsource their data storage. So there is a need for secure cloud storage service in public cloud environment where the provider is not a trusted one. This paper addresses different data security and privacy protection issues in a cloud computing environment and proposes a method for providing different security services like authentication, authorization and confidentiality along with monitoring in delay. 128 bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used for increase data security and confidentiality.

The universal use of internet for communication has increased the attacks to users. The security of information is the present issue related to privacy and safety during storage and communication. Cryptography and Steganography are two popular ways of sending essential information in a confidential way. Cryptography is the method of converting plain text into cipher text but in Steganography messages are converted into an encrypted format using a key and then this cipher text is hidden into an image, audio or video file as per user's choice. The information-hiding process in a steganographic system starts by identifying a cover medium's redundant bits (those that can be modified without destroying that medium's integrity). The embedding process starts with creating a stego medium by replacing these redundant bits with data from the hidden message. In this paper, we present a novel approach to resolve the remained problems such as robustness and capacity of image and video Steganography. In the proposed algorithm, message bits are clustered and grouped together using K-Means clustering and then the clustered message is embedded inside the cover medium by using direct mapping which result increase the robustness and capacity of the cover medium. The robustness specially would be increased against those intended attacks which try to reveal the hidden message and also some unintended attacks like noise addition as well. © 2016 IEEE.","Formatting; Insert; Style; Styling","Automation; Cryptography; Digital communication systems; Digital storage; Mapping; Process control; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Video signal processing; Digital communications; Formatting; Information hiding; Insert; Steganographic system; Style; Styling; Video steganography; Steganography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509020805,,,"English","Int.

The majority of the user response time is actually spent waiting for a disk I/O to occur. By making good use of caches in memory and reducing I/O overhead, you can optimize performance. The goal is to retrieve data from memory whenever you can and to use the CPU for other activities whenever you have to wait for I/Os. This paper examines ways to optimize the performance of the system by taking advantage of caching and effective use of the system's CPUs. © 2016 IEEE.","I/O; RDBMS; Tuning","Digital storage; Program processors; Tuning; Disk I/O; Memory management; RDBMS; Storage component; System memory; User response time; Cache memory",,"Prakash G.L.Verma M.Agrawal A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509032570,,,"English","Proc.

Over recent years, the analytics on healthcare big data has evolved into a challenging task for getting insights into a very large data set for improving the health services. This enormous amount of data, which is being generated incessantly over a long period of time, has put a great deal of stress on the write performance as well as on scalability. Moreover, there is a requirement of efficient storage and meaningful processing of these data which is an another challenging issue. The traditional relational databases, which were used in the storage of health data, are now unable to handle due to its massive and varied nature. Besides, these databases have some inherent weakness in terms of scalability, storing varied data format, etc. So there is a necessity for a new kind of data storage management system. This paper proposes a new big data storage architecture consisting of application cluster and a storage cluster to facilitate read/write/update speedup as well as data optimization. The application cluster is used to provide efficient storage and retrieval functions from the users. The storage services will be provided through the storage cluster. © 2016 IEEE.","Health big data; In memory data processing system; In memory storage system","Cluster computing; Computer privacy; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Health care; Information management; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Scalability; Social sciences computing; Storage management; Application clusters; Data processing systems; Data storage management; Health informatics; Memory storage; Relational Database; Storage and retrievals; Storage architectures; Big data",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043149,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The storage of personal information on cloud servers may result in the exposure of confidential information to unauthorized individuals or organizations. Several solutions employing attribute-based encryption schemes have been proposed for secure sharing of data using cloud servers. However, most of the solutions fail to trace the traitors, who intentionally leaked their data access privileges for personal gain. This paper introduces a traceable ciphertext policy attribute-based signcryption (sign-then-encrypt) scheme to simultaneously realize the notion of traitor-tracing, fine-grained access control, sender anonymity, message integrity, authenticity and sensitivity by extending traceable attribute based encryption scheme using attribute-based signature. Single authority may compromise user's key. Hence to reduce the trust on authority, our proposed scheme employs different authorities for key generation and traitor-tracing. In addition, our proposed scheme preserves message sensitivity by allowing the data-owner to define message category label. We analyze the performance of our scheme with respect to secret key size, ciphertext size, computation cost involves in signcryption and designcryption and compare it with existing schemes to show its efficacy. © 2016 IEEE.","Access control; Anonymity; Authenticity; Cloud computing; Privacy; Security; Traitor-tracing; Unforgeability","Access control; Authentication; Big data; Cloud computing; Computer privacy; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Multimedia services; Security of data; Social sciences computing; Anonymity; Authenticity; Security; Traitor tracing; Unforgeability; Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043149,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

This advancement in ICT has created an explosive growth in digital data with almost every industry and business area digitizing their data ushering in the dawn of an era of big data in India. Financial frauds have emerged as an undesirable and inescapable byproduct of this economic growth with numerous chit fund and MLM companies coming under the scanner of government agencies such as SFIO, SEBI and ED for fraudulent activities. To combat the growing menace of fraud with clinching evidences present in the form of digital data, it has become imperative to develop tools and technologies to understand the massive amounts of digital data being collected by government agencies. The paper focuses on various tools and technologies which are currently being used for fraud analysis. Further, it presents a fund flow algorithm that could be used to detect dubious fund transactions using bank transaction statements by analyzing the fund flow between various entities. It takes as input the bank transaction data of various parties of interest and generates as output a directed graph with nodes depicting the source and destination of fund transfer and directed arrows showing the direction of fund flow.

Diagnostic data exportation by the BIST is time - consuming since it is exported bit-by-bit. To overcome this, a BIST with March-element-based (MEB) Compression scheme is proposed. MEB Compression scheme can efficiently compress the diagnostic data of a RAM tested by a March test. To optimize the performance of the BIST controller, another design is also proposed here. Detection of different faults in a RAM memory using a single counter based BIST design is advantageous. As a result a fusion of March algorithms like MATS, March C and March X are used for the detection of Stuck-at fault, Coupling fault and Transition fault respectively. Advantages of counter-based BIST architecture includes reduced area overhead and complexity. Compression of the test data is carried out using a decoder module. The implementations are carried out by using Verilog Hardware description language and Xilinx ISE 13.2 design suite. Experimental results shows that the proposed methods reduces the fault detection time, redundant diagnostic data, tester storage requirement, area overhead and complexity in the design. © 2016 IEEE.","Built-in self-test; Coupling fault; March algorithms; March X; MarchC; MATS; Stuck-at fault; Transition fault","Built-in self test; Computer hardware description languages; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit testing; Memory architecture; Random access storage; System-on-chip; Coupling faults; March algorithm; March X; MarchC; MATS; Stuck-at faults; Transition faults; Fault detection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037513,,,"English","Proc.

With the number of cloud applications is increasing, the data security becomes an major concern in the cloud. The open source software Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is used to build cloud storage system which will allow to store large data with high throughput and fault tolerance. Originally the Hadoop system was designed without any security model, so security is the major weakness of Hadoop in its development. As far as storage of sensitive data is concerned in the Hadoop, data security will be an important issue. With the increase in the acceptance of Hadoop, there is also raising trend in incorporating more and more security features in enterprises. Also demand of encryption of the data is increased to secure the confidential data and to prevent privacy rule violation. Over the period of recent years efforts have been made in order to obtain some level of security in Hadoop such as Kerberos and Transparent Data Encryption(TDE) for Hadoop.

For identity authentication purposes, multiple watermarks are embedded into the same medical image / multimedia objects simultaneously, which provides extra level of security with acceptable performance in terms of robustness and imperceptibility. In the embedding process, the cover image is decomposed into first level discrete wavelet transforms where the A (approximation/lower frequency sub-band) is transformed by DCT and SVD. The watermark image is also transformed by DWT, DCT and SVD. The S vector of watermark information is embedded in the S component of the cover image. The watermarked image is generated by inverse SVD on modified S vector and original U, V vectors followed by inverse DCT and inverse DWT. The watermark is extracted using an extraction algorithm. Furthermore, the text watermark is embedding at the second level of the D (diagonal sub-band) of the cover image. The security of the text watermark considered as EPR (Electronic Patient Record) data is enhanced by using encryption method before embedding into the cover. The results are obtained by varying the gain factor, size of the text watermark, and cover medical images.

Over the past few years, numerous cloud service providers have been emerged providing similar kinds of services. It has become incredibly complex for the cloud clients to make a distinction among multiple cloud service providers offering similar kinds of services. Cloud clients need trustworthy service providers who provide services exactly as per the SLA and do not deviate from their promises. Though, there have been significant efforts to form trust between service providers and the clients by providing data, storage and network security, but relatively fewer efforts have been made in the field of trustworthiness determination by monitoring the compliance of offered services as per the SLA. This paper presents the design of a trust evaluation framework that uses the compliance monitoring mechanism to determine the trustworthiness of service providers. The compliance values are computed and then processed using a technique known as the Improved Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Improved TOPSIS) to obtain trust on the service providers. Case study based approach has been followed to demonstrate the usability and the applicability of the proposed framework. Experiments have been performed using the real cloud data extracted from the Cloud Harmony reports. From the experimental results, it is clear that the proposed framework can be used in real cloud environments to determine the trustworthiness of service providers by employing the real time monitoring of their services. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cloud computing; Compliance; Improved TOPSIS; SLA; Trust; Trustworthiness","Cloud computing; Complex networks; Compliant mechanisms; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Network security; Cloud service providers; Compliance; Compliance monitoring; Improved techniques; Improved TOPSIS; Real time monitoring; Trust; Trustworthiness; Trusted computing","Singh, S.; Computer Science and Engineering, UIET, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: sarbjeet@pu.ac.in",,"Springer Netherlands",15707873,,,,"English","J.

Parallelization of 3D Kirchhoff depth migration is challenging due to its high demand of compute time, memory, storage and I/O along with the need of their effective management. The most resource intensive modules of the algorithm are traveltime calculations and migration summation which exhibit an inherent trade off between compute time and other resources. The parallelization strategy of the algorithm largely depends on the storage of calculated traveltimes and its feeding mechanism to the migration process. The presented work is an extension of our previous work, wherein a 3D Kirchhoff depth migration application for multicore CPU based parallel system had been developed. Recently, we have worked on improving parallel performance of this application by re-designing the parallelization approach. The new algorithm is capable to efficiently migrate both prestack and poststack 3D data. It exhibits flexibility for migrating large number of traces within the available node memory and with minimal requirement of storage, I/O and inter-node communication. The resultant application is tested using 3D Overthrust data on PARAM Yuva II, which is a Xeon E5-2670 based multicore CPU cluster with 16 cores/node and 64 GB shared memory. Parallel performance of the algorithm is studied using different numerical experiments and the scalability results show striking improvement over its previous version. An impressive 49.05X speedup with 76.64% efficiency is achieved for 3D prestack data and 32.00X speedup with 50.00% efficiency for 3D poststack data, using 64 nodes. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the improved algorithm with high scalability and efficiency on a multicore CPU cluster. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Scalability; Effective management; Feeding mechanism; High scalabilities; Inter-node communication; Kirchhoff depth migration; Numerical experiments; Parallel performance; Parallelization strategies; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; prestack migration; seismic data; three-dimensional modeling","Rastogi, R.; Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Savitribai Phule Pune University campusIndia; email: richar@cdac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",00983004,,CGEOD,,"English","Comput.

Due to limited resources of handheld devices, multimedia content handling becomes more complex task which can be resolved by using the popular field called cloud computing. The resource handling can be optimized by maintaining both private (permanent storage) and public (temporary and emergency storage) clouds, so that user can respond with required multimedia contents without interruption. However the multimedia provisioning such as video, audio and games downloading through cloud affects the profit of both cloud users and cloud providers if it is not handled with more concern.

Existing model of data organization and processing in Hadoop using HDFS and MapReduce are ideally tailored for search and data parallel applications, for which there is no need of data dependency with its neighboring/adjacent data. However, many scientific applications such as image mining, data mining, knowledge data mining, and satellite image processing are dependent on adjacent data for processing and analysis. In this paper, we identify the requirements of the overlapped data organization and propose a two-phase extension to HDFS and MapReduce programming model, called XHAMI, to address them. The extended interfaces are presented as APIs and implemented in the context of image processing application domain. We demonstrated effectiveness of XHAMI through case studies of image processing functions along with the results. Although XHAMI has little overhead in data storage and input/output operations, it greatly enhances the system performance and simplifies the application development process.

In this article, we study sectored DRAM caches that exercise large allocation units called sectors, invest reasonably small storage to maintain tag/state, enable space- and bandwidth-efficient tag/state caching due to low tag working set size and large data coverage per tag element, and minimize main memory bandwidth wastage by fetching only the useful portions of an allocated sector. However, the sectored caches suffer from poor space utilization, since a large sector is always allocated even if the sector utilization is low. The recently proposed Unison cache addresses only a special case of this problem by not allocating the sectors that have only one active block. We propose Micro-sector cache, a locality-aware sectored DRAM cache architecture that features a flexible mechanism to allocate cache blocks within a sector and a locality-aware sector replacement algorithm. Simulation studies on a set of 30 16-way multi-programmed workloads show that our proposal, when incorporated in an optimized Unison cache baseline, improves performance (weighted speedup) by 8%, 14%, and 16% on average, respectively, for 1KB, 2KB, and 4KB sectors at 128MB capacity. These performance improvements result from significantly better cache space utilization, leading to 18%, 21%, and 22% average reduction in DRAM cache read misses, respectively, for 1KB, 2KB, and 4KB sectors at 128MB capacity. We evaluate our proposal for DRAM cache capacities ranging from 128MB to 1GB. © 2017 ACM 1544-3566/2017/03-ART7 $15.00.","DRAM cache; Sectored cache; Space utilization","Bandwidth; Digital storage; Bandwidth efficient; Cache architecture; Flexible mechanisms; Recent researches; Replacement algorithm; Sectored cache; Simulation studies; Space utilization; Dynamic random access storage",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15443566,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

Let sN (m,n,t) be the minimum number of bits of storage needed for such a scheme. Buhrman, Miltersen, Radhakrishnan, and Srinivasan [4] and Alon and Feige [1] investigated sN(m,n,t) for various ranges of the parameter t. We show the following. General upper bound (t ≥ 5 and odd): For odd t ≥ 5, sN(m, n,t) = O(tm2/t-1 n1- 2/t-1 lg 2m/n). This improves on a result of Buhrman et al. that states for odd t ≥ 5, sN(m,n,t) = O(m4/t+1n). For small values of t (odd t ≥ 3 and t ≤ 1/10 lg lg m) and n ≤ m1-ϵ (ϵ &gt; 0), we obtain adaptive schemes that use a little less space: O(exp(e2t)m 2/t+1 n1-2/t+1 lg m). Three probes (t = 3) lower bound: We show that sN(m,n,3) = Ω(√mn) for n ≥ n0 for some constant n0. This improves on a result of Alon and Feige that states that for n ≥ 16 lg m, sN(m, n, 3) = Ω(√mn/lg m). The complexity of the non-adaptive scheme might, in principle, depend on the function that is used to determine the answer based on the three bits read (one may assume that all queries use the same function. Let sf N(m,n,3) be the minimum number of bits of storage required in a three-probe non-adaptive scheme where the function f: {0, 1}3 → {0,1} is used to answer the queries. We show that for large class of functions f (including the majority function on three bits), we in fact have sN(m, n, 3) = Ω(m1-1/cn) for n ≥ 4 and some c &gt; 0. In particular, three-probe non-adaptive schemes that use such query functions f do not give any asymptotic savings over the trivial characteristic vector when n ≥ log m. © Mohit Garg and Jaikumar Radhakrishnan.","Bit-probe model; Bloom filters; Compression; Data structures; Expansion","C (programming language); Compaction; Data structures; Digital storage; Expansion; Query processing; Bit-probe complexity; Bit-probe models; Bloom filters; Characteristic vectors; General upper bound; Majority functions; Membership query; Query functions; Probes",,"Vallee B.Vollmer H.","Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9783959770286,,,"English","Leibniz Int.

Data grid relies on data replicas to enhance the performance and to ensure the fault tolerant results to the users. Replicas are developed to increase the availability of data and to provide better data access. Replicas have their own advantages, but there are a number of issues that must be resolved. Among various existing issues, the critical concern is replica consistency. Various replica consistency strategies are available in the literature. These strategies rationalize and investigate various parameters like bandwidth consumption, access cost, scalability, execution time, storage consumption, staleness, and freshness of replicas. In this paper, several asynchronous replica consistencies are classified and analyzed based on various strategies such as topology, level of abstraction, update propagation, and locality. Some other strategies are also discussed and analyzed like adaptive consistency, quorum-based consistency, load balancing, and agent-based economically efficient, check-pointing, fault tolerance, and conflict management. Parameters on which these strategies are analyzed are methodology, replication classification, consistency, grid topology, environment, evaluation parameters, and performance.

Big data is now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, owing to the fast development of networking, data storage, and data collection capacity. Big data mining is the capability of extracting useful information from these large datasets. Nowadays, the integration of cloud computing with the data mining for the big data mining process is a challenging task. In order to process the huge amount of data, it is necessary to concentrate the improvement on the big data computation. Most of the existing approaches use the MapReduce to compute the big data. The increase in the computational cost and memory consumption are the main drawbacks of the existing approaches. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a similarity-based clustering and optimum cache replacement approach for big data computing applications. The job recovery process is initiated by copying the data in the cloud server and forwarding the data copy for further processing. Then, the job is divided into clusters based on the similarity-based clustering approach. Finally, the cache concept is introduced with the optimum cache replacement algorithm to avoid repeated execution of the jobs by queue management. The proposed approach is compared with the existing Spark and Hadoop approaches. The proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of iteration time, query response time, job completion time, and clustering accuracy. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this way, some multipower (Multi-Authority) plans are proposed, in which various powers independently keep up disjoint trait subsets. In any case, the single-point bottleneck issue stays unsolved. In this paper, from another point of view, we lead an edge multi-power CPABE access control plan for open distributed storage, named TMACS, in which various powers together deal with a uniform characteristic set. In [9] TMACS, exploiting (t; n) limit mystery sharing, the expert (Master) key can be shared among numerous powers, and a legitimate client can produce his/her mystery (Private) key by cooperating with any t powers.

The cloud nodes are aligned with certain distance using the concept T-coloring where an attacker is unable to track the next node. To improve the retrieval time the fragments are replicated over the nodes which are remained by placing the fragments. To enhance the security standard the fragmented file is encrypted before placement on cloud node. An auditing scheme is employed which continually monitor the cloud nodes.

It differs from traditional way in requesting in which request and data packet is delivered with the help of content identification and not the IP addresses of server and client. By using this trend we can apply more security to the clients because there will be no IP addresses available which will help to hide the identity of a client. So the traditional algorithms are not easy to execute and have problems while accessing the content. If we do so the results comes into Dos Attack and corrupt data in ease of use. And sender has to do tough job for controlling the data access and cache it by client and other nodes. More effective results can be obtained by putting the new concept i.e. minimizing the computation overhead of verification procedure and reliability of user by making it trivial. Also to minimize the storage overhead of storing the group based key management system is added to the network. The Proposed System helps us to verify the content universally by using the algorithm given in the system. Also this algorithmic strategy provides security for content provider to control the downloading of data by unknown user.

Due to the increase in the usage of the technology, there exists a high chance of compromising the security of the data being stored on the cloud. The major hindrance in the usage of the technology is the security concerns which accompany it. This increases the demand for a robust security mechanism to protect the data on the cloud. So as to overcome this drawback of cloud computing, encrypting the data to be stored on the cloud is one of the solutions. As part of this paper, a security mechanism to improve the security of data in cloud storage is suggested. The security mechanism used is inspired by the bio-inspired genetic algorithm. The inspiration behind the proposed security model is an amalgamation of genetic algorithm and attribute based encryption. As per the methodology proposed the data need to be encrypted before being stored on the cloud. This way the cloud service provider is unaware of the data being stored and even if the data is compromised to some third party, there is no information leakage. © 2016 IEEE.","Attribute-based Encryption Algorithm; Bio-inspired algorithms; Cloud Computing; Cloud Security; Cloud Storage; Genetic Algorithm","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Genetic algorithms; Metals; Network security; Security of data; Attribute-based encryptions; Bio-inspired algorithms; Bio-inspired Models; Cloud securities; Cloud service providers; Cloud storages; Information leakage; Security mechanism; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509026128,,,"English","Int.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm for evaluating driver performance using vehicle state data. This indirect method of evaluation has the advantage of being unobtrusive and cheap as it uses only the easily accessible real time vehicle data. The proposed algorithm can eliminate subjectivity and automate the evaluation process. The driver being evaluated is asked to maintain lane center and drive smoothly while steering input, pedal position and acceleration data is collected. Steering activity is evaluated by defining an optimal input for lane keeping and comparing driver's input. Wheel slip and cornering conditions are considered for pedal activity evaluation. Vehicle acceleration data is used for estimating passenger comfort. An instantaneous and average index of performance is generated in real time as a final evaluation metric combining the three evaluation criteria.

This paper proposes three-level flying capacitor inverter based distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) for shunt applications. A new floating capacitors voltage balancing schemes using loss balancing technique has been suggested to balance capacitor voltages. Because of benefits like simplicity, transformation less implementation, and scope of desired power factor setting; a generalized instantaneous symmetrical component theory is incorporated to extract the reference compensator current. A basic three-level hysteresis controller is used to control the injected current by inverter so that it follows its reference value. DSTATCOM is applied to a three phase four wire (3p4w) distribution network and its effective performance is demonstrated in terms of floating capacitor voltage regulation, tracking performance and load compensation.

Therefore; the battery is discharged only under bad climate condition or at night when the PV array is insufficient to feed the water pump. Additionally; it is charged by the SPV array when the water delivery is not required. Thus; no external supply is used for the battery charging.

Inverted pendulum qualifies as a benchmark system to test the suitability of controller design for under-actuated, nonlinear unstable system. In this context, H∞ based integral sliding mode controller is designed for inverted pendulum for stabilizing the system. The H∞ state feedback gains are obtained by formulating the Riccati equation. These gains stabilize not only the closed loop transfer function, which maps the performance output to the disturbance input but also the system around its unstable equilibrium point. However this will not account for parameter variation and disturbance effect. Hence, a robust integral sliding surface is constructed such that during sliding motion the closed loop system will lead to disturbance rejection.

This increment leads us to take into account their adverse effects on the power system as it causes the power system signals to carry different frequency components, which generate harmonics in the system. These harmonic components modifies the line admittance matrix, to some unacceptable limits, used for power flow calculations. Such modification results in error during fundamental load flow calculations. In this paper an efficient methodology to locate the harmonic sources and their injection levels has been proposed. Analysis requires the measurement data of phasor measurement units (PMUs) which are costly one. Hence, binary particle swarm optimization algorithm has been proposed for optimal placement of PMUs to get the harmonic data. The proposed harmonic identification approach is centered around the orientation of harmonic power flow at system buses. The proposed methodology is applied and validated for a 18 bus radial distribution system. © 2016 IEEE.","Harmonic analysis method; harmonic injection level; harmonic source identification; phasor measurement units (PMUs)","Electric load flow; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Phase measurement; Power control; Power electronics; Quantum well lasers; Units of measurement; Binary particle swarm optimization; Harmonic analysis method; Harmonic identification; Harmonic injection; Harmonic sources; Phasor measurement unit (PMUs); Power flow calculations; Radial distribution systems; Phasor measurement units",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The topology provides isolation to avoid common mode problems/ leakage currents together with low stresses on the switches making it robust and highly efficient.

DERs can be used to its maximum efficiency through MicroGrid (MG). This also led to a path for Smart MicroGrid (SMG) where DERs are scheduled and dispatched economically as well as eco-friendly. Due to intermittent nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in MG and dynamic nature of demand static dispatch of modern power system is not of any use. Thus, it is very important to research economical scheduling and associated dispatch of power system connected with MG. This considers random variations of DERs referred as dynamic dispatch. This paper presents the economic as well as environmental dispatch scheduling of a power system connected to MG composed of different distributed energy resources and storage devices. The overall generation cost of static and dynamic dispatch of proposed system has also been compared. A mathematical model of given system has been formulated considering all the system constraints and ramp rate constraint of generators to minimize the operational and pollutant treatment cost. The optimization study has been carried out in two different modes: (i) Grid connected with MG; and (ii) Isolated grid operation. Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming technique has been used to solve the Unit Commitment (UC) and dispatch problem. The influence of scheduling strategies on operational cost and pollutant treatment cost has been obtained and compared and the impact of MG interconnection with the power system has been shown in terms of operational cost, pollutant treatment cost, total cost and on the unit commitment of power system to reduce the burden on grid generators. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed Energy Resources; Dynamic Dispatch; Microgrid; Optimization; Scheduling","Costs; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Integer programming; Intelligent control; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Pollution; Power control; Power electronics; Ramp generators; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Virtual storage; Distributed Energy Resources; Dynamic dispatch; Environmental dispatch; Independent power producers; Micro grid; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Renewable energy source; Technological development; Electric load dispatching",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

So, there are many disturbances that occur in the system like voltage sag and swell, fault, unbalance loading, uncontrolled power flow, etc. The SEN transformer (ST) is one of the devices to regulate the power flow in the system. In this paper, the ST has been used to mitigate voltage sag and swell in the transmission line with different phase angle of injecting voltage. The SEN transformer has the advantage of controlling active power flow and reactive power flow in the line independently like UPFC. In this paper, the ST is simulated in MATLAB/ SIMULINK for compensating voltage in transmission line during fault condition for maintaining constant voltage profile of the system.

Though the vector control of induction motor is fast and efficient for variable speed operation, it is not worth using in applications such as electric vehicles where changes in speeds are not as fast as in servo applications. The proposed controller uses an improved form of traditional scalar methodology with the addition of current loop. The motor torque is varied in terms of motor control voltage in closed current loop using dc current sensor. The improved scalar works in a closed loop for automatic adjustment of torque value and does not use any external speed sensor. A multi-slope voltage/frequency (V/Hz) ramp allows the induction motor to operate in the required torque-speed profile of the EV at its optimum efficiency values in all operating conditions. Initially, the effectiveness of the improved scalar control algorithm is evaluated by conducting appropriate simulations. The control algorithm is developed on TMS320F28335 digital signal processor from Texas Instruments.

Using wind power to produce electricity is a perfect fit. Because wind energy has become the least expensive source of new electric power that is also compatible with environment preservation programs many countries promote wind power technology by means of national programs and market incentives. Also it provides an effective solution for reduction of fossil fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. The wind turbines are used for the generation of wind energy, simple in construction, economical and which gives appreciable output. Wind shear is one of the major factors affecting the working of wind turbines. Vertical shear, or the change of winds with height, either enhances or diminishes the vertical draft strengths. Input parameters and output parameters vary with different turbines. Flicker voltage is one of the major parameter concerned with the wind turbine parameters. Voltage flicker are caused due to heavy loads periodically turned on and off in a weak distribution system.

Broadly simulation can be of two types, Off-line and Real-Time Simulation. Off-line simulation uses a digital computer and real time simulation uses a dedicated high speed digital processing hardware. Real time simulation allows analysis of a physical system in real-Time. Full Spectrum Simulator (FSS) provides both off-line and real-Time simulation capabilities at an affordable cost, easily configurable for custom applications. FSS is useful for real-Time simulation of large power systems and power electronic equipments. Applications of real-Time simulation includes training and demonstration of power electronic systems, closed loop testing of power subsystem protective relays, evaluation of control hardware and software and testing of high power systems like FACTS devices, Custom Power devices, AC/DC motor drives etc. This paper deals with simulation of a DC-DC fly back converter in real-Time using FSS Mini. For real-Time simulation using FSS, the main objective was to create an average model of the fly back converter in CCM mode of operation. Average model was derived from the circuit equations and designed the values of the parameters used in the averaged model. Simulation using MATLAB was done first and obtained the output voltage waveform. Same equations were used for creating the library element in the real-Time simulation library. Then it was simulated using FSS and obtained the real-Time simulation output in a DSO. © 2016 IEEE.","Average Modelling; DC-DC Flyback Converter; FSS; Real time Simulation","AC motors; Application programs; Closed loop control systems; Computer hardware; Computer software; DC-DC converters; Digital computers; Digital instruments; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Flexible AC transmission systems; Hardware; Intelligent systems; MATLAB; Power converters; Power electronics; Rectifying circuits; Software testing; Transients; Closed-loop testing; Custom Power device; Flyback converters; Large power systems; Off-line simulations; Power electronic systems; Processing hardware; Real time simulations; Real time systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509008704,,,"English","Int.

As power and voltage rating increases; device constraint as well ashigh switching loss creates serious problems. Various pulse width modulated strategies like sinusoidal; 3rd harmonic injection and space vector PWM (SVPWM) employs high frequency switching to obtain quality output voltage with less ripple. Increasing number of voltage levels in a multi-level inverter requires an increase in number of active switches and passive elements. The problem of dead time requirement and shoot-through in PWM inverters distorts the output waveform and transfers less energy to load. A new type of three-phase VSI called three-phase Infinite Level Inverter (ILI) is proposed to mitigate all the above problems to a large extent. The device constraint and switching loss at high frequency is substantially reduced due to lower input DC supply. To get same output voltage; the proposed inverter requires only half of the DC link voltage compared to sine PWM inverter. Also; ILI takes only 0.576 times the input DC voltage compared to 3rd harmonic-injection or SVPWM. This shows that the proposed inverter has the maximum DC link utilization. The number of active switches and passive elements are same for any number of voltage levels. This topology is a multi-level inverter as there are many levels in the output voltage. Shoot-through problem is avoided and thus the proposed inverter doesn't need a dead time; leading to a better system reliability. Hysteresis current control is used for closed loop control. Results obtained from experimental setup and computer simulation using MATLAB/Simulink are presented to verify the above scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","High DC Link Utilization; Multi-level Inverter; Three-phase PWM Inverter","Electric current control; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Power control; Power electronics; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Closed-loop control; DC links; High-frequency switching; Hysteresis current control; Multilevel inverter; Pulse width modulated voltage source inverters; Pulse-width-modulated; PWM inverter; Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A solar cell being the smallest energy unit of any solar power system, an array of such solar cells constitutes a solar panel. The output of a solar panel follows a nonlinear current voltage characteristic which depends primarily on irradiance, temperature and load connected. A distinct point for fixed atmospheric conditions for which maximum power is extracted from the panel is the Maximum Power Point(MPP). A number of constraints are associated with installing, operating and thus studying the behaviour and designing a power system for solar panels. This paper thus discusses about the design of prototype indoor solar panel simulator along with the design of a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) System. Using this design efficiently, a large range of panels for various dynamic atmospheric conditions can be simulated. Various MPPT algorithms can be tested and analysed for their performance in actual solar power systems.

Transformer plays a vital role in the power system as it acts as the heart of power supply. Failure of transformer leads to malfunction of the whole power system. Unfortunately; the failure rate of the power transformer in India is 25% per annum as against less than 1% in the developed country. So monitoring the health of a transformer is essential. The health of a transformer depends on the condition of insulation winding. The power factor of the solid insulation winding is a critical parameter to adjudge its condition under real operating condition. Two in service generator transformers each of rating 4.9MVA were investigated to calculate its power factor with DOBLE M4100 insulation analyzer. Several other tests like DGA; HPLC and MOISTURE CONTENT were performed to finally conclude the condition of insulation winding. During the testing phase; several interesting results have been found which must be considered while determining the condition of the insulation winding. The results concluded that the high power factor was not only because of the degradation of paper but also due to the moisture content in the paper. © 2016 IEEE.","Furans; High-performance Liquid Chromatography; Insulation Deterioration; Moisture Equilibrium; Power Factor; Watt Loss","Electric generators; Electric power factor; Electric power systems; Failure analysis; High performance liquid chromatography; Insulation; Intelligent control; Liquid chromatography; Moisture; Moisture determination; Outages; Power electronics; Power transformers; Winding; Developed countries; Electrical equipment; Furans; Insulation deterioration; Moisture equilibrium; Oil immersed transformers; Power factors; Real operating conditions; Power control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

It works on the principle of Faraday's and Ampere's law. RC can be used to measure both high speed impulse and alternating currents. RC offers some very important properties like wide bandwidth, galvanic isolation, linearity, lightness and cheap. Presence of all these properties makes RC better than conventional current transducers. It also offers many other applications viz., energy management, protection systems, CT calibration, current sharing, resistance, welding process, measurement of partial discharges and earth resistance of transmission towers. It can measure currents ranging from mili-amperes (mA) to mega-amperes (MA) without any saturation. The construction and measurement conditions decide the application of RC. The eccentricity of coil is the main parameter considered for modelling of RC. The eccentricity effect becomes prominent when the conductor gets displaced away from the centre due to the deviation from circular shape. Change in conductor position affects the measurements done, so this analysis ensures the accuracy of RC. In this paper, eccentricity analysis of RC is done using ANSYS software tool. The observed deviation of mutual inductance during the analysis can be justified with the theoretical existing data. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Transformers; Distributed Parameters; Eccentricity; FE Analysis; Rogowski coil","Electric equipment protection; Electric instrument transformers; Electric power transmission; Electric resistance; Electric transformers; Inductance; Intelligent control; Partial discharges; Power electronics; Alternating current; Conventional currents; Distributed parameter; Eccentricity; Eccentricity effects; FE analysis; Measurement conditions; Rogowski Coil; Power control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

For detection of characteristic fault frequencies current spectrum is being used. In the presence of any fault, the frequency spectrum of the motor current changed from healthy motor.

But in domino logic excess power dissipation is observed because of precharge propagation, which is solved by using pseudo dynamic buffer (PDB) model. Using PDB we can save almost 67% of power. While succeeding to stop precharge propagation in domino logic PDB allows logic 1 to logic 0 transitions, this may cause erroneous output while cascading. Here we proposed footed quasi resistance (FQR) model modified from PDB which is having advantages of PDB and can avoid logic 1 to logic 0 transitions at output. By using FQR we can get maximum of 57% power saving compared to domino logic, which is worthwhile to get faultless output in cascaded logic circuits.

Formation of islanding phenomenon is one of the major issued problem confronted with this kind of power generation scheme, in which DG source may keep working in a stable or normal way even if main electric power system (EPS) has failed. There are various methodologies have been evolved and advanced to avert this situation. They are classified as detection through passive method, active and communication systems based method. Islanding occurrences is the most issued problem in a recent time power system working along with the DG. A variety of problems occur when a solar Photovoltaic is working as distributed generated (DG) source. Islanding refers to a condition when a DG source continues to supply power to a load even though there is no power from the main source during the disconnection from the main grid at the occurrence of fault or some other severe phenomenon, refers to a situation or condition called islanding. When workers who may not perceive that the load is still powered after the disconnection from the EPS or main source so this condition can be dangerous to the grid workers. When this condition occur the DG source should gets immediately disconnected from the local load in minimum time delay. Islanding causes unfavorable effects which are low power quality, personnel potential danger, grid-protection interference and equipment damage. Islanding can causes very dangerous or abnormal situation for both people and apparatus, So islanding should be quickly determine by inverters and protective relays. Islanding finding out through passive method examines system specification without inducing any interruption and disturbance into the grid (EPS).

To mitigate this difficulty and power fluctuations at the load end, a possible solution could be the integration of battery energy storage with PV system. The Storage system can potentially improve security, quality, reliability and availability of electricity supply from Solar PV power system. The Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) [1] is promising energy storage for reliability, scalability and deep discharge capacity. This paper presents an optimized power management scheme for solar PV power driven DC pump with energy storage for rural irrigation. The integrated PV system will supply power to the required demand of the 2 HP DC pump and excess power will charge the battery via a suitable DC-DC boost Converter [2]. During PV Power generation deficiency, the battery will be in discharging mode to supply the required power to drive the pump depending on its State of Charge (SOC) [3] and thus smoothens the transient power during that period. The PV output power is enhanced by implementing Perturb and observe (P&O) MPPT algorithm [4-5] under a set of practical insolation data. A 6kWh, 39 cells VRB storage [6] system has been modeled in MATLAB/ Simulink environment and the charge-discharge algorithm is decided based on real time VRFB State of Charge (SOC) prediction and Solar PV generation.

For the rural areas it becomes more difficult to provide 24 hours continuous supply on daily basis. Along with this difficulty there is another problem of continuous day by day degradation of conventional energy resources. For rural electrification the use of hybrid energy resources is becoming more attractive solution. The hybrid system can be a combination of different nonconventional resources like PV; DG; Battery and converter etc. With these resources the system can maintain its reliability. This paper presents simulation and optimization of a hybrid based power generation system using PV array and Diesel generator. The simulation and optimization is done using 'Homer' software. The hybrid system is designed as to completely fulfill the demand of the consumer of Sotai village at latitude (28°17′16″) and longitude (77°21′35″) of district Faridabad in Haryana. In this village only about 12 hours electricity is provided from grid therefore electric supply is not reliable and the consumers demand cannot be completely fulfilled. The area chosen has a power demand of 11937.65 kWh/day and solar radiation is about 5.14 kWh/m2/day.

For the proposed iris recognition technique, self mutated hybrid wavelet transform of Cosine-Walsh, Cosine-Kekre and Cosine-Sine are used to generate transformed iris images. Considering all the coefficients for 100% of energy, feature vector of transformed iris image is generated, thus the size of feature vector becomes extremely large. For proposed Iris recognition technique, 99%, 98%, 97% and 96% of partial energies are considered, thus the number of coefficients considered to generate the feature vector are very less and the size of feature vector reduces severely. Accuracy using partial energies is high as compared to 100% of energy. The self mutated hybrid wavelet transform gives improvement in Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) and faster recognition.

A CSKA consists of blocks of full adder combined together, whose schematic (i.e., combination of full adders per block) mainly affects the overall operating speed of carry skip adder. These FA blocks are interconnected through 2/1 multiplexers. Worst case delay can be reduced with different techniques which has been proposed for full adders, this paper provides an optimization technique only for the case of constant block size to improve the speed performance.

Utilizing electricity efficiently and reducing its wastage as much as possible is an important criterion considering the depleting natural reserves of fossil fuel traditionally used for its generation. The ever increasing demand of electricity places its judicious and efficient use at a prime importance for its consumers. This paved the way for developing appliance based automation for energy conservation. In an educational institution like college or university that has comparatively large infrastructure, it is quite difficult to regulate appliances manually 24/7 throughout the year.

The waves produce humungous amounts of energy and therefore the study of different characteristics associated with waves becomes an important aspect. One such characteristic is the wave height. The height of a wave determines the impact that it would have when it hits the surface thereby playing a crucial role in deciding the quality and commercial viability of a beach and in determining the extent of transportation of sediments to proximate coastal areas. If the wave becomes very vigorous then it would pose a serious threat to the lives of the people inhabiting coastal areas. Therefore the analysis of different characteristics of waves becomes all the more important. In this paper, we have presented a statistical estimation of one such characteristic namely the wave height, which is also one of the most significant parameters used for estimating wave energy. In our review, we have used fundamental distribution functions to model the wave height, and have calculated error using various error detection tests thereby concluding the best fit for wave height.

Both these parameters are abruptly affected by the switching transient and faults that occur in power system network. Switching transient is common phenomena caused by capacitor bank present in power system. Energizing the capacitor that is present in the power system network causes inrush current and transient over voltage in the network, that is not only affects the quality of the power flow in the system but also affect the life cycle of capacitor bank as well as the circuit breaker. This paper deals with detail working of newly proposed system providing immense combination of resistance and reactance in the economical single static reactor connected through three phase isolated transformers at the time of charging of capacitor, through which it suppresses the energizing transient of 3 phase capacitors. In bypass mode, all the element of newly proposed system which consists of diode and IGBT start conducting simultaneously the surge voltage of primary side of isolated transformer exploit as short circuited and the secondary side's surge voltage approximately zero. Due to presence of freewheeling diode in the system, no surges in voltage appear across circuit breaker, due to which the life span of circuit and equipment increases.

Distributed Generation (DG) is assuming widespread popularity owing to its potential to solve numerous issues like the power system de-regulation; meeting the rising power demand; improving voltage profile; reduction in power losses etc. The Optimum Location of DG and optimum DG Sizing are the two critical issues in the integration of DG with the electric grid because the improper placement and improper sizing of DG in power system can not only leads to the enhanced total power losses but can also damage the normal operation of power system. Optimal placement of DG units is a nonlinear optimization problem. This paper proposes a methodology to calculate the optimal location and effective optimal size. The influence of variation in location of DG with respect to the total power losses and voltage in the system is also carried out.

The wind power is generated using the permanent magnet brushless DC generator (PMBLDCG) and the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) is executed with P&O (Perturb & Observe) approach to extract the maximum power from the wind generation. This power is fed to the AC load using a voltage source inverter (VSI) through the battery bank (BSS) at DC link. The control algorithm operates in standalone mode and grid connected mode. It can switch in islanded and grid connected modes seamlessly according to the wind conditions. In standalone mode, this wind power is fed to the load through a VSI, during low wind conditions, the battery discharges itself to fulfill the load demand. After that, the grid is connected to give power to the load during low wind conditions, and for this, control algorithm operates in grid connected mode. Therefore, the control algorithm switches from voltage control to current control mode to provide smooth synchronization and vise versa at de-synchronization.

The segmentation of MR images of the neonatal brain is a fundamental step in the study and assessment of infant brain development. The highest level of development techniques for adult brain MRI segmentation are not suitable for neonatal brain, because of substantial contrasts in structure and tissue properties between newborn and fully developed brains. Current newborn brain MRI segmentation techniques either depend on manual interaction or require the utilization of atlases or templates, which unavoidably presents a bias of the results towards the population that was utilized to derive the atlases.

Contingency analysis is one of the best methods to forecast the condition of power system if any unwanted event occured in the power system. To do contingency analysis first the operator has to know the parameters like voltage, power and voltage angle at each and every bus by doing load flow analysis on the system. Newton Raphson method is the best load flow method as it gives accurate results in less time. In this paper all line outage contingencies in a standard 6 bus and 5 bus power system has been done in MATLAB environment. For each line outage contingency, load flow analysis has been done on the system and the active power and voltage performance indices have been calculated. These two performance indices will give the idea about the change in active power flow through the lines and voltages at the buses for a particular line outage. Summation of these two indices will give the performance index value through which ranking of severity will be given to the lines. And from the load flow results comparison has been done between low rank and high rank line outage contingencies. This contingency analysis helps the operational engineer to know which line outage is dangerous to the system and what prior action is to be taken to minimize the effect of that particular line outage. © 2016 IEEE.","Contingency Selection; Line Outage; Newton Raphson Method; Overload; Performance Indices","Electric load flow; Electric power system protection; Intelligent control; Newton-Raphson method; Optimal systems; Power control; Power electronics; Transient analysis; Contingency analysis; Contingency Selection; Line outage; Line outage contingencies; Overload; Performance indices; Power system protection; Voltage performance indices; Outages",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The values so obtained produces perfect harmonic cancellation (PHC) and unity power factor (UPF) for balanced and sinusoidal supply voltages based photovoltaic fed DSTATCOM (PV-DSTATCOM). However when supply voltages are distorted; PV-DSTATCOM may not produce PHC along with UPF due to non-linear behavior of the passive filter parameters. Hence; there should be an optimal calculation for filter parameters and PI controller gains; so that the PV-DSTATCOM can deliver optimal performance under distorted supply voltages. This paper presents a new algorithm based on teaching-learning behavior inside a classroom; to optimize the gains of PI controller and filter parameters. Through simulation results; it is observed that the optimization based control algorithm performs quite satisfactorily under sinusoidal as well as distorted supply voltage conditions.

Due to the environmental impact of SF6 gas, strict regulations have been laid to monitor their use and to restrict their emission from switchgears. Quartz based resonant density sensor is the best technology commercially available today for SF6 monitoring. Frequency response of the sensor is a function of both density and viscosity. However, each sensor contains a matched pair of quartz crystals for temperature compensation. The accuracy of the density sensor is limited by the extent of mismatch between the quartz crystals which determines the minimum detectable change in SF6 density. Calibration makes the sensor gas-specific and dependent on the environmental conditions.

But the conversion efficiency of a normal PV cell is low. One of the main reason for this is that the output of PV cell is dependent directly on the light intensity and with the position of the sun in the sky changing continuously from time to time; the absorption efficiency of an immobile solar panel would be significantly less at certain time of the day and year; for the solar photovoltaic cells are maximum productive when they are perpendicular to the sun and less productive otherwise. So to maximize the energy generation and improve the efficiency; solar trackers come into play. This paper presents the design and construction of an inexpensive active dual-axis solar tracking system for tracking the movement of the sun so as to get maximum power from the solar panels as they follow the sun. It uses Light Dependent Resistors to sense the position of the sun which is communicated to a Arduino Uno microcontroller which then commands a set of two servo-motors to re-orient the panel in order to stay perpendicular to the sun rays. The design was constructed successfully and tested using Lab View to determine the improvements in efficiency. Evaluation results show that the new system performs 13.44% better than the immobile solar PV system. © 2016 IEEE.","Dual-axis Tracker Arduino; Light Dependent Resistors; PV Panel","Cells; Cytology; Intelligent control; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photoresistors; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Power control; Power electronics; Resistors; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Absorption efficiency; Design and construction; Dual axis; Evaluation results; Light dependent resistor; PV panel; Solar photovoltaics; Solar tracking systems; Solar power generation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These sensors are deployed to accomplish various tasks e.g. to measure the environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity, pollution level of sea water; to monitor some ongoing activities such as surveillance, tracking of suspects; and etc. Also their batteries don't last very long since it requires continues transmission of data towards the user/customer/sink. Our main goal here is how to provide simple and effective approach to provide hybrid data compression (spatial and temporal both) in the wireless sensor network in order to improve energy efficiency of the network. WSNs are deployed in great amount over the detected environment and it has been observed that the data from neighboring sensors usually have large correlation so sometimes it is waste of energy for the transmission of this duplicate information from neighboring sensors rather we can exploit this spatial correlation to reduce the heavy burden of data in transmission. Besides it has been seen that on a particular sensor, their readings are also correlated for a limited duration so we can exploit this temporal correlation to reduce the amount of data. Our scheme is not suitable to real time data monitoring rather it is quite better for delay tolerant services as it requires a little time for processing of data before transmitting it to the sink. Neighboring correlated sensors forms a cluster and their data are collectively stored in two dimensional Matrix and afterwards, Compression techniques are applied in both domain (Space and Time). That's why it is termed as Hybrid Compression. After applying these compression methods the data are transmitted towards the sink. Our result shows that our proposed scheme gives satisfactory approximation of received data at the sink. © 2016 IEEE.","Auto Regressive Moving Average; Principal Component Analysis; Wireless Sensor Network","Data compression; Data handling; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Principal component analysis; Seawater; Water pollution; Autoregressive moving average; Compression techniques; Effective approaches; Energy efficient wireless sensor networks; Environmental attributes; Real-time data monitoring; Temporal correlations; Transmission of data; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

For its implementation, a least complex grid synchronization approach was used for the generation of parallel and orthogonal components of the grid voltage in an efficient manner using various computing techniques to generate a synchronized current reference value in the current control loop. An improved H6 single-phase inverter topology ensures the elimination of the common-mode leakage current in the transformer-less photovoltaic grid-connected system. In addition this topology is also capable of withstanding the low input voltage similar to full-bridge inverter without causing any fault. The H6 inverter topology allows both unipolar Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SINUSOIDAL PWM) as well as the bipolar (i.e. double frequency) SINUSOIDAL PWM control techniques for three-level output. Two additional switches are decoupled on the dc side for higher efficiency and convenient thermal design.

Since drug infusion is interacting type and sensitivity to drugs differs from patient to patient; so the appropriate controller design is challenging task. Therefore suitable controller is required to improve the patient care and also to minimize clinical expenses. Firstly; for tuning of PID controller gains conventional Ziegler Nichols (ZN) method is used. Later PID gains are optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with aggregation of Settling Time; Overshoot and Integral Square Error (ISE) as an objective function.

In this paper, a super capacitor is used as a power source for a boost converter to yield a constant output voltage for a current in the range of milliamps. Depending upon the output current draw the super capacitor voltage decays and we will to simulate this decay characteristic using dc-dc converter. In this paper firstly we discuss the methodology for designing PWM based constant output dc-dc boost converter powered by super capacitor i.e. the input voltage is varying and based on it we endeavor create the methodology for a test circuit which when connected to any circuit in place of super capacitor, will yield the almost same effect.

There are several basic experiments in physics which help the students understand the basics of classical physics. However, the rising cost of laboratory infrastructure and costly equipment to conduct these experiments make it difficult for schools, in developing countries like India to build laboratories. This paper presents innovative web-based laboratory for physics to study equations of motion. One such experiment in equations of motion is the determination of acceleration due to gravity of a free falling object. However, measuring the distance traveled and time taken by a free-falling object is a tedious process. To overcome this challenge, a computer vision based system is presented which can measure the distance traveled and time taken by the object during free fall. By the technique of object detection in computer vision, the free-falling object is detected and tracked. The system is implemented using OpenCV libraries.

In this manuscript, a comparative study of different pattern recognition techniques using wavelet based features for islanding detection in distributed generation is presented. A system containing two DGs, one synchronous wind generator and an asynchronous hydro generator are taken into consideration. The model is simulated and wavelet transform is applied to extract the features like energy, entropy and standard deviation. Pattern recognition techniques including decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) and differential evolution (DE)-clustering are applied to segregate the islanding condition from non-islanding events like single line to ground fault, double line to ground fault, triple line to ground fault, load switching, capacitive switching, voltage sag, voltage swell and DG tripping. The comparative results show the effectiveness of each individual classifier for islanding detection in both noiseless and noisy environments.

Shunt active power filters (SAPF) are broadly implemented in power systems for mitigating the harmonic current component as well as to recompense imaginary or reactive power owing to their exact and reckless operation. The objective of this paper is to improve power quality through mitigating harmonics. This paper focuses on sinusoidal current based controller used in a shunt active power filter system (SAPF). Sinusoidal current control strategy is used to extract alternating (sinusoid) current commencing the source. The sinusoidal Currents, in addition with a stout synchronizing circuit (PLL circuit), custom a brief controller meant for shunt active filter. Power filter offers current compensation in such a manner that the shunt current drained from the system is sinusoidal and stable, analogous in the direction of the positive-sequence constituent of load current. SAPF is precise by a sinusoidal current control based controller in order to perform like a harmonic isolator among supply and load. Action of the shunt active filter under passive load conditions using non-linear load, the performance of the sinusoidal current control technique is evaluated using MATLAB R2015a.

So there arises a need to find new energy resources which are in bulk and also does not affect the environment. Solar is one of the best solution among all the renewable source of energy available today. Nowadays photovoltaic (PV) system are mostly recognized and widely used for different types of power system applications. Solar panels convert solar energy into electricity, if DC load is there it can be fed directly by panel through DC-DC converter and if alternating current (AC) load is there, which is mostly in residential and industrial applications, inverter is connected to DC-DC converter. As demand has rise maximum utilization of power is also a major concern, the power generated by solar should be fully utilized for the extra power generated is fed to grid by synchronizing solar inverter with grid.

Oversizing leads to a decrease in operating efficiency & performance of the motor, and hence there is an opportunity for energy saving. Considering this fact, this paper proposes an Energy model and shaft torque estimation method for in-service Induction motor, with a mathematical formulation. The methodology for shaft torque estimation involves conducting No-load test and measurement of stator resistance, the tests can be conducted with minimal process disruption during regular maintenance shutdowns in the industry. Once these offline tests are completed, the operating efficiency and load can be estimated at any speed and shaft load when the machine is online, with minimal input parameters like RMS voltage, Line current and power factor, which are available on the Motor Control Centers (MCC). The shaft torque equations are validated on laboratory experimental setups, the experimental values are compared with the estimated value, and the results are presented.

One such domain is to find a path in an unknown and hostile environment to reach the goal. Due to the complexity of many tasks in this domain itis difficult for the robots (agents) to solve this with pre-programmed agent behaviors. Instead of using pre-programmed agent behaviors agents must discover a solution on their own by using learning. In simple reinforcement learning algorithms, a single agent learns how to achieve a goal through many episodes. But if complexity of learning problem is increased or the number of agents is more, it may lead to take more computation time in order to obtain the optimal policy and sometimes it may be the situation that it may not reach to the goal. For optimization problems, bio inspired multi-agent search methods such as particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization have been recognized to obtain a global optimal solution for multi-modal functions with wide solution space rapidly. This paper proposes a SARSA based reinforcement learning algorithm using one agent and two agents where the agents are guided by the pheromone levels also called the Phe-SARSA. In this algorithm agents learn through not only their respective experiences but also with the help of pheromone trail left by other agents to search for the shortest path.

The objective of feeder reconfiguration is to find the best possible radial network configuration in terms of minimum power loss. Feeder reconfiguration is the process of changing the topology of the network by changing the on/off status of both the tie as well as sectionalizing switches. PSO can be used as one of the approaches for finding the best optimal reconfigured system. But the basic PSO is designed for optimization of continuous function and reconfiguration is a problem of discrete and combinational optimization. Hence, the basic PSO is modified in this paper to fit into the problem statement. A shift operator has been incorporated in the velocity equation that changes the position of tie switches after each iteration such that the algorithm moves into the direction of finding the optimum result. The paper emphasizes the significance of voltage dependence of load on the reconfiguration studies.

RMS error performances for position and velocity estimation using both Uniform Motion (UM) model and Coordinated Turn (CT) model have been evaluated for standard, Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters. The study justifies the expectation that the higher order (but nonlinear) CT model would outperform the simpler, linear lower ordered UM model and quantifies the quantitative improvement in RMS error for various values of Q. It has been further demonstrated that by appropriate choice of Q, RMS error can be reduced substantially for both the models.

This technologies help to meet peak electrical load demands by providing time varying energy management. Therefore, it can be suitably utilized to solve reactive power dispatch (RPD) problems. The RPD's are frequently associated with real power loss minimizations with dynamic voltage stability issues. The proposed RPD problems are commonly tackled by capacitor placements. Due to its static behavior, the capacitors are unable to provide desired results every time. In this context, SMES can generate the desired solutions. However, the SMES have also limited applications due to their higher installation and operating costs. Now, if the hybridized compensators involving capacitor and SMES are optimally chosen, the cost of operation reduces. In this work, hybrid capacitor-SMES based var compensation is utilized to solve the RPD problem. The sitting and sizing of the compensators are assigned by the Cuckoo Search Algorithm. The CSA based results showed the hybrid capacitor-SMES provided minimum 6.85 % power loss reduction w.r.t other meta-heuristics techniques.

The system control is such that it avoids battery overcharging or deep discharging by maintaining the battery SOC levels. This is facilitated by the Desired Power Control (DPC) of system algorithm which tracks the PV power according to the load requirements. Major drawback of control of the standalone system is management of excess PV power which is solved by using DPC without the use of dump loads which are difficult to manage. The control of the DC-DC converters is done analytically for accurate tracking the changing references according to the prevailing conditions. The ac voltage regulation of the inverter is enhanced by using the abc-dq transformation and its control is also done analytically.

The method uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM) neural network in conjunction with determinant function for classification and location of faults. In this technique current, voltage and power phasor values are measured for half cycle duration from fault inception at the relaying end of the faulted transmission line. The determinant function is used to extract fault features. Optimal fault feature set is selected using sequential forward selection (SFS) method. The selected features are fed as input to OSELM for fault classification and fault location estimation.

The proposed MRAS is developed by using instantaneous and steady state values of a fictitious resistance (R) in the reference and adaptive models respectively. The optimization scheme generates the optimal level of rotor flux for machine operation and improves the efficiency of the drive system by bringing down the IM core loss. The developed overall scheme is immune to the stator resistance variation. Moreover, the unique formation of the MRAS eliminates completely the requirement of any flux estimation.

A simple and efficient method for the automatic segmentation of clinical images using colorspace analysis and improved binary thresholding algorithm is proposed.

The proposed algorithm corrects these constraints with initial pre-processing steps of adjustments of clinical image.

A methodology to arrive at the motor and battery specifications of a typical three-wheeler EV for the selected drive cycle is given for the cases of direct drive and geared drive.

In order to repress this problem; usually a power system stabilizer is used. Performance of Conventional Power System Stabilizer (CPSS) will degrade due to any deviation from its quiescent operating state. Variations in system inertia constant; significantly play a role in causing the low frequency oscillations; which in turn affect the power system frequency. The inertia constant also affects the manner in which a disturbed system regains its steady state. So a robust PSS is required to achieve a good frequency stability for single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system; which can attain robustness against variations in inertia constant. This paper elucidates the; H∞ loop shaping method to design a PSS for a simplified Heffron-Phillips model of SMIB system. Designed robust PSS ensures the robustness of the system against parameter variation in inertia constant. It also ensures the stability and has superior oscillation damping capacity against system inertia constant. © 2016 IEEE.","H∞ Synthesis; Inertia Constant; Loop Shaping; Power System Stabilizer; Robust Power System Stabilizer; Single Machine Infinite Bus","Design; Energy transfer; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Robustness (control systems); Scheduling algorithms; Inertia constants; Loop-shaping; Power System Stabilizer; Robust power systems; Single machine infinite bus; System stability",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Traditional controllers exhibit innate performance deficiencies in the widely varying aerodynamic scenario with substantially elevated control efforts. Therefore nonlinear optimality based control would be vital for the overall system performance. The prime feature of Inverse Optimal Control is that it guarantees asymptotic stability and optimality, globally, with respect to a performance index determined posteriori. The basis of Inverse Optimal control (IOC) rests on the formulation of an appropriate Control Lyapunov Function (CLF), the determination of which is in fact laborious in most cases. However here, the determination of CLF, for a particular class of nonlinear systems, is systematized to some extent. The 6 DOF aircraft dynamics separated into two timescales is considered for simulation study. The slow angular dynamics of the outer loop is controlled via Inverse Optimal Control. A suboptimal Theta-D controller is employed for the control of the fast inner loop. Thus in effect a near optimal control performance is expected of the resultant nonlinear control system. The inherent stability and robustness characteristic of the participating control laws will contribute the same to the overall system. Simulation results verify all the anticipated capabilities in terms of performance, optimality, stability and robustness. © 2016 IEEE.","Control Lyapunov Function; Inverse Optimal Control; Optimal Control; Robustness; Stability; Theta-D","Asymptotic stability; Control theory; Convergence of numerical methods; Couplings; Fighter aircraft; Flight control systems; Intelligent control; Lyapunov functions; Lyapunov methods; Nonlinear control systems; Power control; Power electronics; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Stability; Control Lyapunov function; Inverse-optimal control; Near-optimal control; Nonlinear flight controls; Optimal controls; Performance indices; Simulation studies; Stability and robustness; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Gamma Normalization helps to enhance the image which gives better detail of the image. Then the segmentation is performed on the Gamma Normalized image. Segmentation is done by Superpixel method. Superpixel is the group of pixel into different regions which is based on compactness and regional size. Adaptive SLIC has been used for superpixalation. Adaptive SLIC is the algorithm for Superpixel generation which is use to set parameter adaptively for each Superpixel.

They inject harmonics to the system and the normal delta-star distribution transformer traps the injected triple-n harmonics in the primary delta winding. This leads to the deterioration and reduction in the life of transformer. Hence, a three winding star-star-delta-utilized transformer is used to trap this harmonic or drainage power in the non-linear power system. This drainage power can be used to power auxiliary loads connected across the tertiary delta winding. Also, drainage power recovery makes the system performance better as triple-n harmonics are eliminated from supply line. For balanced and unbalanced secondary non-linear loads, the tertiary power can be recovered. Also, it can be stored in rechargeable batteries to power regulated loads. In this paper, the use of battery stored drainage power for the voltage regulation in shunt active filters is being discussed. The shunt active filter using Icosφ algorithm provides better harmonic elimination of non-linear load. When a load fluctuation occurs, the dc link capacitor voltage in the filter also fluctuates. Usually, the power needed for voltage regulation is supplied by the grid. In the proposed system, the drainage power stored in the battery is used for the voltage regulation. For using shunt active filter in the YYD-utilized transformer system, the control algorithm of the filter needs to be modified in order to sustain the triple-n harmonics in the system. The power recovered from triple-n harmonics can be stored in a battery and can be further used as the energy storage element of the filter. Results analyzed using MATLAB/SIMULINK reveals that the YYD-utilized system along with shunt active filter gives better utilization of drainage power and the overall system provides harmonic elimination. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery Stored Drainage Power; Modified Icos Algorithm; Shunt Active Filter (SAF); Star-star-delta-utilized Transformer (YYD-utilized Transformer)","Bandpass filters; DC transformers; Electric batteries; Electric transformers; Harmonic analysis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Recovery; Secondary batteries; Stars; Voltage regulators; Winding; Battery Stored Drainage Power; DC link voltage regulation; Dc-link capacitor voltages; Distribution transformer; Harmonic elimination; Primary delta winding; Shunt active filters; Star delta; Active filters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

ZigBee has been identified earlier as the one of the most suitable wireless technology for Home Area Networks (HAN) of smart grid. Mesh network topology provides the secure and reliable means of data transmission in case of ZigBee network to be implemented in smart grid. In this work, a smart grid network has been designed to be developed in Jadavpur University Saltlake Campus, Kolkata (22.5733°N, 88.4137°E). The wireless sensor nodes have been identified in different areas of the campus and the load of different buildings has been monitored. Solar and wind power system controlled by WSN technologies has been also installed to meet the excess load demands. A central control station will monitor the load distribution throughout the campus and hence will make load leveling possible. Optimum numbers of wireless nodes have been planned to ensure that all the buildings are covered along with continuous and reliable data delivery to the control station.

The proposed SPV system is able to handle the unpredictability of solar PV insolations and nonlinear loads at PCC (Point of Common). In its first stage, a DC-DC boost converter is used for extracting the maximum energy from the solar PV array. The boost converter is controlled by utilizing INC (Incremental Conductance) based MPPT control technique. In second stage, grid tied VSC (Voltage Source Converter) is controlled through the windowing factor based control algorithm. For an improved steady state and dynamic responses, a window based transfer function is utilized in the proposed control algorithm. Besides controlling the VSC, window functions are tuned to mitigate the certain level of harmonics current.

The Training efficiency of both the algorithms is compared at the end of implementation. Logistic Regression is generally used for binary classification however; multiclass classification has been achieved by using One-vs-All approach. Artificial neural networks are used for feed forward propagation to build the hypothesis function and back propagation is used for calculation of weights. The weights for both the models are minimized using advanced optimization algorithm such as fmiunc and fmincg. The formulas are implemented in vectorized format that is the formulas are solely expressed in matrix form and nowhere for loops are required. Vectorization does involve a lot of formulations to be done on paper beforehand but it ultimately serves the optimization purpose because higher programming languages such as MATLAB are very efficient to implement vectorized codes and this property should be exploited.

This paper presents a comparative study between conventional DTC and finite control set model predictive direct torque control (FCS-MPDTC) for an induction motor drive. The conventional DTC offers fast dynamic response, however the presence of nonlinear controllers causes considerable torque and flux ripples. In this paper, a simple one step ahead FCS-MPDTC is used by considering stator flux and rotor flux as state variables. In this method, nonlinear controllers and heuristic switching table are replaced with a cost function based online optimization for the selection of suitable switching state. Further, a new cost function is introduced based on simple weighted sum method to eliminate the selection of weighting factors.

Many TFC have been proposed by the researchers out of which 7555 timer based SCC has been employed in several applications. The application of 7555 timer based SCC demands a method for generating the optimal circuit parameters yielding desired linearity and sensitivity for a given input temperature range. Two classical methods, namely, inflection point and three point methods have been employed by several researchers for this task. These classical methods, being simple in nature, offer moderate linearity and the residual non-linearity is normally further improved with the help of other supporting methods like software based techniques. In the present work, a linear numerical search based scheme is proposed to enhance the linearization capability of 7555 timer based SCC in TFC. The enhancement is attained by just selecting the appropriate value of a resistor in SCC application. The proposed method has been investigated in simulation on three different industrial grade thermistors for the input temperature range of 0°C-100°C for 7555 based SCC. An enhancement of linearity performances of 4.9%, 4.7% and 4.7% have been obtained over the three point method and 21.7%, 18.3% and 17.8% over the inflection point method for thermistor 1, thermistor 2 and thermistor 3, respectively. Based on these data it can be concluded that linear numerical search a promising solution for linearity enhancement of thermistors in 7555 SCC.

Apart from the conventional and non-conventional methods of generating power, researchers are finding other ways of utilizing the energy that is wasted in the environment in form of vibrations, pressure, heat, sound, etc. Thus, Energy harvesting from the environment comes out as a clean and sustainable way to power these devices. In this paper an attractive approach is proposed to harvest energy from human shoes particularly Soldier's shoe. A soldier carries numerous electronic gadgets for his mission which needs uninterrupted power supply. An alternative way is proposed here to power the Soldier's Electronic System or to recharge his batteries. This approach is implemented with the help of piezoelectric materials. The idea is to incorporate piezo polymers i.e. PVDF stacks beneath the heels of their shoes and generate electrical power merely by walking/running. This approach generates clean & green power which can even be stored for future use in absence of load. DC-DC converters were employed to maximize the electrical power from the material, to store it in a Super capacitor & to enhance the efficiency of the system. This power can be later utilized to power the soldier's electronics gadgets or and can also power a passive RF tag system for tracking soldier's in remote areas. © 2016 IEEE.","Buck-boost Converter; DSSH; Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Piezogenerator; PVDF","Crystallography; Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Energy harvesting; Intelligent control; Piezoelectricity; Power control; Power electronics; Sustainable development; Buck boost converter; DSSH; Low-powered devices; Non-conventional methods; Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Piezogenerator; PVDF; Uninterrupted power supply; DC-DC converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Despite of being robust in nature, it is subjected to various faults categorized as mechanical and electrical faults. A large extant of mechanical faults is due to the bearings which makes identification of malfunctions in nascent condition, a research area of higher importance. Motor Current Signature Analysis emerges as a valuable tool for the purpose. Further, for the purpose of signature extraction, Wavelet Transform also gained importance as a signal processing technique due to its well known property of Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA). It prevails over the major snag of frequency domain technique that is resolution problem. In this paper, stator current signal at no load condition is used for the purpose of fault diagnosis. Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is used as signal processing tool and artificially created signals are used to test formula while a set of damaged bearings is used to get the required data of fault conditions for testing the proposed methodology practically. Proposed analysis helps to identify the frequency band along with the axis of operation which can be under focus for the purpose of bearing fault detection.

PPG is a noninvasive circulatory signal related to the pulsatile volume in tissue according to the variation of the blood pumped by the heart. A PPG is obtained by using a pair of infrared transmitter and receiver. Infrared transmitter emits infrared light which is absorbed by the flowing blood in the finger. This absorbed light is reflected by the finger and detected by the infrared receiver. The signal received is small therefore balanced combination of resistors with capacitors are required for the clean extraction of the signal. The device consists of pair of these detector and receiver coupled with amplifier and filter circuit. The amplifier used here is LM386 operational amplifier. Amplifier is capable of amplifying 1000 times the signal received from the detector. As the signal obtained from the finger is small and weak this kind of amplification is necessary. Due to various stages of signal extraction and amplification unnecessary noise like amplification noise is introduced. To get rid of these noises a low pass RC filter circuit is used. RC filter circuit is tuned at 16 Hz to significantly remove the 16 Hz noise which is most prevalent in these kind of low signal devices. Cost of device is very low and Signal obtained can be used in variety of ways for the diagnosis of heart related diseases. © 2016 IEEE.","Diastolic Peak; Dicrotic Notch; LM386; Photoplethysmogram; Phototransistor; RC Filter; Systolic Peak","Amplification; Blood; Diagnosis; Extraction; Intelligent control; Operational amplifiers; Passive filters; Phototransistors; Power control; Power electronics; Signal detection; Transmitters; Diastolic Peak; Dicrotic notch; LM386; Photo-plethysmogram; RC filter; Systolic Peak; Biomedical signal processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

For linear time invariant processes, conventional PID controller is suitable but they have limitations when they are required to control the plants having high non linearity or their parameters are changing with the time. In order to find the parameters of PID controller, information regarding the dynamics of the plant is essential. If perturbation occurs in plant parameter(s) then PID controller may work only if these changes are not severe. But most plants are either non linear or their parameters changes with time and this demands for a use of more robust type of controller and ANN is a suitable candidate. To use the power of PID controller and ANN, ANN based PID controller is proposed in this paper. The benefit of this combination is that it utilizes the simplicity of PID controller mathematical formula and uses the ANN powerful capability to handle parameter variations and non linearity. © 2016 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; Back Propagation Algorithm; Discrete Time Systems; Dynamical Systems; Gradient Descent; Online Control; Parameter Perturbation; Proportional Integral Derivative Controller","Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Controllers; Deep neural networks; Digital control systems; Discrete time control systems; Dynamical systems; Electric control equipment; Intelligent control; Linear control systems; Neural networks; Online systems; Power control; Power electronics; Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Discrete - time systems; Gradient descent; On-line controls; Parameter perturbation; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Adaptive control systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These distributed resources are owned by different organizations. Grid computing provides a framework for parallel/distributed computing. For developing a grid, low-level services (secure access management of resources) and high-level services (application development and scheduling) should be developed. Dynamic nature of resources in grid architecture is the reason for varied load on resources. So for better management of resources, the scheduling concept comes into account. Scheduling means order of jobs which satisfy the metrics like user's satisfaction and completion time & so on. Better scheduling policy in grid computing improves performance, cost of computation, load balancing and increase reliability and availability of resources. This paper presents various approaches for allocation of resources in grid computing environment.

NFTSM uses a nonlinear switching function designed with the focus on achieving faster convergence rate of the system states towards stable equilibrium points without any singularity problems. Further, a dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC) has also been derived which is based on additional dynamics added to the switching surface. DSMC has relatively slow asymptotic convergence rate but shows good transient performance and hence helps in appreciating the performance of NFTSM in a better way. Performance of both these controllers have been compared with the results of already established non-singular terminal sliding mode control (NTSM) method. Simulation results are shown at the end to prove the efficiency of the methods discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Chaotic Systems; Dynamic Switching; Nonsingular Terminal Sliding; Sliding Mode Control","Chaotic systems; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Asymptotic convergence rate; Dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC); Dynamic switching; Fast terminal sliding mode controls; Non-singular terminal sliding mode controls; Nonsingular; Parametric uncertainties; Stable equilibrium points; Sliding mode control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In this paper, AI based Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is used to evolve half-hourly load forecasting model for a period of three days. This model is tested and validated on five Australian states' load data. Out of these five cases, forecasting accuracy in four cases is confined to 2.7233%; amongst these four cases two show the forecasting error less than 2%. In one case forecasting error is 6.4593%, which is acceptable because the state consumes lesser energy.

Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants. Accordingly, accurate forecasting of price is an important exercise to hedge against volatility. This paper proposes a hybrid technique comprising singular spectrum analysis and neural network incorporating temperature and load data for forecasting in day ahead electricity market. The results obtained with this hybrid technique are found to be more accurate when compared to existing methods described in literature. © 2016 IEEE.","Electricity price forecasting; neural network; real time forecast; singular spectrum analysis","Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Intelligent control; Losses; Neural networks; Plasma diagnostics; Power control; Power electronics; Spectrum analysis; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Exogenous variables; Market Clearing Price; Market participants; Real-time forecasts; Singular spectrum analysis; Surrounding temperature; Power markets",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The proposed method considers the variation in load levels and hence aims to minimize energy losses in the system by placement of DG. For maximum energy loss saving, the sizing of DG units is obtained by classical optimization technique. The developed method needs the solution of base case load flow only for execution.

It further contains comparison between grid side conventional controller and TS fuzzy controller along with design of LCL filter. Control of the inverter has been done by Synchronous reference frame (SRF) scheme. The objective behind the grid side converter control is to evacuate the active power and reactive power from WSES. In case load requirement exceeds wind energy generation, the control architecture will ensure that remaining demand will meet through grid supply. Reactive power compensation of the load is done through the control algorithm. Working of proposed system is investigated under nonlinear, unbalance, varying load and with change in wind speed. Grid code compliances were considered to verify the effectiveness of proposed system. Simulation is performed using MATLAB/Simulink platform. © 2016 IEEE.","LCL Filter; Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT); TS Fuzzy Controller; Voltage Source Converter (VSC); Wind Energy System (WES)","Compliance control; Controllers; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Fuzzy filters; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Power control; Power converters; Power electronics; Reactive power; Synchronous generators; Wind; Wind power; LCL filters; Maximum Power Point Tracking; T-S fuzzy controllers; Voltage source converters; Wind energy systems; Electric power system control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Motor current signature extraction based analogies, plays an important role in detection and identification of factors causing imperfections in Induction Motors. Signature Extraction using Wavelet Transform with the property of Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) can be seen as a reliable tool, as it deals effectively with the problem of resolution. Transient time current during motor build up has an advantage that loading does not affect the amplitude of the start-up transient, hence processes based on start-up transient current enjoys benefits of no proposed based on signal energy by processing the transient time current data using Wavelet Packet Technique (WPT).For uniform scaled analysis of motor conditions, probability of %FS is used.

The objective of the proposed work is the minimization of operational cost and maximization of system availability. For feeder reconfiguration purpose the optimal possible connections between the buses are considered to be the design variables and this represents the discrete nature of problem statement. Thus, in the proposed work a bit-relocate-based TLBO algorithm is developed that can handle both continuous as well as discrete nature of the planning problem to find the optimal reconfigured route by satisfying all technical constraints. For reliability purpose a novel reliability indicator called contingency-load-loss-index is used.

This paper took load sharing problem and voltage steady state error (ess) into consideration. Combination of two controllers namely P/V droop controller and Busbar voltage stabilizing controller (BVSC) is explained in autonomous DC microgrid. Using P/V droop controller; efficient load sharing among the converters with respect to their KVA rating is established. This controller however cause droop in voltage level of Busbar. To remove voltage droop due to increased power demand BVSC controller is used which is augmented with PID controller.

Hence, a suitable communication protocol and a well-defined architecture, which would perform satisfactorily in a harsh electrical environment is a must. CAN (Controller Area Network) due to its versatile features like robust error handling, high frame rate, collision free arbitration, broadcasting, differential signal transfer etc. provides an apt option to the need. To validate the CAN communication algorithm, a prototype CAN bus along with CAN nodes, for a DC microgrid that is fed by solar Photo-Voltaic (PV), battery and Fuel Cell (FC) through boost type dc-dc converters is designed and developed. A novel load shedding algorithm using CAN has been designed for the developed system.

Additionally, three-phase, four-wire distribution systems faces poor power quality problems such as unbalanced loading, excessive neutral current and voltage distortion due to current harmonics. In order to keep the voltage within a limit and mitigate such power quality problems, reactive power compensation devices such as distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) are used as custom power devices which help in increasing the operational efficiency and reliability of power distribution systems. In a D-STATCOM, generally, the DC link capacitor voltage is regulated using a proportional integral (PI) controller along with various control algorithms used for load compensation. However, during load changes, there is considerable variation in DC link capacitor voltage which might affect compensation. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based supervisory method is presented to improve transient performance of the DC link. A mamdani fuzzy logic based controller is designed in such a way that the gains generated by the fuzzy supervisor are added to the reference proportional and integral gains of the PI controller which helps to maintain the DC Link voltage. A MATLAB/Simulink model for the system with a resistive inductive (R-L) load is developed using SimPower Toolbox. It is observed that the fuzzy logic supervised D-STATCOM successfully compensates for the reactive power required by the load. A transient (load throw off condition) is created by removing one of the phases of the load for a short duration. The DC link capacitor voltage is observed and compared to a case when only a conventional PI controller is used with no fuzzy supervision. It is observed that the proposed controller has a better performance than the conventional one in terms of better voltage regulation and faster settling time. © 2016 IEEE.","D-STATCOM; DC Link; Fuzzy Logic; PCC; Voltage Regulation","Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric current regulators; Electric power utilization; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Quality control; Reactive power; Static synchronous compensators; Two term control systems; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Voltage regulators; DC links; Dc-link capacitor voltages; DSTATCOM; Four-wire distribution systems; Fuzzy logic based controller; Proportional integral controllers; Reactive power compensation; Reactive power compensation device; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The stabilization of the line of sight (LOS) against vehicle-induced disturbances is an essential feature of the electro-optical gimbaled sighting systems, mounted on mobile platforms. Due to factors like host platform dynamics, friction, cable restraint and noise, the pointing and tracking accuracy of the gimbaled system degrades substantially. This work presents control law design for LOS stabilization of a gimbaled electro-optical sighting system, using sliding mode controller (SMC). Other controllers like proportional-integral (PI) controller (conventional frequency domain approach) and linear quadratic gaussian with loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) controller (state-space based optimal control) are also compared with SMC for such application. SMC is a non-linear controller that is modified in this work which further reduces the chatter so as to achieve better steady state accuracy.

Here, super pixel segmentation based a new method is discussed to resolve such mixed, lost, and noise level increase of pixel problems of the RGB-D system and has been simulated using MATLAB software. The advantage of MATLAB is, it is widely available, continuously updated and has wider reach. In our approach, mixed pixel areas are detected using super pixel segmentation of colour and depth, and consolidate them to lost pixel regions. The consolidated regions are replete with neighbouring depth information based on a Robust Edge-Stop (RES) Function; distance transform values of colour edge pixels are used to form this function. In addition, a hybrid filter is used to remove noise level of pixels.

Three rotating wind guide vanes/flaps of concave shape are placed on the outer periphery of the turbine. Venturi effect is produced by dynamically changing the angles of the flaps by closed loop control. The vanes protect the turbine from high velocity winds & increase its performance under low velocity winds. There are two modes of guide vanes operation. In the first mode, all the vanes are synchronized and angle of guide vanes is same for all. In the second mode, an additional sensor reads direction of wind and accordingly the system aligns guide vanes individually. A microcontroller based hardware prototype of the turbine has been fabricated and tested for different conditions. The magnetic suspension results in reduced frictional losses. The results obtained validate the advantages of the fabricated turbine as compared to other configurations. © 2016 IEEE.","Guide Vanes; Magnetic Levitation; VAWT; Venturi Effect","Intelligent control; Magnetic levitation; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Power control; Power electronics; Suspensions (components); Wind; Wind effects; Wind turbines; Closed-loop control; Guide vane; Hardware prototype; Magnetic suspension; Microcontroller-based; VAWT; Venturi; Vertical axis wind turbines; Turbine components",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

A discrete time model of the inverter, filter and the load is used by the controller to predict the behavior of the output voltage for each possible switching state. A MPC is an optimization process that uses a cost function to minimize the error between the measured output voltage and the reference voltage. Switching state of the voltage vector that gives the minimum error is selected and given to the inverter during the next sampling instant. The proposed predictive control method performance for LIM at various sampling frequencies is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink tools for Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) analysis. © 2016 IEEE.","Linear Induction Motor (LIM); Model Predictive Control (MPC); Rotary Induction Motor (RIM); Switching Frequency; Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)","Cost functions; Electric inverters; Harmonic distortion; Induction motors; Intelligent control; Linear motors; MATLAB; Power control; Power electronics; Predictive control systems; Switching frequency; Wave filters; Discrete-time model; Linear induction motors; Predictive control methods; Rotary Induction Motor (RIM); Rotating reference frame; Sampling frequencies; Three-phase inverter; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Model predictive control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

It is known that the optimal size and optimal placement of DG units may lead to low power losses, high voltage profiles. In real time scenario identifying an appropriate DG location and size is hard because of various system constraints. Therefore a method which can identify a optimum DG location and size is necessary. Using the method a power system with an acceptable reliability level and voltage profile can be designed. To serve this purpose in this paper a procedure/method which can calculate the optimum location for DG placement and appropriate DG size has been proposed.

Wheeling prices are supposed to be distributed over transmission users. Allocation of wheeling prices means determination of distribution of wheeling prices among transmission users and this depends upon the contribution of each user in total transmission investment cost. The contribution of transmission user in total transmission cost is decided either by transmission owner or by Regulatory body. In real world scenario, the contribution of producers and customers in cost, may be variable because it depends upon the demand supply relation. This paper presents a new approach of wheeling price allocation among transmission users by applying different level of contribution of each transmission user in total transmission investment. This enables the allocation of wheeling prices for any amount of contribution of generator and load in transmission investment. The proposed approach has been illustrated on Garver's 6-bus test system and IEEE RTS 24-bus system. This has been observed that the perspective presented in this paper is capable of recovering fixed transmission cost for varying amount of contribution of transmission users. © 2016 IEEE.","DC-OPF; GGDF; GLDF; MW-km Method; Postage Stamp Method; Power Flow Tracing; Wheeling Prices","Costs; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Intelligent control; Investments; Light transmission; Power control; Power electronics; DC-OPF; GGDF; GLDF; MW-km Method; Postage stamp methods; Power flow tracing; Wheeling prices; Electric power transmission",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Due to hysteresis characteristics of current transformer primary current cannot be replicated accurately into secondary current. Hysteresis characteristics of CT cause an exciting current which is main source of error. In industrial environment load current contains considerable amount of DC offset current and harmonics. Accuracy of CT is dependent upon residual flux in the core and DC offset. In this software compensation scheme instantaneous values of secondary current are sensed with the current sensor. From this sensed secondary current instantaneous flux is calculated which after inserting flux-exciting current loop gives calculated exciting current. Calculated Exciting current is added to the secondary current which gives more accurate secondary current. Effect of DC offset in the load current is neglected in this scheme but harmonics are considered. A more detailed study of DC offset is in progress in this compensation scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","Current Transformers; Hysteresis","Electric instrument transformers; Electric transformers; Error compensation; Errors; Hysteresis; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Compensation scheme; Error compensation methods; Hysteresis characteristics; Industrial environments; Instantaneous value; Measurement current transformer; Potential transformer; Software compensation; Electric currents",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Unsymmetrical phase currents during shunt reactor energization are analyzed and its effects on protective devices are discussed. High DC offset inrush currents with very high time constant during energization of reactor can cause mal-operation of zero sequence ground relays. High value of DC offset in the current might lead to current transformer saturation. Error in phase difference of the currents of saturated CTs at HV and LV side of shunt reactor leads to spurious trip of differential protection relay.

In this paper an IEEE 30 bus system has been taken into account for maintaining the voltage profile at all the buses using Teaching Learning Based Optimization technique (TLBO) and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA). Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) and Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) are the FACTS devices which are employed for reactive power compensation. Optimal location of STATCOM is taken on the basis of voltage sensitivity indicator dV/dS. The bus which has highest value of voltage sensitivity indicator will be considered as most voltage sensitive bus (weak bus) and STATCOM will be placed at the weak buses. SSSC location will be taken on the basis of reactive power flow through the line and the line with the highest reactive power flow will be considered as the optimal line for placement of SSSC. TLBO and CSA is applied for getting optimal rating of voltage controlling parameters (STATCOM rating; SSSC rating; tap setting; Q-gen rating).

These inertial sensors, however, suffer from errors and noise which need to be calibrated and compensated, respectively. With growing use of low cost MEMS based inertial sensors in autonomous vehicles, it is desired to calibrate these systems online and infield without requiring any external equipment. The in-field calibration schemes are based on the simple principle that the norms of the accelerometer triads equals the magnitude of the Earth's gravity. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization scheme and few of its variants are used for estimating bias, scale and non-orthogonality parameter for an uncalibrated accelerometer. The proposed scheme provides a matrix of unknown parameters which can be fed to obtain calibrated sensor readings.

Undoubtedly, the soft switching reduces the power loss in the Main switch while improving the overall EMI in the converters. This facilitates the increase of switching frequency of converters. This paper highlights a design methodology for the transformer in a fly back converter, which automatically accomplishes the complete soft switching of the main switch. No extra circuit or the control scheme is needed to attain Zero Current Turn On and total Zero Voltage Switching (both during turn ON and Turn OFF) of the Main MOSFET switch. Also, it eliminates the Dissipative snubber which is an essential component in fly back converter. However, this scheme is wholly applicable to fixed Input and constant load applications. Nevertheless, most of the Industry scenarios are similar at low power range of about 50 to 100 watts, because invariably the DC-DC converters are operated from a Power factor correction module (Whose output is fairly regulated to around 400V DC) and the output load is constant. The design concept is demonstrated on a 60 watt fly back converter operating from a 400V DC bus and operated at 100 KHz. © 2016 IEEE.","Complete Energy Transfer; Fly Back Converter; Soft Switching; Transformer Design","DC-DC converters; Design; Electric inverters; Energy transfer; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Switching; Zero current switching; Zero voltage switching; Control schemes; Design concept; Design Methodology; Dissipative snubbers; Flyback converters; MOSFET switches; Power factor corrections; Transformer design; Power converters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Cell shows drastic changes in cell morphology and cell size during directed-migration as well as random migration. While understanding the mechanism through which a cell controls its shape/size can play a significant role in improving our understanding of biological systems, the involvement of multiple length/time scales make the experimental exploration of the mechanism very difficult. In the past few decades, control theoretic approaches/tools have proven to be a great facilitator of study and development of cell biology. In this study, we present a simple spring-bead model of a cell to study it's shape and size dynamics during cell migration. The model incorporates the effect of plasma membrane tension, internal pressure and chemoattractant forces on the cell dynamics. In spite of having a significantly lesser number of model parameters, our model recapitulates many features of a real cell including cell polarization, cell cringing, steering, gradient sensing and directed migration.

Among the renewable energy solutions, solar energy is the very vital source that can be used to generate power. Electricity from the sun can be converted through photovoltaic (PV) module. The efficiency of solar module depends on sun intensity, if the intensity is more then efficiency is more. Since the position of sun continuously changes throughout the day, the intensity of sun rays is not uniform on PV module. So, for getting more sun rays on PV module solar tracker plays a much vital role. A solar tracker is a device for operating a solar photovoltaic panel, especially in solar cell applications and requires high degree of accuracy to ensure that the concentrated sunlight is dedicated precisely on to the power device. This paper describes in detail about the design, development and fabrication of two Prototype Solar Tracking Systems mounted with a single-axis and dual-axis solar tracking controllers to generate 10.3 volts, 1.5 watts capable of charging mobile batteries. The rays from the sun should fall perpendicularly onto the solar panels to maximize the capture of the rays and this is done by pointing the solar panels towards the sun and following its path across the sky. The solar tracking systems - Tilted Single Axis Tracker (TSAT) and Azimuth-Altitude Dual Axis Tracker (AADAT) are designed, implemented and experimentally tested. The design details of TSAT and AADAT are described which detect the sunlight using Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors. The control circuit for the systems is based on Atmega8 Microcontroller which is programmed to detect the sunlight through the LDR sensors and then actuate the DC geared motor using L293D motor driver to position the solar panel where it can receive the maximum sunlight. © 2016 IEEE.","AADAT; Photovoltaic Module; Solar Energy; Solar Tracker; TSAT","Controllers; Electric machine control; Energy policy; Intelligent control; Photoresistors; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power electronics; Solar cell arrays; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Tracking (position); AADAT; Atmega8 microcontrollers; Light dependent resistor; Photovoltaic modules; Solar photovoltaic panels; Solar tracker; Solar-cell applications; TSAT; Solar power generation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Unlike traditional line sensors which work on black surfaces with a white line or vice versa, this sensor is designed to differentiate white line on any coloured surface. Thus this sensor can be implemented in robotics applications or in industries where different section's floors are assigned with different colours and robot navigates using line following. The system was implemented using light emitting diodes, phototransistor and an onboard microcontroller Arduino Mega 2560 which communicates with any navigation control system using serial communication. Moving average filters are implemented per channel to remove the fluctuations in the readings due to vibration of the sensor during locomotion. It then gives the error feedback or the offset of the white line from the centre, to the system that is corrected using Proportional-Integral-Derivative algorithm. It also takes care of non scaled readings of the line sensors due to ambient light by having separate threshold values for individual sensors making each sensor independent. The main aim of this paper is to highlight the use and need of a line following sensor capable of differentiating any background colours with white line and at different light conditions.

Features of the proposed WECS include three concave rotating wind vanes situated at the external periphery of the turbine and a hybrid design of VAWT resulting in optimum tip speed ratio (TSR). Venturi effect is produced by dynamically altering the angles of the flaps by closed loop mechanism. The vanes shield the turbine from high velocity winds & augment its performance in low velocity winds. The proposed FIS approach is to approximate the power curve by using an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system based on Sugeno model that uses the wind speed and Guide Vane's angle as the inputs and the mechanical power as the output. A hardware prototype of the WECS is used for collecting training data for different guide vane's angle and wind speed conditions.

An LFSR requires D flip flops and exclusive OR (XOR) gates for its realization. Four different LFSR architectures based on different types of circuits for D flip flop and XOR gate are put forward. The first architecture uses true-single phase clock (TSPC) D flip-flop and static CMOS XOR gate, the second employs TSPC based D flip-flop and Transmission Gate based XOR gate. The other two architectures use transmission gate based D flip flop and differ in the use XOR gate (static CMOS or transmission gate). The functionality of the proposed architectures is verified through SPICE simulations using 0.18 μm TSMC CMOS technology parameters. The performance of the proposed architectures is compared on the basis of highest frequency and power consumption. It is found that the LFSR employing TSPC based D flip flop are capable of achieving highest operating frequency and satisfy the low-power concern of the VLSI chips. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital; LFSR; Low Power; Subthreshold","Bit error rate; CMOS integrated circuits; Feedback; Flip flop circuits; Integrated circuit design; Intelligent control; Power control; Power electronics; Digital; LFSR; Linear feedback shift registers; Low Power; Operating frequency; Proposed architectures; Subthreshold; Transmission gate; Shift registers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique promises to deliver high data rate with simple receiver structure. It is more spectral efficient and has been recommended to be used by many standards. But it has one major disadvantage of having high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). High PAPR drives the power amplifier in saturation region and causes it to operate in nonlinear region with reduced efficiency. There are several techniques to reduce PAPR of OFDM system. In this paper we have done FPGA implementation of selective mapping method (SLM) for PAPR reduction for 4 QAM baseband signal for 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 number of subcarriers. The result obtained have been compared with PAPR values obtained through mathematical analysis and Matlab simulations and also with original signal. For 1024 number of subcarriers at 10-3 of CCDF value the PAPR value obtained with hardware implementation is 9.8 dB which is 2.8 dB less form the original OFDM signal obtained without applying SLM technique but 0.9 dB higher than the Matlab simulated value. This technique is simple in implementation, utilizes less resources and is effective in PAPR reduction. © 2016 IEEE.","FPGA; OFDM; Peak to Average Power Ratio; Selected Mapping","Digital storage; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency division multiplexing; Hardware; Intelligent control; Mapping; MATLAB; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power amplifiers; Power control; Power electronics; Radio broadcasting; Hardware implementations; Linear power amplifiers; Low-power consumption; Mathematical analysis; Modulation techniques; Peak to average power ratio; Selected mapping; Selective mapping methods; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The body of space systems are subjected to many vibrations and shocks. To make sure their stable operation, these vibrations are monitored continuously at a higher sampling rate which results in large amount of data. The data is transmitted over a wireless network to the ground station. Therefore data compression becomes unavoidable, not only for efficient utilization of transmission bandwidth but also for reduced storage requirements. Even the smallest vibration is critical in space applications. So lossless compression techniques are preferred. In this work, a lossless compression technique is proposed where the input data is split into two sets which helps in attaining data redundancy and then the algorithm is applied. Modified Move to front(MTF) coding is done on this data, where positional values of a dictionary are transmitted instead of the sample value. Run length encoding(RLE) is done on the MTF coded data. Next all the successively repeating number patterns in the data set is recognized and RLE coded.

College of Engineering, Thisayanvilai, India","The output of a photovoltaic panel depends on its position with respect to the sun at any instant of time. To extract the maximum power from the panel, tracking systems are generally used for positioning it at an optimal angle. However, in case of solar farms, where a large number of panels are concentrated in a single area, implementing tracking sensors on each panel is not economical. Further, the maintenance of the same is cumbersome. Under practical conditions, due to external factors such as the temperature, perpendicular positioning of solar panels with respect to the sun may not yield maximum power. This paper presents the design of a control for a solar array using an auxiliary panel for tracking the point of maximum output power, rather than placing the panels perpendicular to the sun. The auxiliary panel tracks the point of maximum power and transmits the co-ordinates to the controller, which in turn moves the array to the appropriate position. This tracking system is automatically switched off during cloudy and rainy periods, when the tracking system does not produce any significant change in the output power. Further, this system eliminates the need for initial calibration as required in existing tracking systems. Experimental results prove that the power consumed by the proposed tracking algorithm is significantly lower than that consumed by conventional trackers. © 2016 IEEE.","Auxiliary Panel; Dual Axis; Solar Tracking","Intelligent control; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power electronics; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Tracking (position); Auxiliary Panel; Dual axis; External factors; Maximum output power; Photovoltaic panels; Solar tracking; Tracking algorithm; Tracking system; Solar cell arrays",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The Net Present Value (NPV) function taken in the objective function is used as an economic indicator which justifies the investment in the micro-grid. The NPV function containing initial investment cost, Energy Management System(EMS) strategic cost, maintenance and operation cost, reliability and credits related to reduction in the environment pollution is then maximized using the mixer integer non linear programming(MINLP) which finally determines the optimum capacity and operational strategy of various DG sources present in the micro-grid. © 2016 IEEE.","Emission; Micro-grid; Operation; Optimization; Planning","Costs; Economics; Energy management; Integer programming; Intelligent control; Investments; Neutron emission; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Planning; Power control; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Different energy sources; Economic considerations; Maintenance and operation; Micro grid; Operation; Operational strategies; Renewable energy source; The net present value (NPV); Energy management systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Capacity factor is a parameter widely used for matching wind turbines with a windy site with its high value desired. A high capacity factor ensures low cost of wind energy conversion system. In addition to this availability factor is another parameter of performance index of a wind turbine. A High value of availability factor indicates that wind turbine is operational most of the time. Availability factor is important because the decision of licensing agencies may depend on it in order to support the operational planning of the utility in the area. For a wind energy site these factors depends on speed ratings of the wind turbine i.e. cut-in speed, rated speed and cut-out speed. But these parameters have different effects on capacity factor and availability factor under different conditions. In this paper an attempt has been made to analyze such effect using fifteen wind turbines. Simulation results using MATLAB coding are found to be effective to propose few recommendations for the selection of wind turbines for variable wind speed zones. © 2016 IEEE.","Availability Factor; Capacity Factor; Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS); Wind Turbines","Energy conversion; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Power control; Power electronics; Speed; Wind; Wind power; Capacity factors; Different effects; High capacity; Licensing agency; Operational planning; Performance analysis; Performance indices; Wind energy conversion system; Wind turbines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Equalizers can be fruitfully utilized to minimize this error. Since the channel condition is always dynamic, the coefficients of the equalizer have to be set in an adaptive manner. This leads to the necessity of using Adaptive Equalizer (AE) in the communication system. Efficient optimization techniques add up an extra dimension to it. In this regard, a novel Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) based Adaptive Equalizer (AE) has been proposed in this paper to minimize the channel errors with minimum number of iterations. The convergence behavior of the adaptive algorithm has been studied to establish the effectiveness of our proposition. Moreover, the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the proposed adaptive equalizer has been studied which shows considerable improvement over the entire range of SNR.

Since PV system provides an unregulated voltage output, it is regulated to a desired voltage level and then given to the charge controller, which distributes the power between battery and load. To extract acme power from PV system, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) scheme is employed. The excess energy left, after meeting the load demand, is stored in the battery. The stored energy is utilized to meet the future load demands, when there is a power deficit from the PV system. Hence power requirement of the load is managed. Also a comparison between the three commonly used MPPT techniques: Perturb & Observe (P&O) algorithm, Incremental Conductance (IC) algorithm and Fractional Open Circuit Voltage (FOCV) algorithms is done and the most suitable technique is employed for the hybrid system.

It was observed that driving harshness has a great impact on the regeneration efficiency during vehicle deceleration. On the other hand, to reduce the trip time as well as to avoid accident, the deceleration duration needs to be kept short. By realizing these conflicting objectives, in the present work an optimal deceleration is find out for a speed change using a genetic algorithm. The concerned multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) was solved based on two approaches: considering a constant deceleration, and variable decelerations during braking. Comparative results of both the approaches are presented for a representative speed change in four driving cycles. Results of both approaches in solving the MOOP including under certain constraints, such as a desired comfort journey and maintaining a safe braking distance, suggest that multiple decelerations should be used during planned braking, where as either a constant or multiple deceleration may be taken during braking for high comfort journey and under emergency braking demand. © 2016 IEEE.","Comfort; Energy; Genetic Algorithm; Multi-objective Optimization; Optimal Deceleration; Regenerative Braking; Trip Time","Braking; Crashworthiness; Deceleration; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent control; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Power control; Power electronics; Vehicles; Comfort; Conflicting objectives; Energy; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Regeneration efficiency; Trip time; Vehicle deceleration; Regenerative braking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Hence, it is necessary to limit the harmonics to meet IEEE: 519-2014 harmonic standard. To reduce the harmonic currents, the simplest method is to utilize the passive filters generally known as Harmonic Traps. However, passive filters alone cannot eliminate all harmonic components. Besides, there are limitations on the use of passive filtering. Hence, hybrid filtering technique incorporating passive and active filters is the solution for the present power electronic systems.

The twin problem of placement of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) for observability and placement of dynamic controllers for controllability are solved separately using different techniques. The selected signals are applied as input and output respectively for the centralized Wide area controller. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based coherency identification method has been adopted for selection of signals for observability, while a novel attempt has been made to apply the method of dimension reduction by Sequential Orthogonalisation (SO) for the selection of signals for controllability. A simple damping controller circuit that takes inputs from wide area signals is considered for controlling the inter-area oscillatory modes using the conventional power system controllers. The objective of the study is to determine the applicability and effectiveness of existing traditional damping devices with Wide Area inputs, in complex power systems such as Indian grid, with only traditional controllers. The focus of this study is on inter-area oscillatory modes, for which the modified 39-bus New England Test System (NETS) has been taken as test case.

Agent that has the least energy is elected leader. A leader fault identification method has been developed, based on graph theory, applied to communication establishment. The leader is isolated as faulty if the agents within the communication neighbourhood of the leader are unable to interact with the leader.

Wireless power can be achieved across large air gap which will be backbone for the future automation industry. This paper presents the analysis, design and simulation studies of the CLC based Resonant Dual Active Bridge (RDAB) topology for the inductive wireless power transfer application in the hybrid electric vehicle. The main advantage of RDAB topology to the Conventional Dual Active Bridge (DAB) topology is the requirement of less reactive power due to the 'Resonance' created by CL (capacitor + inductor) circuit in the primary and a Capacitor in the secondary side of the high frequency transformer. The bridge current (switch current) is reduced due to the low reactive power and it helps in achieving high efficiency due to reduction in the conduction loss as well as power factor of the model. Reactive power is supplied by the capacitor in the primary side of the transformer. RDAB also provides Zero Voltage Switching at wide range of load. The complete system is analyzed and simulated in PSIM 9.1.

The wind energy conversion system consists of a wind turbine coupled to DFIG (Double Fed Induction Generator) equipped with MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking). The MPPT demands speed control which is realized using vector control of the rotor side converter. The voltage and frequency control is achieved through load side converter connected to the common DC bus. Solar PV power is fed to the same DC bus using DC-DC boost converter which is also equipped with MPPT algorithm to extract maximum energy from the incident solar energy. The system is modeled in Sim-Power System tool of MATLAB and its performance under all the practical conditions e.g. varying wind speed and radiation; unbalanced and nonlinear load is presented. Under all these conditions; the stator currents flowing through DFIG are balanced and sinusoidal. The harmonics in load voltage under all conditions are within requirement of IEEE 519 standard. The scheme doesn't envisage measurement of any mechanical quantities e.g. wind speed or rotor position. Finally the effectiveness of the system is demonstrated experimentally using a 3.7 kW DFIG and a 5 kW solar array simulator. © 2016 IEEE.","DFIG; Hybrid System; Micro-grid; Power Quality; Renewable Energy System; Solar PV Energy; Vector Control and Battery Energy Storage System; Wind Energy","Asynchronous generators; DC-DC converters; Electric inverters; Energy conversion; Hybrid systems; Intelligent control; Maximum power point trackers; Power control; Power converters; Power electronics; Power quality; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Vector control (Electric machinery); Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage systems; DFIG; Micro grid; Renewable energy systems; Solar-pv energies; Electric power system control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The proposed scheme uses only two successive cycles (one cycle pre and one cycle post fault samples) of the three phase current signals to estimate ground current signal at one end. Energy is obtained by decomposition of discrete wavelet transforms using Haar mother wavelet. Then, a novel feature selection technique based on differential wavelet energy is implemented in wavelet components in the sort of 1 KHz- 2 KHz. Finally, optimal features are normalized and fed to fuzzy logic for classification tasks. The possibility of the proposed scheme is tested in a 400-kV, 300 km long transmission line under different simulation conditions using MATLAB software.

Wind energy has been a major source of energy for the society for the past thousand years. Wind energy is a clean and pollution free energy source which can be relied up on for the long-term future. A wind turbine creates cost-effective, pollution free, reliable sources of energy. A single wind turbine is sufficient for the generation of energy which is required by a household. Wind turbines generates power without the usage of fossil fuels, neither have they produced greenhouse gases nor they generate radioactive or toxic waste. There is always a significant need for better sources of energy that is long term reliable. The dependence on conventional sources of energy must be reduced, better and renewable sources of energy must be investigated and should be brought into use. There are various factors affecting the energy generation using wind turbines such as wind parameters which are natural and the turbine parameters. The wind turbine design and its dimensions are one of the major factors affecting the output voltage generated by the wind turbines. The wind turbine blades design includes the pitch angle, the blade length, the width of the blade, weight and the aerodynamic modeling of the blades. Therefore it is necessary to study the effect of all these parameters on the output voltage generated by the conventional type of horizontal axis wind turbines. The paper describes the study of various parameters affecting the working of wind turbines and their effect on the output voltage. © 2016 IEEE.","Blade Parameters; Output Voltage; Wind Turbine; Wind Turbine Blades","Aerodynamics; Cost effectiveness; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent control; Pollution; Power control; Power electronics; Radioactive waste disposal; Toxic materials; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind power; Aerodynamic modeling; Blade parameters; Energy generations; Horizontal axis wind turbines; Output voltages; Renewable sources; Turbine parameters; Wind turbine blades; Wind turbines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Lead-acid battery is commonly used in high power PV applications due to its low cost and availability in large size. The modeling of PV system and lead-acid battery by using the corresponding equivalent circuits are discussed here. Three independent control loops are proposed to control the standalone PV system; MPPT control loop for extracting maximum power from PV module under different solar irradiation, battery control loop for bidirectional power flow between battery and dc-link through buck-boost converter to keep the input dc voltage constant, and inverter control loop for maintaining good voltage regulation and achieving fast dynamic response under sudden load fluctuations. The stability of the above control loops are verified by using Bode diagram. Finally the proposed method is applied to 2 kW, 110 V, 50 Hz, two-stage single-phase standalone PV system.

However the BLDC motor frameworks have questionable and nonlinear attributes which corrupt execution of controllers. Sliding mode controllers (SMC) are very useful in controlling the non-linearities in the system. But due to the effect of chattering in SMC based drives, the use of controller is limited.

Most of them have been limited to commercial applications such as vehicular tracking (e.g tracking of a train etc). However, not much work has been done towards design of a personal tracking system. Our Research work is an attempt to design such personal tracking system. In this paper, we have shared glimpses of our research work. The objective of our research project is to design & develop a system which is capable of tracking and monitoring a person, object or any other asset of importance (called as target). The system uses GPS to determine the exact position of the target. The target is aided with a compact handheld device which consists of a GPS receiver and GSM modem. GPS receiver obtains location coordinates (viz. Latitude & Longitude) from GPS satellites. The location information in NMEA format is decoded, formatted and sent to control station, through a GSM modem. Due to use of Open CPU development platform, no external Microcontroller is required, with additional advantage of compact size product, reduced design & development time and reduced cost. Thus, the proposed system is able to track the accurate location of target. This system finds applications in tracking old-age people, tracking animals in forest, tracking delivery of goods etc. Our final designed system is a small-size compact 1.5""X3.75"" Tracker system with position accuracy error <30m (100 feet). © 2016 IEEE.","AT Commands; GPS; GSM; Navigation; NMEA; OpenCPU; Tracking","Contracts; Global system for mobile communications; Intelligent control; Location; Modems; Navigation; Power control; Power electronics; Product design; Surface discharges; Target tracking; Tracking (position); AT command; Commercial applications; Design and implementations; Development platform; Location information; NMEA; OpenCPU; Position accuracy; Global positioning system",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Every machine has a limitation over speed and torque requirement. So according to today's scenario; a machine is required which fulfils most of the industrial applications by its wide range of speed and torque. The objective of the paper is to analyse the speed control of axial flux permanent magnet motor (AFPM). It is very interesting that due to very wide topologies of AFPM machines; it fits into many applications. In recent years as the technology advances in low speed applications; permanent magnet synchronous machines have become more popular. With advancement in electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies; it forced the development and control of high performance; direct drive electrical machines. The AFPM motors are not like conventional brushless dc motors (BLDC); so to control AFPM motor is rather complicated. The speed control of AFPM is another area of research where effective control strategies of AFPM motor can be studied.

The estimation of battery parameters deploys experimental methods that are expensive, require high computational power and are time-consuming. Hence, two commonly used equivalent circuit battery models are tested using GA, PSO, ASMO and DE optimization techniques. Estimation has been done by the estimated voltage curves closeness to the known catalog voltage curve. Feasibility of various optimization techniques is evaluated by the accuracy of predicted model and the rate of convergence in predicting the model parameters. Investigation showed that DE algorithm has the best accuracy among meta-heuristic optimizers for battery parameter estimation for first order model while ASMO has best accuracy for the second order model. Further analysis showed that for both the models, DE algorithm was reliable as well as computationally less expensive compared to other optimization techniques. Also the second order RC model proved out to be more robust as for almost all scenarios the performance of optimization algorithm improved by use of this model. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery Electric Vehicle; Equivalent Models; Meta-Heuristics Techniques; Parameter Estimation","Battery electric vehicles; Battery management systems; Circuit simulation; Electric batteries; Equivalent circuits; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Intelligent control; Lithium-ion batteries; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power control; Power electronics; Secondary batteries; Timing circuits; Equivalent circuit model; Equivalent model; Experimental methods; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic techniques; Optimization algorithms; Optimization techniques; Rate of convergence; Parameter estimation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467385879,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Agriculture is one of the biggest industries where the cost-effective wireless sensor technology is effectively applied to support its functions. Clustering is one of the ways to achieve energy efficiency in such networks. In clustered network, few nodes play the role of cluster heads, summative the data from their members, and pass on them to the sink for further processing.

A good majority of Cloud offer services processing of huge data. Although the resources are not limited in cloud, when the services are been expanded, there arises a high demand for storage space. The idea of data de-duplication gains its importance here by offering less storage space needs and hence saving the disk expenditures. However there do also exists some issues on data security and privacy. A number of methodologies are present for data security in cloud when using deduplication since the common deduplication techniques favors the deduplication algorithm to fetch and read data in each file. When coming into security challenges, the positives of deduplication unfortunately comes with high price. The proposed system assures deduplication in block-level and confidentiality of the data. Under the hood of Hadoop the system uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for storing data. The same helps to store large files across multiple machines achieving reliability by replicating the data across multiple hosts. The overhead introduced by the mechanism is less and would not be impacting the cost for computation and overall storage. © 2016 IEEE.","Bilinear Pairing; Cloud Computing; Convergent Encryption; De-duplication; Digital signature","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data handling; Electronic document identification systems; File organization; Public key cryptography; Virtual storage; Bilinear pairing; Data de duplications; Data security and privacy; De duplications; Hadoop distributed file systems; Identity Based Encryption; Multiple machine; Security challenges; Digital storage","Reshma, N.S.; Dept. of Computer Science, College of EngineeringIndia; email: lakshmi.g.geetha@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509019861,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The sourcing of storage-as-a-service (STaaS) requires a decision maker to contend with several elements such as pricing structure, application characteristics and quality-of-service requirements, in addition to tactical considerations such as risk propensity and supplier diversification. This makes STaaS sourcing a complex task. Discussion on STaaS sourcing models addressing these aspects and their utility to decision-makers is, however, scant. In this paper, we propose a two-stage holistic approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Goal programming (GP). We derive insights provided by these models from 10800 runs using market-based data. We also use an experiment to assess our hypothesis concerning the impact of task complexity on decision-quality. Both these experiments have implications for different business scenarios in the STaaS market, and for decision-making.

The data show an emerging global relation between flood response and the intensity of rainstorms. Flood responses are quantified as watershed residence times (strictly time constants of nonlinear transfer-function models) identified directly from information contained within 15-min rainfall and streamflow observations. The emerging monotonic, curvilinear relation indicates that (subsurface) watershed residence time decreases as mean intensity rises, and is seen over a wide range of synoptic conditions from temperate and tropical climates.

But, in case of renewable energy based microgrids, the inherent involvement of static power electronics based power conversion raises the issues of poor power quality and instability during uncertainties due to lack of effective control facility and sufficient moment of inertia. So, an attractive way of mitigating the above mentioned key concerns is to make the microgrid's operation similar to rotary electrical machines based power plant by retaining the advantages of using power electronic converter. With this idea, this paper proposes 'Virtual Synchronous Motor (SM)-Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based Automatic Control Strategy (VSMIGC)' for microgrids. This provides controlled modulating signals to control the output of the pulse width modulated power electronic inverter used in microgrids. For the performance analysis of the proposed VSMIGC, various power quality indices are measured during uncertainties and compared with those of conventional 'Voltage-Current Control Strategy (VIC)' based inverters with respect to standard limits. From results, it is seen that the use of VSMIGC has improved the power quality characteristics of renewable energy microgrids. © 2016 IEEE.","Automatic voltage/frequency control; Microgrids; Power quality; Pulse width modulated inverters; Virtual machines","Asynchronous generators; Automation; Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Electric machinery; Power converters; Power electronics; Power quality; Process control; Pulse width modulation; Renewable energy resources; Synchronous motors; Uncertainty analysis; Virtual machine; Voltage regulators; Automatic generation control; Doubly fed induction generators; Micro grid; Power electronic converters; Pulse-width-modulated; Pulse-width-modulated inverter; Quality characteristic; Voltage/frequency controls; Quality control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Modern wireless communication systems uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which has high data rate transmission capability in addition to robustness to channel impairments. One of the major disadvantages of it is having high value of peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High value of PAPR drives power amplifier into saturation region and causes it to operate in the nonlinear region. In this paper different power amplifier linearization and PAPR reduction techniques have been discussed. Among power amplifier linearization techniques digital pre distortion outperforms when compared with feedback and feed forward techniques. On the other hand among different PAPR reduction techniques, DFT-spread technique results in the lowest PAPR value when compared with clipping and filtering (CF), selective mapping method (SLM) and partial transmit sequence (PTS). © 2016 IEEE.","Nonlinearity; Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing; Peak-to-Average Power Ratio; Power Amplifiers","Amplifiers (electronic); Digital storage; Feedback amplifiers; Feedback linearization; Frequency division multiplexing; Linearization; Microwave amplifiers; Microwave generation; Multiplexing; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adjacent channel interference; High data rate transmission; Microwave power amplifier; Nonlinearity; Partial transmit sequence; Peak to average power ratio; Power amplifier linearization; Wireless communication system; Power amplifiers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Organizations can easily outsource their huge amount of data to cloud storage. However, the privacy of data is a big concern. The data privacy can be achieved by encryption techniques, but it increases the difficulty of securely searching data on the cloud because searching in encrypted data is itself a challenging task. Recently many schemes have been proposed but these schemes do not consider the semantic of the query. We proposed a novel method by combining LSI and hierarchical cluster to get the semantic relation between the result and to reduce the search space respectively. Further, to verify the search result authenticity, we use MAC tree along with a cryptographic signature.

A modern storage system is a very complex combination of hardware and software elements and inferring its state from those of its individual components is practically impossible. Moreover, the state of the system undergoes continuous changes due to diverse and evolving workloads, frequent configuration changes and natural degradation in components. This paper presents an approach to predict the future response time of a storage system by applying a combination of machine learning techniques on the data of its internal parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the response time of a storage system directly from the time-series of its internal parameters. We present a systematic experimental setup for collecting the system data and for measuring its response time while loading the system with different standard workloads. Another novel contribution of the paper is a combination of time-series forecasting model followed by a regression model to predict the response time repeatedly in real-time. The said model is shown to be able to repeatedly predict fairly accurate 15-minutes-ahead response time values using the system data of the past 20-minutes' window. It is shown that the validation calculations typically complete within 30 seconds on an average using a computer of moderate configurations making the presented model applicable for practically reasonable prediction horizons. The design of the model is such that it can be adaptively tuned online at regular intervals as more system data is observed. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Forecasting; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Time series; Efficient managements; Forecasting models; Hardware and software; Individual components; Internal parameters; Machine learning techniques; Natural degradation; Time series forecasting models; Response time (computer systems)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this paper we propose an energy-saving video compression technique for WMSN with a newly proposed differential inter frame partial discrete wavelet technique. Considering the application domain where video frames from an array of video sensors are co-related we exploit this inter frame co-relation by taking the partial wavelet transform between the frames followed by identifying the difference of wavelet of these frames. The scheme works in accordance with a tree based routing scheme for randomly placed node with an aim to reduce energy consumption further. The evaluation of the proposed scheme is performed through simulation and statistical analysis on the simulation results. The efficiency of the scheme is measured in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Simulation results confirm our scheme's supremacy over the competing schemes in terms of energy while maintaining an acceptable reconstruction quality. © 2016 IEEE.","Compression; Differential inter frame partial discrete wavelet transform; Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network","Compaction; Digital storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Multimedia systems; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; Wireless sensor networks; Compression techniques; Inter-frame; Peak signal to noise ratio; Reconstruction quality; Reduce energy consumption; Tree-based routing; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN); Image compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036462,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

Two approaches for dealing with this bottleneck have generated considerable interest amongst researchers in the recent past. The first approach is the building of heterogeneous systems that offload a part of the computational workload to co-processors. The offload of a part of the computation to a co-processor causes CPU cycles to be freed up. These freed-up CPU cycles can then be used for running other tasks. Offloading also allows the building of accelerated solutions that run significantly faster. Thus, offloading allows the processing of larger workloads by the system. The second approach that has generated interest is the compression of data. The storage and network latencies for bigdata solutions are reduced significantly when data compression techniques are employed. The associated bandwidth requirements too are reduced, as are the hardware requirements. However, a marriage of the two approaches - compression on a co-processor - has remained a challenge due to the inherent characteristics of the compression algorithms that have made them poor choices for implementation on co-processors such as GPGPUs. In this paper, an implementation of the popular bzip2 compression algorithm that utilizes a GPGPU for a part of its computing is presented. A marginal improvement of 1.4x in performance when compared to the standard CPU-based algorithm is delivered by this implementation, while freeing up CPU cycles by a significant 50% at the same time. This speedup is better than any previously published work. The challenges in getting a good performance for bzip2 on a GPU are discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Acceleration; Burrows-wheeler-transform; Bzip2; Compression; GPU; Suffix-array","Acceleration; Compaction; Coprocessor; Digital storage; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Burrows Wheeler transform; Bzip2; Compression algorithms; Computational workload; Data compression techniques; Heterogeneous systems; Inherent characteristics; Suffix arrays; Data compression",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509057733,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The architecture uses machine learning techniques to proactively predict and judge the performance of the system and make decisions for effective resource management for the database.

As Hadoop MapReduce is a widely used and famous execution engine for working with the storage and analysis of large datasets. In MapReduce, the data is read from the disk and the result is written to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) after a particular iteration and then the data is read from the HDFS for the next iteration. This whole process consumes a lot of disk space and time as well. The users had been objecting the problem of high latency and fault tolerance of the entire system. To overcome the issues and disadvantages of MapReduce, Apache Spark was developed. Apache Spark is an open-source project that ensures lower latency queries, iterative computations and real time processing on similar data. This paper also focuses on time-series analysis in Hadoop and Spark environment which processes and does analysis of real-time data and generates a pattern out of it to get a clearer glimpse of the statistics and characteristics of data thus making Spark even more efficient over MapReduce. © 2016 IEEE.","Apache Spark; Bigdata Analytics; Hadoop; HDFS; High Performance Analytics; Time Series Analysis","Data handling; Digital storage; Fault tolerance; File organization; Harmonic analysis; Time series; Bigdata Analytics; Hadoop; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); HDFS; High Performance Analytics; Iterative computation; Open source projects; Realtime processing; Time series analysis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

Orthogonal Frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is best choice in this regard which supports high data rates and bandwidth efficiency. As the number of subcarriers used in OFDM systems increases the data rates supported by it also increases at the cost of high Peak to average power ratio. The high PAPR leads to non-linearities in the system which is unwanted. Upcoming OFDM systems may drive the number of subcarriers used to meet the thrust of data rate demands. So it is required to alleviate the high PAPR that appear. Partial transmit sequence (PTS) is a technique for reduction in PAPR among other techniques. In this paper a method which combines both PTS and Adaptive Peak Power Reduction techniques (APPR). APPR uses an adaptive algorithm to maintain the peak level of modulated signal.

Cloud computing service providers require a system which can handle a large number of requests at a time and is needed to be highly available. Major issue faces in cloud computing is Security and data retrieval. In data security an important problem is to prevent illegal modifications and data loss. But, for this it requires either data replication or on-demand computation of a function over the entire contract out data. Generally system keeps multiple copies of the blocks of data on different nodes by replication. Another issue is retrieval of data, whereas in the cloud computing environment it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in the entire globe. Load on system may increase when there is high demand of a data. In this, the main focus is on the problems of security, replication and availability of data. The proposed system use a fragmentation and sole replication (FASR) concept in the cloud to improve the security and data retrieval time rather than using traditional cryptographic techniques. It fragments the file, place every single fragment in distinct node and perform sole replication that is every fragment is replicated only once, to provide security. Particularly selection of primary node is done through hotbed measure, selection of node and placement of other fragments is done through T-coloring technique, which limits tampering of data. Thereby improve retrieval time for easy accessing of the fragments for reconstruction of original file on user request. In this user can download, update and upload the file again. User can also request for required fragments and can update, upload it to cloud. Another automatic updating technique is proposed which allow uploading of only updated fragment in the cloud node. FASR concept provides security; save time and automatic updating technique reduce the resource utilized. Non-cryptographic nature makes the system even faster. © 2016 IEEE.","Automatic updating technique; node Selection; Sole replication data retrieval time; T-coloring","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Automatic updating; Cloud computing environments; Cloud computing services; Cryptographic techniques; Data retrieval; Node selection; On-demand computations; T-coloring; Search engines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395458,,,"English","Proc.

Efficient resource management plays a pivotal role in the execution along with attaining high performance standards in Distributed environments. Resource provisioning and scheduling has become an important area of research in cloud resource management. Clouds can be handled in a more predictable way through a well designed provisioning strategy. Workflow and bag of tasks are the two main categories of applications usually considered for execution in a cloud environment. Bag of task consists of a number of independent tasks whereas workflow is a combination of several mutually dependent tasks. An execution of scientific workflows (more dependencies) will incur more data storage and communication cost. Here we empirically study how the cost and makespan for execution of scientific applications varies with increase in file size and network bandwidth. This paper deals first with the provisioning strategies and henceforth investigates the impact of Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning strategies when different file sizes are used. The role of data and communication being interpreted here as other costs in case of scientific workflow applications has been taken here as a comprehensive study. Our study here in this paper uses simulation to analyze their actual impact practically on the VM provisioning strategy used. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Resource Provisioning; Scheduling","Cloud computing; Costs; Digital storage; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Smart city; Virtual machine; Cloud computing technologies; Distributed environments; Execution platforms; Performance standards; Resource management; Resource Provisioning; Scientific applications; Scientific workflows; Scheduling","Rajni; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Sahyadri College of Engineering and ManagementIndia","Yang L.T.Chen J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042968,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Malware attacks such as virus, worm and rootkits etc. are some threats to virtual machines (VMs) in cloud environment. In this paper, we present a system call analysis approach to detect malware attacks which maliciously affect the legitimate programs running in Virtual Machines (VMs) and modify their behavior. Our approach is named as 'Malicious System Call Sequence Detection (MSCSD)' which is based on analysis of short sequence of system calls (n-grams). MSCSD employs an efficient feature representation method for system call patterns to improve the accuracy of attack detection and reduce the cost of storage with reduced false positives.

This format of data, consumes less effort and storage. Thus a number of organization and institutes are preserving their information in this format. In this presented work the data and their privacy is the main area of study. In the proposed work an organization is considered where the decisions are made with the different department based data and their attributes. Additionally to make decisions the attributes of all the departments are required. But the departments are not able to disclose the privacy of data owner. Therefore to combine the data attributes and mining of the combined data need a privacy preserving technique for preventing the privacy issues in a centralize database. In this paper we demonstrate how the different departments of same organization combine their data without harming the privacy of the client for making effective decisions in efficient and accurate manner. Thus the method vertically data combination, cryptography and decision mining is demonstrated. To mine the decisions from the data a C4.5 decision tree is used. The implementation of the proposed privacy preserving data mining and decision making technique is performed using JAVA technology. Additionally the performance of the system is computed in terms of accuracy, error rate, memory consumption and time consumption. Finally to justify the outcomes of the proposed data mining technique the traditional J4.5 tree using WEKA tool is used with same data for comparative performance study.

EEG signal acquisition usually last for 2-8 hours, or can be extended over a week. This places a bigger problem on storage requirements as well as transmission of EEG. So, EEG signal compression is attaining more interest on medical field. EEG data needs to have more clinical importance as it deals with a patients health, hence requires an effective compression system involving perfect reconstruction of signal. The proposed method includes processing, band separation of EEG signal and identifying wavelets suitable for efficient compression of EEG.

There are many application domains that IoT technology can provide very useful services such as health care, transportation, infrastructure and home. Smart devices have limited efficiency in terms of computing storage and battery power. Due to the limited storage of embedded devices, it is difficult to implement strong authorization techniques. To overcome, this problem in the IoT, we have proposed a novel architecture for building a service using open authentication protocol where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system through the IoT device. Among the various authentication protocols available today, OAuth provides many leading organizations with a simple and secure way to authenticate users and permit them to access their protected data. OAuth provides client applications secure delegated access which is commonly used for Internet users to log in to third party websites using their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts without exposing their password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the user, giving the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. We are proposing a smart fire alarm system that notifies the user about the occurrence of fire in his house. User gets an alert message through his twitter and Gmail account simultaneously. Fire alarm system is built by integrating IoT technology with temperature detecting sensors. In order to use Gmail and twitter our device need to authenticate on behalf of the user. For this we use OAuth protocol for delegated access to applications like Gmail and twitter. Conventional end-To-end encryption based techniques are not accurate to ensure better quality of security because of exceeding slow response time of the smart devices, and has extremely low processing clock speed. The proposed work can offer very high level of security without compromising on the processing lack. Results shows that, device offers a low latency as compared to existing system having with 35 to 45 milliseconds for implementing the OAuthenticaion scheme.","Authorization; Internet of things; Open authentication (OAUTH) Protocol","Access control; Alarm systems; Cryptography; Digital storage; Fire alarm systems; Home health care; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Social networking (online); Authentication protocols; Authorization; Client applications; End-to-end encryption; Existing systems; Novel architecture; Quality-of-Security; Temperature detecting; Authentication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

Highlights of erasure coded storage systems are that these offer the same level of fault tolerance as that of replication, at lower storage footprints. In the big data era, cloud storage systems based on data replication are of dubious usability due to 200% storage overhead in data replication systems. This has prompted storage service providers to use erasure coded storage as an alternative to replication. Refinements are required in various aspects of erasure coded storage systems to make it a real contender against data replication based storage systems. Streamlining huge bandwidth requirements during the recovery of failed nodes, inefficient update operations, effect of topology in recovery and consistency requirements of erasure coded storage systems, are some areas which need attention. This paper presents an in-depth study on the challenges faced, and research pursued in some of these areas. The survey shows that more research is required to improve erasure coded storage system from being bandwidth crunchers to efficient storage systems. Another challenge that has emerged from the study is the requirement of elaborate research for upgrading the erasure coded storage systems from being mere archival storage systems by providing better update methods. Provision of multiple level consistency in erasure coded storage is yet another research opportunity identified in this work.

(2) In cluster level fault tolerance model where cluster head receives data from all nodes and received data of each node is compared with all other nodes data and computes the difference. Fault tolerance in cluster level is achieved by eliminating the incorrect data of nodes. (3) In sink level fault tolerance algorithm, where sink periodically broadcast alive packets to all nodes and duplicate sink node. After that, nodes transmit data to duplicate sink node. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested in terms of performance parameters such as energy consumption, error, node level faults and cluster level faults.","Cluster level; Fault tolerance; WSN","Digital storage; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Mobile agents; Multi agent systems; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster level; Fault-tolerance algorithms; Fault-tolerance models; Limited communication; Node-level fault tolerances; Performance parameters; Reference range; Storage capacity; Sensor nodes",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

Due to the advantages of time, speed and cost effectiveness, a lot of people use it for commercial advertisement purposes resulting in unnecessary e-mails at user inboxes called spam. Spam is the unnecessary and unwanted commercial e-mail. It is also known as junk e-mail. It is sending unnecessary e-mail message with profit-making data to in discriminated group of recipients. It is waste of storage space, time, and network bandwidth. E-mail classifier classifies the group of mails into ham and spam based on its data content. E-mail classifications system, which clean the spam e-mails from inbox, move it to the spam folder. The proposed e-mail classification system includes two stages, such as training stage and testing stage. Initial stage, input e-mail message is sent to the feature selection module to pick the suitable feature for spam classification. In this paper, firefly and GSO algorithm is efficiently combined to pick the appropriate features from the big dimensional area using correlation. Once the finest feature space is determined through FSO algorithm, the E-mail classification is accomplished using weighted based majority voting system. The classifiers applied for classifying e-mails are naive bayes algorithm, neural networks and decision tree. The UCI spambase dataset is utilized for e-mail spam classification. The research result validation of the proposed technique is made through evaluation metrics such as, precision, recall and accuracy.","Classification; Decision tree; E-mail; Firefly; Group search optimiser; Naive bayes; Neural networks; Spam; Spambase classification; Spambase dataset","Bioluminescence; Classifiers; Cost effectiveness; Data mining; Decision trees; Digital storage; Electronic mail; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Trees (mathematics); Voting machines; Firefly; Group search optimiser; Naive bayes; Spam; Spambase dataset; Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012855,,,"English","Proc.

Such data which are continuous, unbounded, fast are termed as stream data. Clustering is the best method for analysis of stream data. As labeling of data is not possible for streams so clustering may assist this process. Also framing clusters digs out the points which do not seem to be part of cluster thus assisting outlier detection also.

The architecture is based on a hybrid optical-packet approach and uses broadcast domains and wavelength division multiplexing for communication. The salient feature of this architecture is that all network paths are readily available in the optical domain and there is no need for optical path establishment. A source-destination pair must tune to a predefined wavelength at a scheduled time during data transfer. Every compute and storage node (CSN) is equipped with one or more tunable optical transceivers. As with any broadcast network, multiple transmitters that share a link segment cannot use the same wavelength on a link at the same time since this would result in collisions. Hence, transmission scheduling is required to prevent collisions and to allot an exclusive time duration for every transmission request. This paper's focus is on the time synchronization aspect that is critical for scheduling. Two schemes - continuous and discrete (slotted) time - are defined and evaluated. The objective of this paper is to understand the various factors affecting performance of these synchronization mechanisms. With the former scheme, clock accuracy has a significant impact on performance. With the latter scheme, propagation delay variance and packet length distribution impact performance in terms of utilization. The paper presents an evaluation of the performance of these mechanisms in the context of the OGDCN architecture. The results show that continuous time is able to better efficiently utilize network resources. © 2016 IEEE.","Centralized scheduling; Data center networks; Hybrid Optical-Packet Switched networks; Network Architecture; Optical Traffic Grooming; Time synchronization","Continuous time systems; Data transfer; Digital storage; Optical communication; Optical switches; Optical transceivers; Scheduling; Synchronization; Wavelength division multiplexing; Centralized scheduling; Data center networks; Optical packet switched network; Optical traffic grooming; Time synchronization; Network architecture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052523,,,"English","2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference, IPCCC 2016",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013499822

In particular, for purposes of high availability and disaster recovery, replication of this data on cloud storage needs to be implemented efficiently. To that end, in this paper, we investigate the combined problem of uploading IoT data from a set of sensor gateways and efficient replication of this data on distributed cloud storage. While other efforts do exist in this space, either they do not consider replication in context of small size and high number of data items, which is inherent nature of IoT data or they concentrate on the access time after replication. Our solution assumes the existence of multiple distributed cloud data centers, called mini-Clouds, among which data can be replicated. We model our problem comprehensively based on various parameters such as effective bandwidth of the IoT network, available number and size of data items at each mini-Cloud; and we present our problem as a collection of various sub-problems based on subsets of these parameters. We prove that the exact solution to the problem is intractable, and we present a number of heuristic strategies to solve it. Our results show that the performance of any heuristic is bounded by the read and write latency of mini-Clouds and the best we can do is often 12 times the worst we can do for a given number of data items to be uploaded and replicated from the gateways to the mini-Clouds in test setup. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Cloud computing; Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Disaster recovery; Distributed clouds; Effective bandwidth; Heuristic strategy; High availability; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Number of datum; Internet of things",,"Foster I.Radia N.Foster I.","IEEE Computer Society",21596182,9781509026197,,,"English","IEEE Int.

As usage of cloud is increasing, critical and personal data is also being outsourced making it important to maintain confidentiality and integrity of this data. A basic way of protecting data is encrypting it before outsourcing, but the retrieval of required files from the encrypted cloud becomes a problem which requires searching over the encrypted data. Various schemes have been proposed to deal with this issue of searching over encrypted cloud data, however none of the existent schemes provide optimum user search experience resembling plaintext search. In this paper we propose Privacy Preserving Synonym Based Fuzzy Multi-Keyword Ranked Search Over Encrypted Cloud Data, a scheme which enhances user search experience to a paramount by providing both fuzzy and synonym based multi-keyword ranked search, thereby taking encrypted search experience closer to free text search engines. The scheme additionally improves upon index generation time and search time in comparison to existing schemes by utilizing a binary tree based dynamic index. Experimental results portray the effectiveness of this proposed scheme as it reduces the search time, i.e. the time for finding the desired documents, by 90% along with minimizing overhead of updating index when new files need to be uploaded (index generation time) as compared to the existing efficient indexing schemes in literature for a similar dataset.

A lot of innovative practices are anticipated for boosting the device and circuit performance. DG-OTFT i.e. dual gate organic thin film transistors are one of these methods that are used for the enhancement of the organic materials based devices and circuits performance. The DG-OTFT augments the operation of the devices and circuits and also makes the devices sturdy. In this research paper depth analyses of the DG-OTFT for different modes of operation (bottom gate, top gate, and dual gate modes) in terms of threshold voltage, drive current, mobility, sub-threshold slope and current on-off ratio is performed. It is observed that as the two channels are formed in DG-OTFT, it results in superior carrier injection that shows significant enhancement in drive current, in the dual gate mode. Evaluation and validation of electrical characteristics and performance parameters of DG-OTFT using PDPP-TNT as organic semiconductor with the reported experimental results is done using state of the are Atlas 2-D by Silvaco Inc.

However, uncertainty exists in many real life situations such as sensor network and privacy preserving applications. To extract meaningful information from uncertain data a number of frequent pattern mining algorithms have been proposed. While dealing with uncertain data U-Apriori, UF-growth, UFP-growth, UH-mine, PUF-growth, TPC-growth algorithm are examples of existing frequent pattern mining algorithms, which utilize different approaches to mine frequent pattern. One important observation is that algorithms behave completely different in the uncertain database as compared to the precise database due of the inclusion of probability value. In this survey paper, a number of algorithms have been analyzed for finding the frequent pattern from uncertain database. The analysis is represented in the form of comparative study of following algorithm: U-Apriori, UF-growth, UFP-growth, UH-mine, and PUF-growth, TPC-growth algorithm on the basis on various parameters such as database scan, running time, memory utilization and storage structure.

Due to tremendous hike in data production, the need for the efficient processing, transaction storage or retrieval, and management of the structured and unstructured data have become one of the important issues of the IT industry. In this paper, we examine the concept of evolution of various distributed file systems, advantages, and limitations with respect to the cloud computing paradigm. Distributed File System is a client-based application which permits its users to access, process and modify the data which is stored on a remote server as if it existed on their local systems. The Google file system (GFS), a proprietary distributed file system was developed by Google to meet its own growing big data need, which involved the utilization of commodity hardware in managing the massive generation of raw data. Inspired by GFS, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) was developed, which is an open-source community project. It is designed to store large chunks of data sets consistently as well as providing high bandwidth sets for streaming data on client based applications. In this paper, we describe the GFS and HDFS models in detail and relate these two distributed file systems on the basis of their properties and characteristic behavior in different environments. We also discuss several techniques and modifications to prevent and mitigate the limitations of these file systems. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; GFS (Google File System); HBase; HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)","Big data; Cloud computing; Data handling; Digital storage; File organization; Information management; Open systems; Analytical surveys; Commodity hardware; Distributed file systems; Google file systems; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Hadoop distributed file systems; HBase; Open source communities; Distributed computer systems",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

As the swiftness of information generation increases Moore's law at the commencement of this new century, exorbitant data is making great troubles to human beings as well as the society. With the development of information digitization, massive amounts of data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) are generated quickly.

Sharing sensitive data will help organizations to reduce the cost of providing users with personalized services and provide value added data services. Issues related to data security and privacy is of cardinal concern in the age of big data as the data volume is high. The growing popularity and development of big data technologies bring serious threat to the security of individual's sensitive information.

The demand for an easy, comfortable and patient friendly solution for acquisition, processing and remotely transmitting the information from patient to the healthcare centre is increasing day by day. Although few existing techniques are available like the Holter Monitoring and ECG [more than 1-lead] these test are specialized and available in the hospitals/healthcare centres only. While in urban India people do not have time for regular Health checkups, in rural India the lack of awareness towards subdued cardiac pathologies coupled with few available health centres has led to a significant rise in cardiovascular diseases and deaths in the last few decades. Investigations for heart related ailments are still confined to the Electrocardiogram (ECG), Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) Sensor and the Phonocardiogram (PCG). The digital recordings are made by the machines but the data is still saved usually via print formats and analyzed manually by specialists. The aim of this study is to design a solution to the problem via our unique Cardio-Sensor Aggregation Platform (CSAP) for monitoring, storage and diagnosis of the cardiac bio-signals in real-time. The objective was to design the Cardio-Sensor Aggregation Platform (CSAP) in order to capture the data (ECG, Pulse Rate and Heart Sound) in real-time and transmit the same from the CSAP to any mobile device running the application, by using wireless communication technology. The CSAP captures the patient's physiological parameters transforming the signal using custom adaptive filtering which is transferred to the mobile platform for further processing. The data is processed by the smart mobile device and any imminent/ urgent response is given back to the user. Later at off-peak time the data is passed on to the larger system [e.g a hospital medical system] as a medical record for further action and future reference for the clinician or hospital staff. © 2016 IEEE.","CSAP; ECG; PCG; PRV","Adaptive filters; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Electrocardiography; Health; Heart; Hospitals; Mobile devices; Phonocardiography; Physiological models; Rural areas; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cardiac pathologies; Cardio-vascular disease; Continuous monitoring; CSAP; Electronic technologies; Physiological parameters; Pulse rate variability; Wireless communication technology; Data handling","Dutta, M.; Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, JIS College of Engineering, JISCEIndia; email: megh0333@gmail.com","Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The genomic sequences DNA or RNA contain billions of nucleotide bases (A, G, T, C) resulting large sized file to store in computer. In the previous compression algorithms the authors use direct coding technique where two bits are used to code a nucleotide base resulting compression ratio of 2 bits per byte (bpb). Some authors achieve a compression ratio less than 2 bpb after coding repeated bases differently. In this paper we proposed an improvement over direct coding technique that will compress both repeated and non-repeated sequences. The proposed algorithm provides better result as compared to existing algorithms. The existing direct coding algorithm compresses the non-repeated base (B) by prefixing a 0 followed by 2 bits code assigned for that base (i.e. 0B) whereas the repeated bases are compressed by prefixing 1 followed by 2 bits code assigned for that base (B) followed by 3 bits code to represent the number of repetitions (N) (i.e. 1BN). The non-repeated bases are coded by 3 bits and repeated bases by 6 bits but the existing algorithm is limited to compress the repeated sequence till 9 because of 3 bits coding. If the repeated sequence is greater than 9 then it requires a number of bits in multiple of 6 (i.e. 6, 12, and 18, so on). The propped algorithm compress the repeated base by making an improvement over existing one that will code a repeated sequence greater than 9 but less than 15 by prefixing 1 followed by base (B) followed by 111 followed by N (i.e. 1B111N) in 9 bits in place of 12 bits in existing algorithm hence the proposed algorithm provide better compression ratio. © 2016 IEEE.","Compression; De-compression; Direct Coding; DNA; Repeated And Non-Repeated Nucleotide Sequences; RNA","Bandwidth compression; Compaction; Digital storage; DNA; DNA sequences; Nucleic acids; Nucleotides; RNA; Coding algorithms; Coding techniques; Compression algorithms; Direct Coding; Genomic sequence; Limited bandwidth; Nucleotide sequences; Repeated sequences; Codes (symbols)",,"Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Speech enhancement is the method of improving the intelligibility and perceptual quality of a speech signal and automatic speech recognition is converting speech into text equivalent message. In this paper, a speech enhancement technique by processing of wavelet coefficients is presented. The wavelet packet decomposition and wavelet packet reconstruction are used for analysis and synthesis of speech respectively. The performance of the method is evaluated for the speech data that is created in a noise free environment, by comparing the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the noisy speech utterance and reconstructed speech utterance.

A watermarking attack is any processing that may impair watermark detection. There are different types of attacks which can affect the watermarked image which include cropping, noise (salt & pepper, Gaussian), rotation etc. In order to create the copyright issues, these attacks damage the inserted watermark. This paper reviews the performance analysis of the watermarking algorithm based on the combined concept of entropy of block image and LSB Substitution in the presence of different types of attacks to justify the robustness of the algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.","Attacks; Digital watermarking; Entropy; Performance measures; Robustness","Audio watermarking; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Entropy; Robustness (control systems); Attacks; Digital image watermarking; Digital multimedia; Performance analysis; Performance measure; Watermark detection; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking attack; Image watermarking",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Providing security to such servers has become one of the core requirements in today's world as they are under risk of attack. The data stored on the server can range from organizational information such as confidential customer related documents, project details, corporation's software source code to private media information, personal data, national security related information, patients database, question papers of the competitive exams etc. If such sensitive data gets in to wrong hands, it can be misused.Thus the business and the reputation of the organization would beat stake. It can also pose threat to nations.The main reasons of security breach in servers is due to the use of portable storage devices such as pen drives, hard-disks, etc., which can be potential carriers of malware and Trojans. When infected by such virus, these portable storage devices can cause severe damage. Manually maintaining and securing servers would be very difficult and can also lead to huge administrative overhead. Hence the need for automated security mechanism to detect, prevent and protect the servers from the attackers. Security policies play an important role in preventing the compromise of network security which would affect the server security. This paper proposes a framework that would ease the work of an administrator.Itfocuses on designing an automated tool which would perform an audit of the servers and check if it is compliant to all the prescribed security policies. As there are multiple platforms upon which the servers run, the tool is designed to adapt to heterogeneous environment. © 2016 IEEE.","Security patches; Security policies; Server security; Vulnerabilities","Digital storage; Malware; National security; Security systems; Virtual storage; Viruses; Heterogeneous environments; Organizational information; Portable storage devices; Security patches; Security policy; Sensitive informations; Software source codes; Vulnerabilities; Network security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007745,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Based on the number of attempts made by the mobile hosts, the respective Mobile Agent (MA) will have a direct interaction with other MH, which produces the table about recommendations from MA's. Then a cumulative reputation value (CRV) is assigned to each MH. The ACP of a MH is then updated based on the estimated CRV. The MHs having highest CRV can be granted full access control whereas the MHs having least CRV can be granted the least access control. Then the consensus routing algorithm [1] is applied. The nodes with better availability function and CRV are selected as routers for forwarding the data.

And they are trade-offs to each other. But all are important and should be in acceptable range. In this paper we mainly concentrated on power and stability and we designed an optimized proposed 9T-SRAM for low power consumption by placing an NMOS transistor between supply voltage VDD and the latches formed by cross coupled inverters. This NMOS transistor is in diode connected mode and it scales down the VDD. So total power is reduced by 98%. Because power is directly proportional to square of VDD. But this effect the stability, as stability decreases when supply voltage decreases. In order to increase stability an extra PMOS transistor is placed in between access transistor and pull down transistor. This PMOS transistor separate's the storage node and writing node of data. It also scales the bit line voltage and prevent the flipping the contents of cell at low voltages. So stability parameters like SINM, SVNM, WTI and WTV also increased by 93%, 45%, 86% and 56% respectively. In this proposed cell static power is also reduced by 55% due to stacking effect. This all values are when compared with Sub-Threshold 10T SRAM cell. This proposed circuit is also tested by giving 0.3 V power supply.

This paper provides a preventive maintenance approach to access the data, though storage server containing the sensitive data fails. This approach uses a simultaneous copying technique to save the data on both storage server and backup server during the upload process. Thus, when server fails, the data needs of the user can be served by the backup server. Data file is broken into data blocks and these blocks are encrypted and stored in the storage server instead of directly uploading the sensitive data file. Thus, when an intruder gains access to the storage server and tries to access the data, retrieval of the data file is not possible since mapping of files on the data blocks is random and encrypted. This supports preventive maintenance of data which not only secures data but also reduces risk and cost of recovery. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Data deduplication; Preventive maintenance; Sensitive data","Computation theory; Cryptography; Intelligent computing; Maintenance; Preventive maintenance; Random access storage; Back-up servers; Data blocks; Data de duplications; Data files; Sensitive datas; Storage and retrievals; Storage servers; User data; Digital storage","Madhusudhan, V.; Dayananda Sagar College of EngineeringIndia; email: vmadhusudhan91@gmail.com","Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811031557,,,"English","Adv.

Therefore, in this paper, a novel real-time, fast, low-cost, system-on-chip (SoC) controller has been proposed and implemented where large volume of data can be efficiently stored and retrieved from flash memory cards. It is being implemented only using hardware description language (HDL) on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip without using any other on-board or external hardware resources or high-level languages. The entire controller architecture, in a single chip, contains five different modules and is designed using finite state machine (FSM)-based approach. The modules are card initialization module (CINM), idle module (IM), card read module (CRM), card write module (CWM), and decision module (DM). The architecture is completely synthesized for Spartan 3E xc3s500e-4-fg320 FPGA with only 5% of the total logic utilization. The experimental results tested for microSD, SD, and SDHC cards of different size, and these show that the architecture uses less hardware and clock cycles for card initialization and single/multiblock read/write procedure. © 2016, The Author(s).","Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Finite state machine (FSM); Flash memory read/write; MicroSD card; Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) card; Serial peripheral interface (SPI); Very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL)","Computer programming languages; Controllers; Data handling; Digital storage; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Flash memory; Hardware; High level languages; Interface states; Logic gates; Logic Synthesis; Memory architecture; Programmable logic controllers; Real time systems; Search engines; Signal encoding; Smart cards; System-on-chip; Virtual storage; Flash memory read/write; High capacity; MicroSD card; Serial peripheral interface; Very high speed integrated circuits; Computer hardware description languages","Banerjee, S.; Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, University of Calcutta, 92, APC Road, India; email: samiranbanerjee1991@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",16873955,,,,"English","Eurasip J.

These modules process data with the support of heuristic and storage mode transition algorithm. The algorithm is proved efficient in identifying the apt cloud to store data. Storage transition is adopted by considering the cost and data access pattern of the data stored during any requirements. This evaluation enables efficient usage of cloud resources with high availability.

In this paper, an application of the SVM in the multi-class gear-fault diagnosis has been performed based on the gear vibration data in time domain. From time domain data the statistical features are extracted and fed to the SVM for the training/testing. When the training and testing data are at the same running speed, it is found that the SVM classifier has excellent multiclass classification accuracy. Though, this approach relies on the availability of both the training and testing data at that particular speed of the machine operation; it is expected that features of time domain data would change with operating speeds. Moreover, the training data may not always be available continuously at all operating speeds of gears, especially for variable-drive systems. Thus, a novel technique of interpolation/extrapolation has been proposed in the present work that helps the SVM classifier to carryout multi-class gear-fault diagnosis with appreciable accuracy even in the absence of the training data at a given running speed. It also investigates the speed bandwidth of the training data for which interpolation/extrapolation predictions are reasonably good. The similar analysis is also extended to artificial neural networks (ANN) as the classifier and predictions are noted, and compared with the SVM. © 2017 Baishideng Publishing Group Co. Limited.

Due to the crisis of real time communication, victims as well as the rescue team could not fulfill the actual requirement and therefore unable to decide their functionality at any particular point of time. Due to lack of timely genuine situational information, it is quite challenging for any relief or rescue team to assess the exact requirement/damages of affected regions. Many times it has been observed that the distribution of relief materials at different sites did not match with the actual demands, due to adhoc distribution of recourses. As a consequence, in some areas limited amount of relief materials had been sent irrespective of assessing the actual damage. To dealt with these issues, using a subset of existing network architecture an adhoc multi-hop communication system has been designed. A set of applications have been developed on top of it, where victims (mobile nodes) can generate situational information of any affected region regarding to the casualty or need at any particular point of time through a light weight android application. The generated messages will be transferred seamlessly to other mobile nodes on contact. Finally, those messages would be dumped in a master storage box (MSB). As a result, in MSB the information is processed using background applications to wipe out redundancy and inconsistencies. A number of reports could be generated regarding the resource needs of different sites for effective need assessment and resource allocation by the relief organizations at the early stage of any disaster. The proposed group of applications have been tested for a large volume of dummy crowd-sourced data for quality evaluation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Crowdsource; Data; DTN; MSB; Shelter point; Situational","Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Digital storage; Disasters; Global system for mobile communications; Android applications; Data; Infrastructure-less networks; Multi hop communication; Network infrastructure; Real-time communication; Relief organizations; Situational; Network architecture","Mondal, T.; Kalyani Government Engineering CollegeIndia; email: tamalkalyanigov@gmail.com","Mandal J.K.Mukhopadhyay S.Dutta P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811064265,,,"English","Commun.

This huge volume of data storage and transfer is a challenging task, particularly when lower level microcomputers are employed as field devices. The increased computational burden of entropy based compression algorithms and requirement of the probability distribution of symbols makes it difficult to implement for data acquisition. Differential Binary Encoded Algorithm (DBEA) gives a high compression ratio with repetitive, slow varying data array. But it is not suitable for the GSM communication scheme where printable character transmission is possible. An improved algorithm, Modified DBEA (M-DBEA) is developed which not only extends the range of DBEA but also gives a character string containing printable characters only. The results obtained by M-DBEA with practical data values are encouraging and thus implemented at the microcontroller level to develop a handshaking based compressed temperature data transfer system using Arduino UNO microcontrollers. When suitable sensors are used, it is possible to extend the work to develop a smart data management system for compressing real time parameter values collected over the finite time duration and transmit the compressed information through any suitable wired or wireless communication scheme. © 2018 AMSE Presse.

Storage devices contain large amount of digital images, increasing the response time of a system to retrieve images required from such collections, which degrades the performance. Various search skills are needed to find what we are searching for in such large collections. The annotations are given manually for images by describing with the set of keywords. By doing so, the contents of an image retrieve images of interest, but it is time-consuming. Also, different individuals may annotate the same image using different keywords, which make it difficult to create a suitable classification and annotate images with the exact keywords. To overcome all these reasons, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the area which is used for extracting images. The technique gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is discussed and analyzed for retrieval of image. It considers the various features such as color histogram, texture, and edge density.

The rising field of big data analytic has driven the researcher worldwide toward design, development and implementation of various tools, technologies, architecture and platforms for analyzing the huge volume of data generated day to day. Big data consist of data sets which is difficult for legacy database management system to analysis. This paper details some analysis like sentiment analysis, feedback analysis. Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining, is a process of getting views of public from feedback or review. Opinion are central to almost all human activities because they are key influencer of our behavior. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying positive, negative or even neutral opinion. Feedback is detail about reaction to a product, a person performance of a task, etc. that can be used as a basis for enhancement. Feedback are chief means for the system enrichment, finding ambiguities and as well as for proper work distribution. Feedback can be used as a tool to draw proper decision, it is important not only when it highlights weaknesses but also for strengths. Since the feedback can induce both positive and negative, it is mandate to be careful when drawing any conclusion as improper analysis can produce wrong results. As a result the enhancements done will also be wring in the new system.

In our work, we propose a model of social media as a “marketplace of opinions.” Online social media is a participatory medium where several vested interests invest their opinions on disparate issues, and actively seek to establish a narrative that yields them positive returns from the population. This paper focuses on the problem of identifying such potential “drivers” of opinions for a given topic on social media. The intention to drive opinions are characterized by the following observable parameters: (a) significant level of proactive interest in the issue, and (b) narrow focus in terms of their distribution of topics. We test this hypothesis by building a computational model over Twitter data. Since we are trying to detect an intentional entity (intention to drive opinions), we resort to human judgment as the benchmark, against which we compare the algorithm. Opinion drivers are also shown to reflect the topical distribution of the trend better than users with high activity or impact. Identifying opinion drivers helps us reduce a trending topic to its “signature” comprising of the set of its opinion-drivers and the opinions driven by them. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Drivers; Opinion marketplace; Social media","Commerce; Digital storage; Truck drivers; Computational model; High activity; Human judgments; Observable parameters; Online social medias; Opinion marketplace; Social media; Trending topics; Social networking (online)","Bhanushali, A.; International Institute of Information Technology, 26/C, Electronics City, India; email: anish.bhanushali@iiitb.org","Paschke A.Debruyne C.Gaaloul W.Papazoglou M.Panetto H.Ardagna C.A.Meersman R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319694580,,,"English","Lect.

There is a huge demand of ground water for different uses like agriculture, drinking and industrial purposes as the command area is very low in the state and it is evidenced by the fact that around 70% irrigation is dependent on ground water sources as compared to other surface sources like Tanks/Canals/Reservoirs etc. Climate change has affected the hydrological cycle with uncertain and increased variability in rainfall followed by with high rainfall in a short span of time resulting more surface runoff which ultimately decreases the recharge to groundwater. Decreased recharge to the groundwater and excess withdrawal of groundwater has accelerated the depletion of groundwater resources there by resulting in stress on groundwater regime in terms of quality as well as quantity. The groundwater quality evaluation of Telangana state is carried out by using legacy quality data (2012-14) collected from Rural Water Supply & Sanitation Department, Government of Telangana. Contamination spread of groundwater is one of the most important concerns that have received attention at regional, local and global levels because of their importance on public health and its further impact in ecosystems. The spatial distribution of chemical parameters like pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Total Hardness (TH), Total Alkalinity (TA), Fluoride (F), Chloride (Cl), Iron (Fe), Nitrate (NO3) and Sulfate (SO4) are examined with respect to its contamination level. The spatial distribution and concentration of chemical elements is carried out by using spatial interpolation technique namely Inverse Distance Weightage (IDW) method from the point source data. The distribution maps reveal important information to understand the hot spot areas of the groundwater systems and for identification of potential areas for providing safe drinking water supply. Site specific water conservation and artificial recharge measures are needed to be taken up with scientific lines by using Remote Sensing & GIS techniques, for enhancing the groundwater storage and also improving its quality. © 2017 ACRS.

Users can get a variety of services such as high computation power, storage, etc. Thus, applications of users can be more cost-effectively put on cloud by utilizing various commodity computers together. But, cloud computing faces some security concerns even if they provides many services. Some of such important concerns are data security and privacy of data. Some personal data like personal healthcare records and financial records contain sensitive information which can be analyzed and mined for public researches although these records offer important human assets. Data should be privacy preserved because malicious cloud users or untrusted cloud providers can get the data with less effort. To deal with these problems, privacy-aware set-valued data publishing on cloud for personal healthcare records has been proposed. An efficient privacy-aware system, named PHKEM (Personal Healthcare k-anonymity Encryption Model), for eliminating privacy breaches in publishing of personal healthcare data on cloud as well as data querying is designed. A data anonymization technique, named k-Anonymity with extended quasi-identifier partitioning (EQI-partitioning), interactive differential privacy, and AES encryption is applied to preserving personal healthcare records to prevent unauthorized access.

The smart city aims to drive economic growth and improve the living standards using state-of-the-art technology. Evolution of wireless sensor networks has been started from the idea that small wireless sensors can be used to gather information from the physical environment, in many situations ranging from monitoring the environmental, surveillance for security, health care, automated building control, traffic control, and object tracking. Sensors help each other to relay the information to the base station. The existing work includes simulation of routing protocols for WSNs in smart city and some hardware implementation. This paper presents a swarm intelligent routing algorithm for wireless sensor network to implement smart city. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm being most efficient is chosen for implementation (Yamille dl valle et al. in IEEE Trans Power Syst 12 (2):171−195, 2008 [1]).

When multiple users are involved, the system needs to ensure that only controlled information is disclosed to a legitimate user and also a dishonest user colluding with the cloud provider cannot leak any thing beyond the granted privileges. The proposed model is designed to support fine grained search control on selected set of documents by authorized users. The system does not require shared keys or expensive trusted third parties.

Linked Open Data (LOD) refers to a set of best practices that empower enterprises to publish and interlink their data using existing ontologies on the World Wide Web. Current research in LOD focuses on expert search, the creation of unified information space and augmentation of core data from an enterprise context. However, existing approaches for publication of enterprise data as LOD are domain-specific, ad-hoc and suffer from lack of uniform representation across domains. The paper proposes a novel methodology called LinkED that contributes towards LOD literature in two ways: (a) streamlines the publishing process through five stages of cleaning, triplification, interlinking, storage and visualization; (b) addresses the latest challenges in LOD publication, namely: inadequate links, inconsistencies in the quality of the dataset and replicability of the LOD publication process. Further, the methodology is demonstrated via the publication of digital repository data as LOD in a university setting, which is evaluated based on two semantic standards: Five-Star model and data quality metrics. Overall, the paper provides a generic LOD publication process that is applicable across various domains such as healthcare, e-governance, banking, and tourism, to name a few.","Digital repository; Enterprise data; Enterprise-web interoperability; Linked open data; Semantic web","Government data processing; Interoperability; Publishing; Semantic Web; Digital repository; Enterprise data; Enterprise webs; Information spaces; Linked open data (LOD); Linked open datum; Semantic Web technology; University settings; Digital storage",,,"University of Zagreb",13301136,,,,"English","J.

A continuously learning software intervention that dynamically adapts to the changing workload pattern would be the easiest way to bridge this ‘gap’. As borne out by our experiments, the overhead induced by such software interventions turns out to be negligible for large-scale storage systems. Reinforcement Learning offers a way to dynamically learn from a continuous data stream and take appropriate actions towards optimizing a future goal. We adapt policy gradient reinforcement learning to learn a policy that minimizes I/O wait time that in turn maximizes I/O throughput. A set of discrete actions consisting of switches between scheduling schemes is considered to dynamically re-order client-specific I/O operations.

In order to achieve high-speed big data processing, we proposed a system design which involves two-tier storage architecture which is the combination of HDFS and in-memory-based file system tachyon. Also, our architecture involves Apache Spark, an open-source in-memory-based data processing tool to analyse the big data.

We propose a self-tuning scheme for large storage filers, on which very little work has been done in the past. Our system uses the performance counters generated by a filer to assess its health in real-time and modify the workload and/or tune the system parameters for optimizing the operational metrics. We use a Pruned Random Forest based solution to predict overload in real-time — the model is run on every snapshot of counter values. Large number of trees in a random forest model has an immediate adverse effect on the time to take a decision. A large random forest is therefore not viable in a real-time scenario. Our solution uses a pruned random forest that performs as well as the original forest. A saliency analysis is carried out to identify components of the system that require tuning in case an overload situation is predicted. This allows us to initiate some ‘action’ on the bottleneck components. The ‘action’ we have explored in our experiments is ‘throttling’ the bottleneck component to prevent overload situations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Feature ordering; Filer; Pruning; Random forest; Self-tuning; Storage; Storage load","Data mining; Decision trees; Digital storage; Energy storage; Feature order; Filer; Pruning; Random forests; Selftuning; Forecasting","Dheenadayalan, K.; International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: d.kumar@iiitb.org","Cao L.Shim K.Lee J.-G.Kim J.Moon Y.-S.Lin X.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319575285,,,"English","Lect.

In the recent times, village streets have been illuminated with artificial lights as a part of rural development drive undertaken by the governments of respective countries. But, vehicle and pedestrian traffic is quite low through village roads. Hence, if light remains on all night long on such roads, then there is a huge wastage of energy. This calls for solutions to reduce this energy loss in an efficient manner. There are a lot of factors which must be kept in mind while designing solutions. Many villages lack the proper infrastructure to support new technologies. Communication facilities are limited, lack of local technically skilled labor, lack of security, etc. After evaluating these opportunities and challenges, an attempt has been made to devise a smart street lighting solution tailored for remote rural areas in India. One part of the solution discusses how intensity of the LED street lights can be varied according to the ambient lighting conditions using sensors and LED switching in LED matrix. An artificial intelligence (AI) has also been modelled to identify traffic conditions using PIR sensors and object identification through image processing and independently control the lights. It also tracks the performance and status of each light. It would send this data and necessary notifications to a distant control center for human evaluation. This solution is also applicable for other rural areas throughout the world. © 2017 SPIE.","AI controlled Smart street lighting; Ambient sensing Smart street lighting; Object identification in Smart street lighting solution; Smart street lighting in India; Smart street lighting in remote areas; Smart street lighting in rural areas; Smart street lighting in villages; Switching LED matrix","Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Illuminating engineering; Image processing; Light emitting diodes; Lighting; Regional planning; Street lighting; Ambient sensing; Lighting solutions; Remote areas; Smart street lighting in India; Smart street lighting in villages; Rural areas","Hajra, D.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, B P Poddar Institute of Management and Technology, 137, VIP Road, Poddar Vihar, India","Dietz N.Ferguson I.T.","SPIE",0277786X,9781510612136,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038969990

The mode of this work is to increase accuracy with less data storage and providing high security authentication system using multimodal biometrics. The proposed biometric system uses two modalities, palm print and palm vein. The preprocessing steps begin with image acquisition of palm print and palm vein images using visible and infrared radiations, respectively. From the acquired image, region of interest (ROI) is extracted. The extracted information is encrypted using encryption algorithms. By this method of encryption, after ROI extraction, the storage of data consumes less memory and also provides faster access to the information. The encrypted data of both modalities are fused using advanced biohashing algorithm. At the verification stage, the image acquired is subjected to ROI extraction, encryption and biohashing procedures. The biohash code is matched with the information in database using matching algorithms, providing fast and accurate output.

This key idea will provide security to the stored data. Here in this paper we also propose a (1, k, n) secret image sharing scheme constructed by using (k-1, n-1) secret image sharing scheme.

From the experimental results, it is concluded that the proposed indexing algorithm has reduced storage cost by 85%, along with reduced penetration rate, false acceptance rate and false rejection rate. In addition, hit rate has improved by 25% compared to the existing kd tree technique. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","GIST; Indexing; Multibiometrics; Spectral hashing","Biometrics; Database systems; Digital storage; Speech recognition; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; GIST; Hashing algorithms; Indexing algorithms; Multi-biometrics; Penetration rates; Spectral hashing; Indexing (of information)","Balasundaram, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Pondicherry Engineering CollegeIndia; email: brevathisekar@gmail.com",,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",17558301,,,,"English","Int.

In this work, an Intelligent Replica Manager (IRM) is designed and incorporated in the middleware of the grid for scheduling data-intensive applications. IRM uses a Multi-criteria based replication algorithm which considers multiple parameters like storage capacity, bandwidth and communication cost of the neighboring sites before taking decisions for the selection and placement of replica. Additionally, future needs of the grid site are predicted in advance using modified apriori algorithm, which is an association rule based mining technique.

Inability to get the right price, crop failures, and insurmountable debt are the factors that may drive the farmers to take this extreme step. A key factor for farmers being unable to get market prices is inefficient agriculture supply chain management. We find that the reasons for inefficient supply chain management include lack of reforms in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power due to small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities. Crop failures happen because of poor irrigation facilities. Considering agricultural output and rainfall data from four different states in India we find evidence in favor of association between the cyclical component of agricultural output and rainfall data. Understanding this linkage is important from the perspective of formulating demand management policies (read, intervention by the government and central bank).","Agriculture output; APMC Act; Beveridge-Nelson Decomposition; India; Rainfall","Agriculture; Commerce; Crops; Digital storage; Rain; Agricultural output; APMC Act; Central bank; Crop failures; India; Management policy; Market price; Rainfall data; Supply chain management","Banik, N.; Bennett UniversityIndia; email: nilbanik@gmail.com","Sh Y.Ahuja V.Deepak D.Sh Y.Berg D.Tian Y.Tien J.M.Abidi N.","Elsevier B.V.",18770509,,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

It also faces problems for synchronizing and uploading files and the vast range of internal and external threats for data integrity. Another problem is based on data security in cloud storage, where it does not have a proper encryption technique.

Such sectors try to minimize risk caused due to new technology environment. There is a wait and watch attitude towards new technology and new user experience. These sectors are the last to adopt the latest design trends. Back-office and mid-office applications have not changed much over the last 10-15 years. Some large banks from North America, Europe and Nordic regions are using applications which are more than 50 years old. Design trends like gamification are rarely used in banking sector.

This process or method improves the classification accuracy by removing irrelevant and noisy features. FS is implemented using either batch learning or online learning. Currently, the FS methods are executed in batch learning. Nevertheless, these techniques take longer execution time and require larger storage space to process the entire dataset. Due to the lack of scalability, the batch learning process cannot be used for large data. In the present study, a scalable efficient Online Feature Selection (OFS) approach using the Sparse Gradient (SGr) technique was proposed to select the features from the dataset online. In this approach, the feature weights are proportionally decremented based on the threshold value, which results in attaining zeros for the insignificant features' weights. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach, an extensive set of experiments was conducted using 13 real-world datasets that range from small to large size. The results of the experiments showed an improved classification accuracy of 15%, which is considered to be significant when compared with the existing methods. © 2017 TÜBITAK.","Big-data analytics; Data analysis; Data preprocessing; Feature selection; Online learning","Big data; Data reduction; Digital storage; E-learning; Feature extraction; Attribute selection; Classification accuracy; Data analytics; Data preprocessing; Model construction; Online feature selection; Online learning; Real-world datasets; Classification (of information)","Senthilkumar, R.; Department of Information Technology, Madras Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: radhasenthil@annauniv.edu",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010720986

Today diverse applications generate a tremendous amount of data in different formats. These data and information exchanged on the Web are commonly expressed as nested representation such as XML, JSON, etc. Unlike the traditional database system, they do not possess a rigid schema. In general, the nested data is managed by storing data and its structures separately which significantly reduces the performance of data retrieving. Ensuring efficiency of processing queries which locates the exact positions of the elements has become a big challenging issue. There are different indexing structures which have been proposed in the literature to improve the performance of the query processing on the nested structure. Most of the past researches on nested structure concentrate on the structure alone. This paper proposes new index structure which combines siblings of the terminal nodes as one path which efficiently processes twig queries with less number of lookups and joins.

However, the large volume of data poses difficulties because of increased bandwidth and limited storage space. Hence, this has led to the need for compression techniques. Image compression with block processing allows the coder to adapt to local image statistics and exploit the correlation present among neighboring image pixels. The main degradation factor of block transform coding is blocking artifacts (visually undesirable patterns) at high compression ratios. The degradation occurs because of coarse quantization of the transform coefficients and the independent processing of the blocks. In this paper, the novelty of the algorithm is its ability to detect and reduce the blocking artifacts using nonseparable discrete fractional Fourier transform (NSDFrFT) at high compression ratios. Three transform techniques, namely nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and bicubic interpolation, were implemented. The NSDFrFT-bicubic interpolation resulted in a structurally similar high subjective quality reconstructed image with reduced blocking (for low frequency images) at high compression ratios. Simulation results are calculated with many image quality metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio, mean square error, structural similarity index, and gradient magnitude similarity measure. Evaluations, such as comparisons between the proposed and existing algorithms (DFrFT, FFT), are presented with relevant tables, graphs, and figures. © TÜBÏTAK.","Compression ratios; Discrete fractional Fourier transform; Image compression; Interpolation methods; Nonseparable discrete fractional Fourier transform","Compression ratio (machinery); Digital storage; Fourier transforms; Image processing; Image quality; Interpolation; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Bilinear interpolation; Compression techniques; Discrete fractional Fourier transforms; Image compression algorithms; Interpolation method; Nearest neighbor interpolation; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity indices; Image compression","Jindal, N.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: neeru.jindal@thapar.edu",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020745041

It offers multi-tenancy which is sharing same physical space by many virtual machines. Co-residency of virtual machine on the other side brings more security bumps.

Hence, huge amount of ECG data is being generated daily in hospitals. ECG recording and monitoring consume lots of memory space of digital computers. Data compression plays a vital role in reducing storage space and utilizing transmission bandwidth effectively. Objective of the research work is to propose a robust and effective method for ECG signal compression. This paper includes extraction of key morphological features, statistical features from decomposed signal, analysis in wavelet domain and classification of feature set. To reduce dimensionality of feature set, principle component analysis (PCA) is applied. Accuracy achieved with 15 principle components is same as pure wavelet transform with significant improvement in compression ratio (CR) by a factor of 4:1. MITBIH Arrhythmia database is used for experimentation. Accuracy obtained with K nearest neighborhood (KNN) classifier is 82.60% and sensitivity 92.30%.

Everyday application developers come up with new social networking sites. Consequently, these websites gain huge profit just by providing a platform for the users to communicate. It has already become an important integral part of our daily lives, enabling us to contact our friends and families on time. Since the count of the users of social networks is increasing drastically, storage of such huge amount of data is difficult to accomplish. As a solution, Cloud provides a platform to store this tiny amount of data. More and more social network data has been made publicly available and analyzed in one way or another. However, the issues in securing the data and privacy of users in cloud-based social networks persist. Users are unaware of these issues. They share various pictures, videos and personal data on the networking site which prevail even after deletion. But some of the information revealed is meant to be private hence social network data has led to the risk of leakage of confidential information of individuals. This is because they collect huge personal data and users take risks of trusting them. Since more personalized information is shared with the public, violating the privacy of a target user become much easier. Hence, security of the social networking data stored in the cloud is one of the major issues in cloud-based social networks. In this paper, we propose a framework for secure storing of data on the cloud-based social networks. The framework encrypts the data before storing it in the cloud, and the data is decrypted only with the private key of the user, making the data secure in the cloud. The proxy re-encryption scheme is used to re-encrypt the data to make it more secure. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Privacy attack; social network","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Application developers; Confidential information; Integral part; On-line social networks; Personalized information; Privacy Attacks; Proxy re-encryption schemes; Social networking sites; Network security",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

Here, the question is, how to prepare a storage system that can be able to store any types of data in the corresponding data storage system. Again, the data format conversion of heterogeneous raw data into a particular format is costly and time consuming. Therefore, it is require to have such data storage mechanism which can store the raw data in the data storage system in their originated data format.

Cloud computing being a large-scale distributed computing paradigm can be used to cater for the needs of data intensive applications. There are various approaches for managing the workload on a data intensive cloud. Live migration of a virtual machine is the most prominent paradigm. Existing approaches to live migration use network attached storage where just the run time state needs to be transferred. Live migration of virtual machines with local persistent storage has been shown to have performance advantages like security, availability and privacy. This paper presents an optimised approach for migration of a virtual machine along with its local storage by considering the locality of storage access. Count map combined with a restricted block transfer mechanism is used to minimise the downtime and overhead. The solution proposed is tested by various parameters like bandwidth, write access patterns and threshold. Results show the improvement in downtime and reduction in overhead.

However, there are some significant barriers to cloud computing adoption. One of the most significant barriers of outsourcing data in the cloud computing is its security issues especially when sensitive data such as personal profile, financial records, medical reports, etc. are outsourced on cloud servers. Therefore, strong security measures are essential to protect data within the cloud. Recently, secret sharing schemes have been applied to protect sensitive data in cloud storage. In this paper, we propose a (t, n) multi secret sharing scheme (MSSS) for secure data outsourcing in the cloud. In the proposed scheme, t secrets are divided into n shares, which are distributed to n cloud servers (one share per server) and a trusted user can recover all secrets by combining shares from at least t servers. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can provide secure and efficient data outsourcing system in the cloud. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Cloud storage; Data outsourcing; MSSS; Secret sharing; Trusted user","Cloud computing; Information theory; Intelligent computing; Outsourcing; Cloud storages; Data outsourcing; MSSS; Secret sharing; Trusted user; Digital storage","Nag, A.; Department of IT, Academy of TechnologyIndia; email: amitavanag.09@gmail.com","Mandal J.K.Satapathy S.C.Bhateja V.Sanyal M.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811020346,,,"English","Adv.

The ratio of the size of the XML document to the size of the text data in it is usually large. Apart from data values, the huge size of the XML document is contributed by its tree structure. The structure of the XML document tightly bounded with the data renders the original form of XML less efficient in terms of both time and space. The problem of designing a compressor for XML documents which facilitates both update and query operations has turned the attention of many. In this paper, we propose an efficient storage scheme for XML documents called XQUICK. XQUICK exploits the high regularity of XML documents to compress the tree structure. It also handles updates in an efficient manner with minimum space and time overhead. This paper also describes a novel path-based querying approach that supports fast querying. Additional mechanisms such as indexing are provided to elicit faster query processing.

These structures can be array, class, linked list with its various forms, Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), etc. These can be differentiated in two major forms. First one uses continuous memory allocation and the second one can occupy any free memory block by pointed by the other memory locations. An array occupies continuous memory space for storage purpose and the size should also be known before allocating the space. Perhaps we can use dynamic memory allocation methods for arrays but a Linked List provides better options. There is a disadvantage in Linked List, it does not allow to perform binary search operation on it. The Binary Search Tree is more efficient than the other mentioned data structures. BST provides the two way traversal direction but sometimes the structure of the BST can become unbalanced due to unprocessed ordering of inserted data. In this presented paper, the BST is considered as unbalanced if the number of levels is more than the levels which is required to hold the nodes. The unbalanced BST can lead to a straight tree structure with only one intermediate node at each and every level in the worst case scenario. The structure of BST depends on the insertion order of key elements. By changing the insertion order, BST can be made balanced. The proposed Estimated Level Based Balanced BST provides a solution for finding an insertion order of key elements which will not lead to unbalanced Balanced BST. © 2017 IEEE.","Balanced; Binary Search Tree (BST); Class; Dynamic; Element; Linked List; Memory Allocation; Node; Structure; Traversal and Storage; Unbalanced","Digital storage; Dynamics; Memory architecture; Storage allocation (computer); Structure (composition); Trees (mathematics); Balanced; Binary search trees; Class; Element; Linked List; Node; Unbalanced; Binary trees",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,"English","Proc.

It involves deploying groups of remote servers and software that are networked, that will allow centralised data storage and online access to computer services or resources. However, an important problem in public clouds is how to selectively share data based on fine-grained attribute-based access control policies while at the same time assuring confidentiality of the data and preserving the privacy of users from the cloud. Keeping in mind the confidentiality of data that must be provided, many schemes and encryption algorithms have been implemented, but most of those schemes have high computational costs and overload on the data owner. In this paper, we are proposing a hierarchy-based privacy preserving access control scheme, in which data is encrypted and decrypted by the cloud using the blinded encryption and decryption technique that retains the constant computation cost to the owner and the user for any large file size, thus it makes our scheme suitable for energy deficient devices. The experimental result shows that our scheme is more suitable for energy deficient devices without compromising the security of data.

This includes the provision of different level of abstraction, which allows the administrators to implement high level access policies, independent of low level infrastructures constituting the cloud services. In this paper, we define a secured access provision with effective role management (SAPERM) scheme, which provides a clear description of the algorithmic steps associated with system framework establishment and user access provision for cloud-based enterprises. The implementation of SAPERM scheme provides a clear mapping between the system entities solving the problems related to user revocation, delegation and user access provisions. We further deduce an effective algorithm for session scheduling and data archival that results in a highly secure and consistent system framework. The experimental implementation of SAPERM over Nova open stack cloud provides standard access provision and better system performance even at higher process threshold rate.

The major focus of this research paper deals with users more preferably e-learners using the proposed Recommendation system. The major objective in developing any Recommendation system is based on many factors like accuracy, preciseness and fast measures. Recommendations given to each user is based on his/her domain interest was time consuming in the past. This research paper deals with the development of a recommendation system which is based on accuracy and fastness measures. One of the factors for developing a fast recommendation system can be obtained by developing efficient algorithms for grouping the existing and the new users quickly so that further domain recommendations might be easier. The proposed framework is based on deep neural network, which proved to be an efficient algorithm for high dimensional data training and testing. The accuracy of the algorithm is justified by the generation of semantic hash codes generated from the users’ profile information and the subsequent hamming distance computation. The fast and the accuracy measures of the framework is justified and the experimental results are promising. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Deep neural network; Hamming distance; Recommendation systems; Semantic hash codes; Users","Clustering algorithms; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Hamming distance; Hash functions; Semantics; Accuracy measures; Hamming distance computation; High dimensional data; Information technology application; Research papers; Text document; Training and testing; Users; Recommender systems","Karthika, R.; University College of Engineering TindivanamIndia; email: karti.rn@gmail.com","Wang G.Yan Z.Choo K.K.R.Atiquzzaman M.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319723945,,,"English","Lect.

Test patterns are produced with desired levels of toggling and improved fault coverage is obtained when compared with BIST-based pseudorandom pattern generators (PRPG). The pattern generator comprises of a pseudorandom pattern generation unit, a toggle generation and control unit, a hold register unit. Preselected toggling (PRESTO) generator allows user defined levels of toggling. The pattern generator is a linear finite state machine which drives a phase shifter, which reduces correlation of patterns. This paper proposes a test compression method which elevates the compression efficiency that has not been obtained by conventional compression techniques. It does not need any core logic modifications like test point insertion and thus the compression technique is nonintrusive. This hybrid technique of BIST along with test compression achieves fault coverage above 90%. Experimental results are obtained for ISCAS 85, ISCAS 89 and ITC 99 standard benchmark circuits.

In this paper, a sensorless space vector modulation-based direct torque and indirect flux control of BLDC has been investigated. There are several methods that are projected for BLDC to gain better torque and current control, i.e., with minimum torque and current pulsations. The proposed sensorless method is similar to the usual direct torque control method which is utilized for sinusoidal alternating current motors so that it controls toque directly and stator flux indirectly by varying direct axis current. And the electric rotor position can be found by using winding inductance and stationary reference frame stator fluxes and currents. In this paper, space vector modulation technique is utilized which permits the regulation of varying signals than that of PWM and vector control techniques. The validity of the projected sensorless three-phase conduction direct torque control of BLDC motor drive method is established in the Simulink, and the results are observed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","BLDC; Direct torque and indirect flux controller; SVM technique","AC motors; Artificial intelligence; Controllers; Data mining; DC motors; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric machine control; Electric motors; Electric windings; Modulation; Pulse width modulation; Sensorless control; Stators; Torque; Torque control; Vector control (Electric machinery); Vector spaces; Alternating current motors; BLDC; Direct torque control methods; Flux controllers; Stationary reference frames; SVM technique; Three phase conductions; Vector control techniques; Brushless DC motors","Chandra Sekhar, G.T.; Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sri Sivani College of EngineeringIndia; email: gtchsekhar@gmail.com","Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811038730,,,"English","Adv.

Since the distributed nature of clouds is achieved through internetworking technologies, clouds suffer from all the vulnerabilities by which networking also suffers. In essence, data stored in clouds are vulnerable to attacks from intruders. But, no single technique can provide efficient intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose fuzzy self-classifying clustering based cloud intrusion detection system which is intelligent to gain knowledge of fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules from data to detect intrusions in a cloud environment. Its efficiency is explained by comparing with other three cloud intrusion detection systems.

The maintenance and operations of their services have become easier and cost effective. Data processing services are one among the major and important component in IT services, since IT functions progress around data processing. In particular privacy and security of user's data brings many challenges that have not been effectively addressed. A specific problem occurs when clients outsource their files (contains data) to the cloud storage server and the services are offered by cloud service provider (CSP), which is an untrusted entity. In this paper we introduce an Index Table Structure (ITS) based public auditing scheme to verify the integrity of the data stored in a cloud. Previous work requires CSP to store and maintain the data property information needed for auditing. In our approach we keep the data auditing information in trusted third party auditor (TTPA), results in reducing communication overhead and computational cost. Our method is a public auditing scheme based on ITS with TTPA, who performs auditing on behalf of the user. We extend our work to support privacy preserving property by signing the proof generated by cloud server during verification process. Thus, the result shows our proposed scheme is secure and provide with better efficiency.","Fuzzy decision tree; Performance; Prioritization; Queuing model; Scheduling","Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Data privacy; Decision trees; Distributed database systems; Network security; Queueing theory; Scheduling; Cloud service providers; Communication overheads; Fuzzy decision trees; Maintenance and operation; Performance; Prioritization; Queuing models; Trusted third parties; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Information Science",10162364,,JINEE,,"English","J.

This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for efficient retrieval of data from huge datasets using combined approach of clustering and frequent pattern analysis using maximum frequent transaction (MFT) set algorithm based on similarity of transactions provided by a novel data structure called Bloomier matrix filter (BMF). In the proposed model clustering the metadata file is done on two levels. The first level of cluster is a base cluster which is created in an offline mode, while uploading the data based on keyword using tf-idf and second level of cluster is a derived cluster which is created in an online mode, while downloading the data. Frequent transactions are generated based on the run time statistics of the transaction provided by the Bloomier matrix filter analysis. Based on the run time statistics of the BMF the dynamic cluster is derived. We have implemented the model in a cloud environment and the experimental results shows that our approach is more efficient than the existing search technology and increases throughput by handling more number of queries efficiently with reduced latency.

We propose an authorship attribution scheme by training author data using Convolutional Neural Network pretrained on personality data and combines the features obtained from this model with the features obtained from another CNN architecture for tone analysis proposed by us. These features are combined together with hand crafted features pertaining to the stylistic aspects of the author and an SVM is trained on these feature combination. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work employing tone based and personality based features for attributing authorship. The new approach paves way for a fool proof authorship analysis mechanism that can be employed to curb security issues like hacked account.

In such a large repository of compressed documents, the frequently used operations like keyword searching and document retrieval have to be carried out after decompression and subsequently with the help of an OCR. Therefore developing keyword spotting technique directly in compressed documents is a potential and challenging research issue. In this backdrop, the paper presents a novel approach for searching keywords directly in run-length compressed documents without going through the stages of decompression and OCRing. The proposed method extracts simple and straightforward font size invariant features like number of run transitions and correlation of runs over the selected regions of test words, and matches with that of the user queried word. In the subsequent step, based on the matching score, the keywords are spotted in the compressed document. The idea of decompression-less and OCR-less word spotting directly in compressed documents is the major contribution of this paper. The method is experimented on a data set of compressed documents and the preliminary results obtained validate the proposed idea. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Compressed document keyword spotting; Compressed image processing; Correlation-entropy analysis; Run-length compressed domain","Computer vision; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Government data processing; Image processing; Compressed domain; Compressed images; Document Retrieval; Entropy analysis; Internet application; Keyword searching; Keyword spotting; Transfer efficiency; Image compression","Chaudhuri, B.B.; Department of Studies in Computer Science, University of MysoreIndia; email: bbc@isical.ac.in","Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811021039,,,"English","Adv.

The researcher of Cloud working on their own to deal with this issue but in most of the research proposal consider client side security related issues i.e. Integrity checking, Authentication, Versioning etc. At other side some Research model gives more importance to security data related issue of Cloud service provider i.e. Database encryption, Security based on Metadata, Data Obfuscation etc. But both of above fundamental not make strong impact for Cloud users and Service providers. To have achieve best of them here in this paper we presented a model with two techniques that’s Data Obfuscation for server side to secure database details from outsiders and Encryption, authentication at client side. In this paper we have discussed implemented and testing of model towards performance and security. The proposed model ensures both users and service providers to bind trust on each other. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cloud storage; Confidentiality; Data protection; Encryption; Integrity; Obfuscation","Authentication; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Security of data; Client-side securities; Cloud environments; Cloud service providers; Cloud storages; Confidentiality; Database encryption; Integrity; Obfuscation; Cryptography","Suthar, K.; Computer Engineering Department, Rai UniversityIndia; email: krunal_bece@yahoo.co.in","Modi N.Verma P.Trivedi B.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811027499,,,"English","Adv.

In the last few decades, the advancements in internet technologies results in enormous increase in the dimensionality of the dataset concerned with data mining. Feature selection is an important dimensionality reduction technique as it improves accuracy, efficiency and model interpretability of data mining algorithms. Selection of feature and its stability may be perceived to be the robustness of the algorithm for feature selection which helps selecting similar or the same subset of features for small perturbations in the dataset. The essential purpose of data mining that is used for the preservation of privacy is the modification of original datasets by means of a method to preserve privacy of the individuals and work out subsequent data mining algorithm to get information from it. This perturbation of the dataset will affect the feature selection stability. There will be a correlation between privacy preserving data mining and feature selection stability. This paper explores on this problem and also introduces a privacy preserving algorithm which has less impact on feature selection stability as well as accuracy. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Data mining; Feature selection; Kuncheva Index; Privacy preservation; Selection stability","Data privacy; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Stability; Data mining algorithm; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Feature selection stabilities; Internet technology; Kuncheva Index; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving data mining; Privacy-preserving data mining algorithms; Data mining","Mohana Chelvan, P.; Department of Computer Science, Hindustan College of Arts and ScienceIndia; email: pmohanselvan@rediff.com","Luhach A.K.Raman B.Singh D.Lingras P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811057793,,,"English","Commun.

It enables the tenant user to deploy their infrastructure without any investment. Cloud storage offers flexibility with storage and sharing facilities using the Internet platform. Storing sensitive information such as clinical data requires high privacy preservation and is associated with serious concern over data privacy on the cloud platform. Privacy preservation becomes the most adherent issue when a large volume of data is stored in public clouds. Subtree anonymization using the bottom-up generalization (BUG) and top-down specialization (TDS) approaches has been widely adopted for anonymizing data sets. This ensures individual data privacy; however, it causes potential violations when the new update is received, and it suffers from valuing the k-anonymity parameter. In this proposed model, a pseudo-identity was anticipated to accomplish privacy preservation with maximum data utility on incremental data sets. Initially, the Data Set (DS) was partitioned in the preprocessing stage; subsequently, the processed data sets were clustered into groups. The genetic model was used for indexing and updating incremental data sets. This was consistent with repeatedly modified data sets. In the evaluation process, an incremental and distributed DS was deployed, and our model exhibited efficient and optimal performance for privacy preservation in comparison with existing models. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

In such applications, resources such as data, are sensitive in nature and it is necessary that only authorized users are allowed access without the presence of on-line monitoring system. The de-facto approach is to encrypt a shared resource and deploy a key distribution mechanism, which enables only authorized users to generate the respective decryption key for the resource. The key distribution approach has two major challenges: first, the applications are dynamic i.e., users might join and leave arbitrarily, and second, for a large number of users, it is required that the cryptographic technique be scalable and efficient. In this work, we describe an approach that overcomes these challenges by using two key techniques: first, flattening the access structure and applying efficient symmetric key distribution techniques. By flattening the access structure, we reduce the problem to that of key distribution of a resource among all the users sharing that resource. We consider this smaller flattened access structure and devise a unified key distribution technique that is sufficient for key distribution across all such structures. Our key distribution techniques have an important feature of a public secret and a private secret, which allows the group controller to publish updates to the keying material using the public secret and therefore, does not necessitate the users to be in constant communication with the group controller. Using this model we describe two efficient key distribution techniques that scale logarithmically with the group size and also handle group additions and removals. Furthermore, a user can be off-line for any amount of time and need not be aware of the dynamics of the system, which is important as it overcomes the problems posed by lossy channels. We have performed an experimental evaluation of our scheme against a popular existing scheme and show that they perform better for this scheme with the same security guarantees. As our approaches are easy to implement they are especially suitable for practical applications where security is viewed as an overhead rather than as a necessity. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,"Cryptography; Digital storage; Collaborative Editing; Cryptographic techniques; Distributed applications; Experimental evaluation; Group controllers; Important features; Key distribution; On-line monitoring system; Distributed computer systems","Bezawada, B.; Mahindra Ecole CentraleIndia; email: bru@mechyd.ac.in","Martinez Perez G.Gomez Marmol F.Thampi S.M.Westphall C.B.Fan C.I.Hu J.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811068973,,,"English","Commun.

Such data are preferably archived and transmitted in the compressed form to realize storage and transmission efficiency. Through compression, though data becomes storage and transmission efficient, its processing gets expensive as it requires decompression as many times the data needs to be processed; and this requires additional computing resources. Therefore it would be novel, if the data processing and information extraction could be carried out directly from the compressed data without subjecting it to decompression. In this backdrop, the research paper demonstrates a novel technique of extracting text and non-text information straight from compressed document images (supported by TIFF and PDF formats) using the correlation-entropy features that are directly computed from the compressed representation. The experimental results reported on compressed printed text document images validate the proposed method, and also demonstrate the fact that the text and non-text information extracted from the compressed document are identical to that obtained from uncompressed representation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Compressed document processing; Correlation-entropy; Run-length compresseddomain; Text and non-text","Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Entropy; Image processing; Information analysis; Intelligent systems; Automatic extraction; Compressed datum; Compressed domain; Computing resource; Document-processing; Novel techniques; Text and non-text; Transmission efficiency; Image compression","Javed, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NMAM Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: javedsolutions@gmail.com","Mezzour G.Alimi A.M.Rokbani N.Abraham A.Muda A.K.Haqiq A.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9783319529400,,,"English","Adv.

A key characteristics of distributed storage is that data are stored in remote servers across a network. Thus, network resources especially communication links are an expensive and non-trivial resource which should be optimized as well. In this paper, we present a simulation based study of the network characteristics of a distributed storage network in the light of several allocation patterns. By varying the allocation patterns we have demonstrated the interdependence between network bandwidth, defined in terms of link capacity and allocation pattern using network throughput as a metric. Recognizing the importance of network resources as an important cost metric, we intend to solve an optimization problem based on minimizing both the storage cost and the cost of network resources. The results of this optimization problem will determine how both storage and network optimization can be performed jointly so that a highly robust yet cost effective storage solution could be developed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Distributed storage allocation; Genetic algorithm; Network and storage optimized storage system","Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data storage equipment; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Problem solving; Cost-effective storages; Distributed storage; Distributed storage networks; Intelligent modeling; Network characteristics; Network optimization; Optimization problems; Storage systems; Digital storage","Chattopadhyay, S.; Department of Information Technology, Jadavpur UniversityIndia; email: samirancju@gmail.com","Mandal J.K.Dutta P.Mukhopadhyay S.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9789811064296,,,"English","Commun.

Omni wheeled based robots have omni directional drive capacity. Conventional localization technique like odometry is not suitable for such drives due to wheel slippage. An omni robot platform with 4 omni-directional wheels powered by dynamixel motor and a scanning platform has been developed. We have implemented a localization technique using camera as visual sensor and multiple markers based on 'ArToolKiT' an augmented reality application. Various camera related distortion were reduced using 2nd order surface fit of camera calibration data. To increase the accuracy of the system, fusion of results from multiple markers has been implemented. Performance of the proposed localization has been verified by studying different pattern based movement of the system in a test area of 5m X 5m.

In order to fully exploit the advantages of modern GDi injector, the electronic system should be capable of driving a high speed solenoid injector at a very fast switching frequency efficiently and with less power consumption. The electric driving circuit is required to be designed with a fast response and precise control. The most serious problem which decreases the injector performance is the response time delay of the injector. There are many reasons for the delay in opening and closing of electromechanical injector such as voltage drop, limitation of injector driving circuit, electromagnetic interference, etc. In this paper, an injector drive circuit has been designed and analyzed for driving a high pressure injector. Also, PWM control using NE 555 timer has been introduced for quickening the cut-off response time. In the process of designing an injector drive circuit high frequency switching component like MOSFET, IGBT and power transistor has been used. Comparison of response time between these three injector driving circuit has been given using NI Multisim. Analysis of switching characteristic among the three injector driving circuit was carried out. In the end, switching characteristic and temperature sweep of all the three IDC have been plotted. © 2016 IEEE.","Injector; injector characteristic; Injector driver circuit; power electronics; PWM control","Actuators; Air engines; Delay circuits; Delay control systems; Diesel engines; Electromagnetic pulse; Engines; Power electronics; Solenoid valves; Solenoids; Switching; Timing circuits; Driver circuit; Electronic actuators; Fast switching frequency; High-frequency switching; Injector; injector characteristic; PWM control; Switching characteristics; Electric network analysis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509028078,,,"English","Int.

Deduplication is an effective data reduction technique to minimize the storage cost as well as communication cost. However, Deduplication raises significant security issues. Malicious users and semi-trusted Storage Server tries to learn the data outsourced by other users. Encrypting the data at user side before uploading to Storage Server is essential for protecting outsourced data. However, conventional deterministic encryption techniques are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks for predictable files. In this paper, we propose secure random key based encryption technique for Deduplicated Storage. In our approach, user encrypts the file with a randomly chosen key. Random key is encrypted by set of hash values generated from plaintext file. In this way, our approach provides protection against brute-force attack and dictionary attack. We analyze security of our approach with theoretical proof and experimental analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Computer crime; Digital storage; Information systems; Brute-force attack; Communication cost; Deterministic encryptions; Dictionary attack; Encryption technique; Experimental analysis; Outsourced datum; Reduction techniques; Cryptography","Dave, J.; Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: jaydaveadms@gmail.com","Vaidya J.Shyamasundar R.K.Singh V.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319725970,,,"English","Lect.

The collection of traffic data using multiple sensors and other capture devices have been addressed in multiple researches deploying the mechanism using geodetically static sensor agents. However, the sheath factors for the parallel research outcomes have significantly ignored the fact of data replication control during processing. This work proposes a novel framework for capturing and storing traffic data. During the multi-node traffic data analysis, controlling the replication in order to reduce the cost has also been a challenge. Recent research outcomes demonstrate the use of agent-based sensor networks to accumulate road traffic data. However, a multipurpose framework for accumulating and managing the traffic data is still a demand. The outcomes of this research is also to consider the most effective cloud-based storage for the traffic data with the knowledge of most popular cloud-based storage service providers. The accumulation of the data is also followed by the predictive system for road traffic data analysis. Hence in this work we also explore the use of standard machine learning techniques to identify the most suitable technique with performance consideration.

A delay-tolerant network suffers from nodes energy efficiency issues due to frequent mobility and reliable transmission of data packet from source to destination. Due to the mobility of the node there are frequent changes in the path. Due to which enormous amount of energy is wasted. So to conserve the energy of the node energy efficient transmission from one node to another node can be achieved by using the proposed algorithm EADBNHS. Connectivity of the network can be determined by Synchronism, Simultaneousness and Discontinuity using EADBNHS. EADBNHS is the algorithm devised for energy efficiency in this article. To achieve energy efficiency of a node the algorithm is designed in a way, which includes transmission energy, reception energy and the health of the node. This algorithm supports energy efficient transfer of data packet; it selects a node on the basis of minimum energy available on the node and on the basis of its connectivity to other nodes. With the help of Synchronicity, Simultaneousness and Discontinuity we can easily judge a node’s condition to become the participant node in the path from source to destination. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Delay tolerant networks; Destination node; Energy efficiency; Mandatory storage; Network lifetime; Quality of service; Source node","Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Quality of service; Routers; Wireless networks; Delaytolerant networks (DTNs); Destination nodes; Energy efficient; Mobile wireless network; Network lifetime; Reliable transmission; Source nodes; Transmission energy; Delay tolerant networks","Kumar, R.; Department of CSE, Chandigarh University, Gharaun, India; email: rohitbhullar@gmail.com","Singh V.K.Tiwari S.Mishra K.K.Bhatia S.K.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811037696,,,"English","Adv.

Ad hoc is Latin and means “for this” (i.e., for this purpose). The nodes also act as router. Routing is an important aspect of MANETs which is used to find the route which can be used for communication. Traditionally, routing protocols were focused on performance only. But security is also an important aspect. Due to limited bandwidth, limited storage capacity, dynamic topology, shared medium, open peer-to-peer communication, security in MANETs is difficult to implement compared to wired networks. There are number of attacks on routing protocols like routing table overflow attack, black hole attack, wormhole attack, route cache poisoning, sybill attack, modification, fabrication, location spoofing attacks, etc., which affect the functioning of MANETs and degrade the performance. So, there is need to secure routing protocols so that their functioning is not affected and performance is not degraded due to these attacks. A new way of detection and prevention of wormhole attack is proposed in this paper. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is converted into multipath routing protocol by changing the way intermediate node forwards the route request packet. The QualNet 5.0.2 simulator [1] is used to validate the proposed approach. Two new packets Dummy_Request and Dummy_Reply are introduced to check the vulnerability of the path. The format of these packets is same as route reply except the option type. The performance parameters used are packet delivery ratio and throughput. The results show that packet delivery ratio and throughput under wormhole attack is less compared to protocol without wormhole attack and theMultipath Routing Wormhole Detection and Prevention Protocol (MRWDPP) improves performance under wormhole attack. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","AODV; DSR; MANETs; Split multipath routing; Wormhole","Ad hoc networks; Computer crime; Digital storage; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; AODV; Infrastructure-less networks; MANETs; Multipath routing protocols; Peer-to-peer communications; Secure routing protocols; Split multipath routing; Wormhole; Mobile ad hoc networks","Ahuja, R.; Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Sector-128, India; email: ravinder.ahuja@jiit.ac.in","Bhateja V.Satapathy S.C.Joshi A.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9789811016776,,,"English","Adv.

Emerging Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (MCC-WMSNs) help to work efficiently with these multimedia applications. The advantage of integrating MCC with WMSNs is that the data gathered by sensor nodes can be accessible from anywhere and at anytime by the users. In this context, there exists several issues such as battery life of the multimedia sensors, processing power, and storage etc. To solve these problems, in this work a MCC-WMSNs integration technique is proposed by using a cloudlets based integration algorithm named as CLIW which mainly works with CLIW-1 and CLIW-2 schemes where both the schemes focus on minimizing energy consumption. The simulation results indicate that CLIW-1 and CLIW-2 schemes are able to prolong the network lifetime of integrated WMSNs. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","MCC; Multimedia applications; Network lifetime; WMSNs","Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Integration; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Integration algorithm; Integration approach; Integration techniques; Minimizing energy; Multimedia applications; Network lifetime; Wireless multimedia sensor network; WMSNs; Mobile cloud computing","Sarkar, J.L.; Department of Computer Science, Central University of RajasthanIndia; email: joylalsarkar@gmail.com","Prasath R.Gelbukh A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319581293,,,"English","Lect.

Enterprise needs to entrust untrusted cloud service provider, which gives rise to various security and privacy concerns. To address these concerns, numerous schemes in cloud computing employed attribute-based encryption schemes. However, existing schemes are neither flexible enough to provide users complete liberty on delegation of their access privileges nor grant shared access privileges among users of a group to jointly address a responsibility. This paper introduces hierarchical attribute-set-based access control scheme by employing ciphertext-policy attribute-set-based encryption with a hierarchical structure of users to achieve scalability. The proposed scheme simultaneously achieves the notion of fine-grained cum flexible access control, privacy preserving, efficient data utilization and imperatively provides users full-fledged liberty on delegation of their access privileges.

In order to promote the exchange of data among systems (and organizations), standards are being adopted for data exchange. Further, the clinics and hospitals aim to manage a patient’s life-time history of records. A piece of the individual patient’s medical record can be captured, stored, queried, and shared over a network through enrichment in information technology. Thus, electronic health records (EHRs) are being standardized for incorporating semantic interoperability. In addition, a generic storage structure is required to capture distinguished data requirements of various organizations. The generic structure must be capable of dealing with sparseness and frequent evolution behavior of EHRs. A subsequent step requires that healthcare professionals and patients get to use the EHRs, with the help of technological developments, such as workflow toolkits and new (easy) query languages. The goal is to present an overview of different approaches in understanding some current and challenging concepts in e-health informatics. Successful handling of these challenges will lead to improved quality in healthcare by reducing medical errors, decreasing costs, and enhancing patient care. The report is focused on the following objectives: (1) understanding the role of EHRs Databases; (2) understanding the need for standardization to enhance quality; (3) establishing interoperability in maintaining EHRs; (4) explicating a framework for standardization and interoperability (the openEHR architecture); (5) exploring various data models for managing EHRs; and (6) understanding the difficulties in querying data in EHR and e-health systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Big data; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Health; Health care; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Medical computing; Network architecture; Query languages; Records management; Semantics; Standardization; Electronic health record; Electronic health record (EHRs); Evolution behavior; Generic structure; Health care professionals; Semantic interoperability; Storage structures; Technological development; Interoperability","Sachdeva, S.; Department of Computer Science and IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology UniversityIndia; email: sachdevashelly1@gmail.com","Sureka A.Chakravarthy S.Reddy P.K.Bhalla S.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319724126,,,"English","Lect.

Standards for semantic interoperability propose the use of archetypes for building a health application. A usual practice followed for storing of EHRs is through graphical user interfaces. Generally, user interface is static corresponding to the underlying medical concept, often made manually and are prone to errors. However, evolution in knowledge demands for dynamically generated user interfaces to reduce time, minimize cost and enhance reliability. Current research implements mobile app for standardized Electronic Health Records Database termed as HEALTHSURANCE. The application maintains its dynamic behavior through creation of graphical user interfaces at runtime by gaining knowledge from the artefacts (known as archetypes) available from standard clinical repositories (such as Clinical Knowledge Manager). This provides easy and hassle-free user operability without any need of mobile developer. A standardized format and content helps to uplift the credibility of data and maintains a uniform and specific set of constraints used to evaluate the user’s health. A generic centralized database is chosen for data storage to support evolution in clinical knowledge and to handle heterogeneity of EHRs data. Implementing mobile app based on archetype paradigm avoids reimplementation of systems, migrating databases and allows the creation of future-proof systems. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Clinical information system; Electronic health records databases; Mobile application; Standardization; User interface","Database systems; Digital storage; Graphical user interfaces; Health; Health care; Information management; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Records management; Semantics; Standardization; Centralized data-base; Clinical information system; Clinical knowledge; Dynamic behaviors; Electronic health record; Electronic health record (EHRs); Mobile applications; Semantic interoperability; User interfaces","Sachdeva, S.; Jaypee Institute of Information Technology UniversityIndia; email: sachdevashelly1@gmail.com","Begoli E.Luo G.Wang F.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319671857,,,"English","Lect.

In IoT, various smart objects (smart sensors, embedded devices, PDAs, and smartphones) share their data with one another irrespective of their geographical locations using the Internet. The amount of data generated by these connected smart objects will be on the order of zettabytes in the coming years. This huge amount of data creates challenges with respect to storage and analytics given the resource constraints of these smart devices. Additionally, to process the large volume of information generated, the traditional cloud-based infrastructure may lead to long response time and higher bandwidth consumption. To cope up with these challenges, a new powerful technology, edge computing, promises to support data processing and service availability to end users at the edge of the network. However, the integration of IoT and edge computing is still in its infancy. Task scheduling will play a pivotal role in this integrated architecture. To handle all the above mentioned issues, we present a novel architecture for task selection and scheduling at the edge of the network using container-as-a-service (CoaaS). We solve the problem of task selection and scheduling by using cooperative game theory. For this purpose, we developed a multi-objective function in order to reduce the energy consumption and makespan by considering different constraints such as memory, CPU, and the user's budget. We also present a real-time internal and external container migration technique for minimizing the energy consumption. For task selection and scheduling, we have used lightweight containers instead of the conventional virtual machines to reduce the overhead and response time as well as the overall energy consumption of fog devices, that is, nano data centers (nDCs). Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the energy consumption and the average number of SLA violations by 21.75 and 11.82 percent, respectively. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Computation theory; Containers; Data handling; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Game theory; Human computer interaction; Internet of things; Nanosensors; Network architecture; Scheduling; Bandwidth consumption; Cooperative game theory; Geographical locations; Integrated architecture; Migration technique; Multi-objective functions; Resource Constraint; Service availability; Green computing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15361284,,IWCEA,,"English","IEEE Wirel.

Embedded NVM provides better security, SOC specific customization, and better integration to other SOC components. It also interacts with many critical modules, like Power Management Controller (PMC), Reset-sequencing State control machine, etc.; while also playing a very important role in power-up sequencing and mode transitions of the chip, since it contains the analog trimming, firmware and final customer application code. The NVM is a big complex component containing Digital and Analog sections, along with Bitcell Arrays and multiplexers. Once integrated in a SOC, it is quite important to check proper functioning of SOC and NVM across power-up and low-power-mode transitions. At present, NVM verification at IP level is done in parts, with individual sub-modules tested separately and limited verification of complete NVM IP after its sub-modules modules are stitched together. At SOC level, verification is done using behavioral model of NVM, which again loses electrical aspect of the signals. Thus mixed-mode simulations at SOC-level are needed for NVM. But, taking the entire NVM-Array in SPICE is an un-necessary load of millions of MOSFETs on the simulator, and beyond the capacity of many tools. The repeated memory-bank-structures do contain a lot of analog circuitry, and optimized techniques can allow for a simulation friendly design-size. We have developed method to model the NVM which allow us to run Chip-level simulations with a SPICE & Verilog-A/AMS views of the NVM.

But, though cloud is a viable present day option for elastic storage facilities, its security is still a grave concern. Hence, in order to improve the secure communication among group members, Zhu and Jiang have proposed a protocol and claimed that key distribution to the group users can be done without any secure communication channels. They have claimed that their scheme is resistant to collusion attack and all the other attacks, thereby ensuring forward and backward secrecies as well. Firstly, in this research work, after extensive analysis, we have identified several issues in the protocol proposed by Zhu and Jiang which make it vulnerable to various attacks. Secondly, we have proved that an attacker can use the man-in-the-middle attack and break the protocol thereby getting the secret keys shared between the group manager and the group user. Thirdly, we have given enough proof that the scheme is vulnerable to message modification attack too. Finally, we claim that the earlier proposed protocol is not secure and a new protocol with improved security is the need of the hour. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cloud storage; Key distribution; Man-in-the-middle attack; Mobile user; Security","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Secure communication; Cloud storages; Key distribution; Man in the middle attacks; Mobile users; Security; Network security","Milton Ganesh, S.; University College of Engineering Tindivanam, Melpakkam, India; email: softengineermilton@gmail.com","Wang G.Yan Z.Choo K.K.R.Atiquzzaman M.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319723945,,,"English","Lect.

This data is further used by decision making systems to infer a patient's condition and possibly to motivate a patient to follow a healthy lifestyle by using persuasive system approach. The implementation and maintenance of such systems require specific attention of software engineers for data management because of the complexity involved in the management of various data sources and privacy-related issues of personal data. In this paper, we propose a data model that is generic enough to describe and to support many kinds of telemonitoring applications. These applications include data mining applications which analyse and combine sensor data for a decision making, and persuasive systems which motivate a patient to follow a healthy lifestyle. We show that our data model is useful for a smooth management of data mining outputs and that it avoids the integration efforts in dealing with heterogeneous storage mechanisms. We also show that our data model eases the management of the granularity of data and that it facilitates software designers' tasks for the implementation of privacy protection mechanisms.

This introduces significant ripple on its DC bus voltage, and in the input DC source current. These are normally filtered out by placing a bulk capacitor in the DC bus, which affects the power density. Two novel schemes and control methods are presented, which help reduce the input ripple current considerably, while using a comparatively low-valued DC bus capacitor. These also help improve the power density and reliability of the inverter by reducing the size of the DC bus capacitor. Comparative analysis of the proposed schemes versus legacy schemes is presented. The proposed methods are verified by simulation and experimentation. The results show a significant reduction in peak-to peak ripple at the input. The concept was used and tested in the Little Box Challenge 2kW inverter prototype. Experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed active filters and control methods. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.",,"Energy management; Intelligent robots; Power electronics; Bulk capacitors; Comparative analysis; Control methods; Filtering schemes; Full-bridge inverters; Output frequency; Power densities; Ripple currents; Electric inverters",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9783800744244,,,"English","PCIM Europe - Int.

Such devices have also continued to increase in capability over recent years, ranging in complexity from embedded resources (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards) placed alongside data capture devices to more complex “micro data centres”. Using such resources, a user is able to carry out task execution and data storage in proximity to their location, often making use of computing resources that can have varying ownership and access rights. Increasing performance requirements for stream processing applications (for instance), which incur delays between the client and the cloud have led to newer models of computation, which requires an application workflow to be split across data centre and edge resource capabilities. With recent emergence of edge/fog computing it has become possible to migrate services to micro-data centres and to address the performance limitations of traditional (centralised data centre) cloud based applications. Such migration can be represented as a cost function that involves incentives for micro-data centres to host services with associated quality of services and experience. Business models need to be developed for creating an open edge cloud environment where micro-data centres have the right incentives to support service hosting, and for large scale data centre operators to outsource service execution to such micro data centres. We describe potential revenue models for micro-data centers to support service migration and serve incoming requests for edge based applications. We present several cost models which involve combined use of edge devices and centralised data centres. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Business models; Cost; Edge computing; Micro-data centres; Resource sharing","Cost functions; Costs; Distributed computer systems; Economics; Business models; Cloud-based applications; Data centres; Edge computing; Models of computation; Performance limitations; Performance requirements; Resource sharing; Digital storage","Petri, I.; School of Engineering, Cardiff UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: petrii@cardiff.ac.uk","Banares J.A.Pham C.Altmann J.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319680651,,,"English","Lect.
