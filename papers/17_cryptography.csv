The cloud computing fulfills the need of store and oversee show. Though to get to and secure information, numerous exceptional advancements like parallel and guide diminish strategies are accessible. The burden of usage from maintenance and storage of native data is eliminated and the owner additionally benefits from elimination of the responsibility of security and storage (Gourkhede and Theng, 2014 fourth international conference on communication systems and network technologies (CSNT), pp 677–680, 2014; Modi, J Supercomput 63(2):561–592, 2013; Smys and Bala, Clust Comput 15(3):211–222, 2012). In order to ensure modification of the accuracy of the on-demand data and its due verification on the cloud owners’ behalf, a methodology that is innovative is needed. The encryption and file split up is done using a novel secure cryptography hashing algorithm. Once the data is uploaded the user is provided with a private and public key for trustworthy retrieval of the data file. Those keys are generated using a proposed modified RSA cryptosystem algorithm. A multilevel hash tree algorithm is used to efficiently audit the data file occasionally.

The VHO model is developed in such a way that multiple parameters are used in every stage which includes selection of candidate networks during discovery, mathematical based decision making and authenticated execution.

This forms a region based cluster protocol. Security is handled in an effective way through digital signature technique namely EdDSA and projective geometry. This paper concentrates on applying the intelligent security algorithm over the group controller in a distributed environment.

We replace least significant bits from enveloped image with the bits of original image at the time of LSB based image steganography. This approach is not as secured as retrieving the least significant bits from the enveloped image will provide all the information of original image. So in the proposed system, we rearrange all the pixels of the original and the enveloped image using prime and non-prime positions of the pixels. Again we reposition all the pixels using one of the user defined pixel repositioning algorithms (PRONE (positional reverse odd normal even), PRENO (positional reverse even normal odd), CRENO (continuous reverse even normal odd), CRONE (continuous reverse odd normal even)) chosen by the user for original and enveloped image separately. Lastly we perform user defined BWMAS operation (Bitwise Masking & Alternate Sequence) between the bits of original image and the least significant bits of the enveloped image. As all the pixels of both enveloped and original images are repositioned, so the pixels from original image are chosen actually in non sequential manner and the pixels, taken from enveloped image for BWMAS operation are also in non sequential manner. Only the proper sequences of the encrypted pixels defined by the user defined algorithms are being able to retrieve the information of the original image. We introduce Bitwise Masking & Alternate Sequence operation for the first time in state of XOR operation. Thus an attempt is made to increase the security of the image encryption system. © 2017 IEEE.",Image Steganography; Pixel Repositioning Scheme; Prime/Non Prime pixel sequencing; User defined operator (BWMAS),Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Image processing; Steganography; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Image steganography; Least significant bits; Original images; Prime/Non Prime pixel sequencing; Sequential manners; User defined operator (BWMAS); Pixels,,Piuri V.Mukherjee A.Mondal A.Das A.Maulik U.Bhattacharjee D.Bhaumik H.Panigrahi B.K.Gandhi T.Bhattacharyya S.Pan I.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

While in cryptography, the goal is to make everything unreadable to the ones who do not know the password, in steganography, on the other hand, the goal is to camouflage a message inside an apparently innocent carrier. In other words, while cryptography conceals the message itself, steganography conceals the existence of the message. Since, this form of communication potentially attracts unsavoury people to secretly hide messages in plain sight, there have been many efforts on different fronts to detect the possibility of the existence of steganography in images and other multimedia objects. Most of such algorithms use different statistical analysis based attacks for detecting potential cases of steganography. In light of this, the present methodology demonstrates the development of a set of algorithms designed to implement a spatial domain steganography technique that is capable of withstanding such attacks.

In this technique, the encryption algorithm should be simple to design and implementation. In the proposed article, a novel color image encryption algorithm is presented employing a 4D Lorenz system. The encryption technique is very sensitive to the input 256 bits key and input plane image. Initially, the color image is split into three different channels R, G, and B. Next each channel is encrypted separately by employing diffusion and confusion mechanism. Finally, all three channels R, G, and B are combined to produce the required encrypted image.

But in recent years cyber-attacks are continuously developing, therefore security specialists must stay busy in the lab inventing new schemes to keep attackers at bay. Possible attacks on symmetric algorithm can be Brute-force Attack, Differential Attack, Algebraic Attack and Linear Attack.

This requires transmission of Electronic Patient Record (EPR), which is generally carried on a secured network. Despite all safety measures, the primary concern is privacy, security and confidentiality of patient information. Therefore, this paper proposes an invisible watermarking method of embedding EPR into the facial image. This is protected through a key generated by a novel Restoration & Bundle Encryption method using structural content of patient's bioelectric signal. The security evaluation carried out demonstrates that within a rational time, it is impossible to extract any information without the key. The embedded data and restored data is evaluated using block match process and feature extraction is carried out for each of the blocks.

Algorithm uses 400 bit key which is divided into 2 parts of 200-200 bits providing different keys for each rounds of cascading which will increase the security. Here AES-AES cascading is done which consist of 5 rounds instead of 10, thus it will omit the mix column twice from the original AES Encryption technique. Omitting mix column [3] single time reduce the complexity from 248 to 216. Hence, it takes half time than simple AES algorithm to encrypt the block data.

A strong encryption system is required to protect the data stored in android phones at a maximum level. Traditional encryption schemes have the disadvantage that communication overheads and the computation costs are too high. And also there is a possibility that the data is lost after encryption. Hence, it is necessary to implement a ""Data Encryption and Decryption"" scheme with ""Cloud Backup"" feature which is more efficient in order to provide high level of data security for android phones. It is necessary to create means which will enable a user to encrypt confidential data present in the mobile phones. Decrypt it to recover the encrypted data. In case of brute force attack, user need not worry about losing the data as ""Automatic encryption"" is triggered. ""Cloud Backup"" is another mechanism to prevent the data from being known by an adversary. This paper proposes an Android Application which will provide the features of automatic encryption, data encryption/decryption, and cloud backup all in one single mobile application. AES -256 bit algorithm is used for this purpose. The sole purpose of using AES for encryption/decryption is that it is secure and has high computational complexity.

Cryptanalysis is a process in which the security is attempted to breach and the complexity of this process is considered as security measurement. As cryptographic algorithm is open to all, the whole strength lies in the complexity of the key i.e. efforts to crack the key. Mostly the strength of the key is shown through its length, eventually the number of communication (Brute-force method). Genetic algorithms are considered to be a tool for meta heuristic applications. In this work an attempt is made to carry out cryptanalysis, through genetic algorithms. In this, mono-alphabetic substitution cipher technique is considered. The experiment is carried out for four key samples, and attempt to break with variations in genetic operators i.e. selection, crossover and mutation.

How to exploit security and surreptitious policies constitute a foremost challenge, notably when managing huge amount of distributed data? This paper suggested a framework for secure, insightful, and high-speed data storage and accessibility on big data platform. We present a Kerberos network authentication protocol to securely access the sensitive as well as clumsy data. The framework protects the security of owner's data effectively, shares it unwarily, and at the same time provides high-speed secure access to the data. © 2017 IEEE.",access control; annonymization; Big data; encryption; policy enforcement; security policy,Access control; Cryptography; Digital storage; Network security; annonymization; Big data platforms; Distributed data; Kerberos network; Policy enforcement; Security frameworks; Security policy; Third party datum; Big data,,Astya P.N.Gupta K.Sharma V.Swaroop A.Singh M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proceeding - IEEE Int.

When the train-borne antenna energizes them using tele-powering signals, balises backscatter preprogrammed telegrams, which carry information about the train's current location. Since the telegrams are static in the existing implementations, the uplink signals from the balises could be recorded by an adversary and then replayed at a different location of the track, leading to what is well-known as the replay attack. Such an attack, while the legitimate balise is still functional, introduces ambiguity to the train about its location, can impact the physical operations of the trains. For balise-to-train communication, we propose a new communication framework referred to as cryptographic random fountains (CRF), where each balise, instead of transmitting telegrams with fixed information, transmits telegrams containing random signals. A salient feature of CRF is the use of challenge-response based interaction between the train and the balise for communication integrity. We present a thorough security analysis of CRF to showcase its ability to mitigate sophisticated replay attacks. Finally, we also discuss the implementation aspects of our framework. © 2017 IEEE.",,Antennas; Control systems; Cryptography; Fountains; Location; Random processes; Telegraph; Challenge response; Communication framework; Communication integrity; Implementation aspects; Location information; Passive transponder; Security analysis; Train control systems; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"IEEE Conf.

It considered as one of the widely accepted technologies worldwide. During these days people to avoid the expense of IT infrastructure and maintenance they are started adopting the cloud services. When we choose cloud service security is most significant obstacle and data security is biggest hurdle in case of security. When data is store on servers it may store directly or with encryption of whole data. But we know data have different characteristics and needs so different security levels are required. So in this paper we review some classification algorithms to classify the data on basis of their different security needs. After classification which part required more security that can be encrypted by various cryptographic techniques and then store it over the cloud whereas other part can store directly without any encryption on cloud storage. For further security we can partition the cloud storage. And this will help us to overcome the security issue i.e. confidentiality and also save our efforts and time of encryption and uploading of data over data storage. It prevents the data leakage also because after classification hacker will also not able to know the starting and ending point of data and it will also difficult for him to hack multiple storage than single. This paper prevents the data leakage, hassle vogue menace to find position of data eventually difficult for attacker to hack multiple storage than single level security as used in conventional model. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud storage; Cloud-computing; Data encryption; Data-classification; Data-security,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Personal computing; Security of data; Classification algorithm; Cloud storages; Conventional modeling; Cryptographic techniques; Data classification; Data encryption; Emerging technologies; IT infrastructures; Classification (of information),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Images are extensively used in communications on due of various facts. But image security in communication remains an essential aim. Coloration in images are originated by different color models, which are discussed with their actual potentials. In this paper, different image usage and protecting practices are discussed with their annoyances. There exists multiple protecting methods, in general called as encryption. In complex image encryption algorithms the logical operations such as ExOR, carries trivial but an essential part. While being a powerful operator, ExOR is also very less in terms of time and space complexity. In this paper, Textimage Ciphering algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm gives the finest probable combination of all discussed techniques. Also it has less time and space complexity which makes it more practicable. The suggested tactic is different from traditional protecting techniques, it advocates encoding of an image by transforming it in text form. The encoded text is then send and on receiver side, its first decoded then converted to image form which resemblance the original image.

RSBPNDS operates by dividing the plaintext into number of blocks with fixed block cipher. A generating function is applied on source block and a target block is received. Combining the entire target block, the cipher text is generated. Block sizes of n-bits, total prime numbers and nonprime numbers are calculated in the range 0 to (2n ? 1). These prime-numbers and nonprime numbers are encoded with minimum number of bits, suppose the value of the block is 12 then there are six primes and six nonprimes, so number of minimum bits required to encode is three. Select each source block and calculate its value then map to prime number set and nonprime number set.

The execution time of full disk encryption in large servers is significant because of the computational complexity associated with disk encryption. Hence it is necessary to reduce the execution time of full disk encryption from the application point of view. In this work a full disk encryption algorithm namely EME2 AES (Encrypt Mix Encrypt V2 Advanced Encryption Standard) is analyzed. The execution speed of this algorithm is reduced by means of multicore compatible parallel implementation which makes use of available cores. Parallel implementation is executed on a multicore machine with 8 cores and speed up on the multicore implementation is measured.

There by, curious storage server need not get any partial information about the search query and stored encrypted data. There are a lots of existing techniques of searchable encryption scheme over the years. But, the practical significance of those techniques are not up to expectation. Nevertheless, it is an important tool regarding storing the data and retrieving from cloud server. For this, the scheme is gaining more attention in recent years. Searchable encryption was practically introduced by Boneh et al., who used asymmetric searchable encryption in their scheme. There are lots of techniques of searchable encryption based on single and multiple keyword search. The multiple keyword search was first attempted by Wang et al. However, the scheme has some drawbacks. Searchable encryption with patter obfuscation was introduced by Orencik et al. This scheme has also some shortcomings regarding security issues. In our work, we devised a searchable encryption scheme with pattern matching algorithm for multiple keywords. The scheme is designed with less space complexity and it also provides updating ranked search. We use the property of Trie data structure to reduce both the search and space complexity. Our scheme allows the ranked search with outcomes of most relevant top ranked documents which consists of the query keyword. Because of the Trie structure property, our scheme also deals with the update operation of files or documents flexibly. To ensure the privacy of the scheme, we include the fuzzy search trapdoor and exact search trapdoor here. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud server; Encryption; Fuzzy trapdoor; Pattern matching; Relevancy score; Secure search,Aluminum; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Pattern matching; Search engines; Cloud servers; Fuzzy trapdoor; Partial information; Pattern matching algorithms; Relevancy score; Searchable encryptions; Secure search; Trie data structures; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The Galoise fields GF(p) and GF(pn) are used in DLP based public key cryptography. The number field sieve and function field sieve are two popular methods to solve these hard problems. These methods involves two main phases such as pre computation and computation phases. The precomputation phase in turn consists of two steps such as relation collection and solving linear system of equations. The solving step is a big bottle neck in these methods. The popular methods used in this step are Lanczos and Wiedemann. The Lanczos is being used for long period of time in this step, recently Block Wiedemann is being used to solve in the field GF(2809) bits. Block Wiedemann started getting attention to solve DLP in higher field. In this paper the block Wiedemann method for solving DLP is investigated. The main motive of using Block Wiedemann method in higher field is analyzed. Also the performance of Block Wiedemann is critically analyzed on the sparsity of the matrix for solving DLP in one of the large sub group and the results are reported.

The gates inserted for the locking are called key-gates. To display its correct functionality (i.e. produces correct outputs), valid key has to be provided to the locked design. Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) is utilized to randomly generate the sequence of key values.

For a reliable encryption method any alteration in image content or the key must be reflected in the cipher image. The present work demonstrates a highly secure and reliable encryption of the color images using chaotic dynamical system augmented by pixel shuffling based on 3-D matrix, and further subjected to a diffusion process. This proposed model yields an average NPCR and UACI values of ? 99.6% and ? 33.34% respectively and nearly no correlation among neighbouring pixels which indicates a higher immunity towards attacks. The proposed model ensures information integrity during transmission which was further validated with a series of simulations e.g. entropy, noise addition, tampering and compression. Further, statistical analysis was also carried out using histogram analysis for different types of attacks.

To minimize these challenges, cryptographic concepts has been introduced. Cryptography is the art of technique that is used to changing the information in to unreadable format based on the user's key. Various cryptographic concepts have been introduced for text and image. Due to data redundancy and mass data capacity the text encryption methods are difficult to handle the image encryption. Image encryption is done by changing the position of the pixels in an image based on the key provided by the user. In the existing method, the image encryption is done by the magic rectangle method. It contains only one magic rectangle and if it is computed, the intruder can easily retrieve the original image. To overcome this, we proposed the Pan Magic Square encryption algorithm for the image to be encrypted. In PMS, the plain text image is partitioned into pixels. By user's key, 64 magic squares are generated. Then, encrypt the image based on the square values. The image is being encrypted by the PMS algorithm. The encrypted image is transmitted to the receiver. The receiver will decrypt the image by the reverse process of the encryption. The encrypted image provided by the algorithm is different from the plaintext image so we can securely transmit over the internet. After decryption, the resulting image provided by the proposed technique will be same as the original plaintext image. © 2017 IEEE.",Decryption; Encryption; Magic Square; permutation,Image processing; Number theory; Pixels; Cryptographic concepts; Decryption; Encrypted images; Encryption algorithms; Image encryptions; Magic square; permutation; Text encryptions; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The application of IoT in Healthcare system brings high value for the elderly, victims of chronic disease and those who require constant supervision. But there are many security issues in such application. Moreover, the medical devices used in the IoT enabled Healthcare System are resource constrained devices. So, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for authenticating such resource constrained medical devices.

These SoCs integrate multi-core processor (i.e., ARM Cortex9 or A15) with variety of memory interface controllers, communication interface controllers and special purpose accelerators. Traditionally bus matrix is used for integrating these intellectual properties - cores (IPs). Bus based architectures are not scalable and consume more area and power, which has fueled design of network on chip (NOC). A customized NOC is further more efficient. In this paper, a methodology for customized NOC architecture is introduced considering various aspects of NOC as well as the SoC. Policies for optimizing Bandwidth requirement, size of the IP (area or gate count), lP location for optimum path lengths are discussed. Policies in turn form methodology for optimum NOC. As IPs in SOC increase in numbers, NOC for interconnecting every IP may result in over networking. Sometimes, performance of router is under utilized. On the other hand, for closely coupled IPs direct port to port connections are suitable than NOC as they communicate heavily. IPs which talk one at a time are grouped together and common local bus architecture is suitable for them. Outside group they talk through NOC. Or routers with less number of ports gives better results. Proper grouping and layout will reduce complexity. Here I am proposing a methodology for handcrafting NOC among intellectual property core groups (IPGs), inside and outside of the groups. Final outcome is, reduced number of routers required and optimized physical design of SoC. © 2017 IEEE.",2 Dimensional Mesh (2D Mesh); Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); CAN (Controlled Area Network); DDR (Double Data Rate); Digital Encryption Standard (DES); Intellectual Property (IP); Intellectual Property Group (IPG); Microcontroller; Network-on-chip (NoC); SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface); System on chip (SoC),Buses; Computer architecture; Controllers; Cryptography; Data privacy; Distributed computer systems; Intellectual property; Interfaces (computer); Internet protocols; Mesh generation; Microcontrollers; Network architecture; Network-on-chip; Program processors; Programmable logic controllers; Routers; Semiconductor device manufacture; Servers; 2d meshes; Advanced Encryption Standard; Controlled area networks; Digital encryption; Double data rate; Network on chip (NoC); Serial peripheral interface; System on chips (SoC); Integrated circuit design,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Previously the votes were casted through the traditional methods of polling booths, punch cards, lever voting, optical voting machine, which are now replaced through some electronic mediums. All of these consumes more time to cast their votes. The proposed system are developed to select their candidate through smart phone application. This process consists of three steps: online registration of voter, vote casting of voter and display of results, through the concept of SMS (short messaging service). It provides more efficiency for voters to cast their vote from anywhere, at any time through internet. The important aspect of this is to provide more security till the core, since every vote counts and each of the votes are to be remained confidential. This prevents voters to cast their vote more than once with the use of OTP (one time password) for every sign in and login. It also reduces the paper work and eliminates the manual counting process.

It is more useful to small and medium scale enterprises for their initial startup. It simplifies the work burden in maintaining the server and storage from users' side. Cloud has serious dispute in securing the data from unauthorized access. If users' sensitive data are stored in cloud then it must be secured. Security of data is ensured by encryption algorithms but not all traditional encryption algorithms do so in cloud. To product the data in cloud, this paper proposes an Enhanced Encryption Algorithm (EEA) for securing the data in cloud storage. This is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It uses same key for encrypting and decrypting the data before stored in to cloud. Result of the proposed EEA produces different ciphertext for same plaintext. It confuses the cryptanalyst (hackers) to get the original data. Hence this EEA is efficient hiding techniques for public cloud. © 2017 IEEE.",Algorithms; Cloud storage; Cryptography; Security; Symmetric Encryption,Algorithms; Digital storage; Personal computing; Security of data; Virtual reality; Cloud storages; Encryption algorithms; Public clouds; Security; Sensitive datas; Small and medium scale enterprise; Symmetric encryption; Unauthorized access; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To maintain the confidentiality, many researchers suggested cryptographic techniques to protect data against malevolent attackers in order to preserve data confidentiality. It is observed from various studies, a groundbreaking security system is required to maintain cloud data confidentiality, as the existing techniques are not adequate to protect data stored in Cloud storage. This paper proposes a Cryptographic Cloud Storage Algorithm (CCSA) namely, Enhanced Advanced Encryption Standard (EnAES) to ensure confidentiality of cloud stored data. The proposed CCSA is a symmetric encryption algorithm with data partition and data shuffling mechanisms. Same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Keys for EnAES CCSA are generated from cloud. EnAES CCSA takes less time for encrypting and decrypting date when compared to the existing AES algorithm. EnAES allows users to encrypt data with high security. The dynamic-S-box of Enhanced-substitute stage enhances the security level in the proposed CCSA. The Enhanced-MixColumns stage helps to reduce the execution time. Ciphertext produced by EnAES CCSA is not easily hacked by the illegitimate users. It confuses the cryptanalyst to get the original ciphertext as there are three mechanisms: data partition, data shuffling and encryption incorporated. © 2017 IEEE.",AES Algorithm; Cloud Storage; Confidentiality Techniques; Cryptography; Dynamic S-Box; Security,Data privacy; Digital storage; Dynamics; AES algorithms; Cloud storages; Confidentiality Techniques; Dynamic s-boxes; Security; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Ensuring the security of the asymmetric nature of WSN is challenging, and designing secure and efficient user authentication and key agreement schemes for WSNs is an active research area. For example, in 2016, Farash et al. proposed a user authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs. However, we reveal previously unpublished vulnerabilities in their scheme, which allow an attacker to carry out sensor node spoofing, password guessing, user/sensor node anonymity, and user impersonation attacks.

Some of its many applications lie in the development of web services, its federation with the Internet of Things (IoT) and services for users in the form of storage, computing and networking facilities. However, as more services start utilizing the Cloud as a viable option, security concerns regarding user data and privacy also need to be tackled. In this paper, a security scheme for preventing eavesdropping attacks in Cloud environments is proposed. The encryption scheme is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography and is specifically tailored for securing Cloud services providing storage facilities. As it is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, subsequent results obtained show that it reduces the computational overhead incurred in the encryption of data.

Encryption of images is one of the well known mechanisms to preserve confidentiality of images over a reliable unrestricted public media. This medium is vulnerable to attacks and hence efficient encryption algorithms are necessity for secure data transfer. Various techniques have been proposed in literature till date, each have an edge over the other, to catch-up to the ever growing need of security. This paper is an effort to compare the most popular techniques available on the basis of various performance metrics like differential, statistical and quantitative attacks analysis. To measure the efficacy, all the modern and grown-up techniques are implemented in MATLAB-2015. The results show that the chaotic schemes used in the study provide highly scrambled encrypted images having uniform histogram distribution. In addition, the encrypted images provided very less degree of correlation coefficient values in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions, proving their resistance against statistical attacks. In addition, these schemes are able to resist differential attacks as these showed a high sensitivity for the initial conditions, i.e. pixel and key values. Finally, the schemes provide a large key spacing, hence can resist the brute force attacks, and provided a very less computational time for image encryption/decryption in comparison to other schemes available in literature. © 2017, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Chaotic function; Cryptography; Differential attacks; Encryption/decryption; S-box; Statistical attacks,Data transfer; Image processing; Screen printing; Security of data; Chaotic functions; Differential attacks; Encryption/decryption; S-box; Statistical attacks; Cryptography,"Gupta, S.; YMCA University of Science and TechnologyIndia; email: shailender81@gmail.com",,3D Display Research Center,20926731,,,,English,3D Res.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034656981

Several countermeasures to thwart such analysis have been also proposed in the related cryptographic literature. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel combination of power and fault analysis strategies to devise attacks against such protected implementations of Grain stream cipher. We considered clock glitch induced faults occurring in practice to construct our fault model. In addition, we developed a generic power analysis attack technique against the Grain family of stream ciphers assuming that the cipher implementation can be resynchronized multiple times with a fixed secret key and any randomly generated initialization vector. Subsequently, we combine our proposed power analysis strategy with the notion of the practically occurring faults to mount attacks on various fault attack countermeasures. In order to validate our proposed power analysis attack, we report the results of power trace classifications of a Grain v1 implementation on SASEBO-GII board. The captured power traces were analyzed using least squares support vector machine learning algorithm-based multiclass classifiers to segregate the power traces into the respective Hamming distance (HD) classes. To extract power samples with high information about HD classes, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric was chosen for feature selection.

Digital signature must be unique and exclusive for each signer. Multiple Digital Signatures signed by either single or multiple signers can be verified at once through Batch Verification. There are two main issues with respect to Batch Verification of Digital Signatures; first is the security problem and the second is the computational speed. Due to e-commerce proliferation, quick verification of Digital Signatures through specific hardware or efficient software becomes critical. Internet companies, banks, and other such organizations use Batch verification to accelerate verification of large number of Digital Signatures. Many Batch Verification techniques have been proposed for various Digital Signature algorithms. But most of them lack the security requirements such as signature authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. Hence there is a need for the study of batch verification of Digital Signatures.

Also with the increased data traffic, it is hard to transmit the entire bulky medical data. New methods have come into the scene to reduce the traffic while maintaining the sufficient level of security. Partial encryption is one of the methods which selectively encrypt the bulky medical image. Meanwhile, if the same medical image is needed to be reused for another diagnosis, then it is recommended to protect the entire medical image. This paper proposes a hybrid encryption scheme based on deoxyribo nucleic acid and chaotic maps, which can be adaptable for both selective and full medical image encryption. The proposed algorithm uses multiple chaotic maps in single process to generate the highly random keys for encrypting the color digital imaging and communications in medicine image. The algorithm comprises three phases, namely, permutation, encoding, and diffusion. In all the phases, the selection of specific rule set depends on the key sequences produced from the combined chaotic system. Experimental results are carried out to validate the resistance of the developed algorithm toward statistical, differential, and brute force attacks. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",combined chaotic system; DICOM; DNA encoding; partial and full image encryption,Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Diagnosis; DNA; Encoding (symbols); Image coding; Image processing; Lyapunov methods; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Nucleic acids; Signal encoding; Brute-force attack; DICOM; DNA encoding; Hybrid encryption schemes; Image encryptions; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medical image encryptions; Partial encryption; Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM),"Amirtharajan, R.; ECE, SEEE, SASTRA Deemed UniversityIndia; email: amir@ece.sastra.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15361241,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

The traditional key exchange protocols involve a trusted key generation center for generation and distribution of the group key among the various group members. Therefore, the establishment of a trusted key generation center server and the generation (and distribution) of common session key require an extra overhead. To avoid this difficulty, a number of group key exchange protocols have been proposed in the literature. However, these protocols are vulnerable to many attacks and have a high computational and communication cost. In this paper, we present an elliptic curve cryptography–based authenticated group key exchange (ECC-AGKE) protocol, which provides better security and has lower computational cost compared to related proposed schemes. Further, a complexity reduction method is deployed to reduce the overall complexity of the proposed elliptic curve cryptography–based authenticated group key exchange protocol. The security of proposed work is ensured by the properties of elliptic curves. A security adversarial model is given and an extensive formal security analysis against our claim is done in the random oracle model. We also made a comparison of our proposed protocol with similar works and found that ours have better complexity, security and efficiency over others.

The security solutions proposed by various researchers failed in considering mobility aware node to node communication in the infrastructure-less ad hoc networks. Besides, the certificates as well as key management and verification complexities associated in MANET with a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework are significantly large. This paper addresses the issue of certificate assignment and key management of secure group communications over MANET. We propose a novel certificate assignment strategy in order to significantly reduce the complexity of managing the PKI framework. The strategy involves partitioning the entire network into a number of cluster regions, and the assignment of region-specific certificates to a node resident in a cluster. We further proposed a secure key agreement scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) to eliminate the security flaws and provide better security requirements. The proposed ECC-CRT key agreement scheme resists the know security attacks and provides authenticated group communication with less complexities and computational cost. The performances of proposed schemes are evaluated by simulation analysis and when compared with existing schemes, our schemes have the following advantages. (1) Simple to execute the certificate assignment and key agreement phases. (2) Easy to address dynamic rekeying when a node is added into or evicted from a cluster. (3) Efficient secret key updating scheme. (4) Secure against some potential security attacks. (5) Constant storage requirement for public and secret parameters. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Certificate management; Clusters; CRT; ECC; Key agreement; MANET; PKI; Rekeying; Security,Ad hoc networks; Cathode ray tubes; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Public key cryptography; Wireless ad hoc networks; Certificate management; Clusters; Key agreement; MANET; Re-keying; Security; Network security,"Janani, V.S.; Thiagarajar College of EngineeringIndia; email: jananivs@tce.edu",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028551665

The encryption scheme uses a random amplitude mask in the spatial domain and a random phase mask in the frequency domain. Its inputs are phase-images, which are relatively more secure as compared to the intensity images because of non-linearity. The proposed scheme further derives its strength from the use of 3D-Lorenz transform in the frequency domain. Although the experimental setup for optical realization of the proposed scheme has been provided, the results presented here are based on simulations on MATLAB. It has been validated for grayscale images, and is found to be sensitive to the encryption parameters of the Lorenz system. The attacks analysis shows that the key-space is large enough to resist brute-force attack, and the scheme is also resistant to the noise and occlusion attacks. Statistical analysis and the analysis based on correlation distribution of adjacent pixels have been performed to test the efficacy of the encryption scheme.

Generally, vehicles in VANETs should broadcast safety messages periodically. Since safety messages have been containing traffic interrelated information and sensitive to locality privacy, which is an essential to make sure ambiguity, dependability, and traceability the broadcast. Cooperative transmission is an effective approach for vehicular communications the progress wireless transmission capacity and reliability in fifth-generation (5G) small-cell networks.

In this security system, we have proposed an algorithm for encryption and decryption of RGB images by using chaotic system based scrambling combined with reality preserving two dimensional discrete fractional Fourier transform (RP2DFRFT) and Arnold transform (AT). Earlier developed security system for RGB image data provides only one layer of protection either in time domain or in frequency domain. But presented cryptosystem provides multi-layer security for RGB image in time as well as in frequency domain with no loss of any information of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) components. The algorithms of existing techniques for the security of color images are mostly based on keys, but the proposed cryptosystem provides security of color images on the basis of the keys as well as the arrangement of used algorithms and parameters. Additionally, the use of reality preserving method not just eliminates the complexity of dealing with imaginary data, but it also enhances the efficiency of the technique by reducing the domain space to its half, at least for all the calculations involved in two dimensional DFRFT. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed technique represents that the encryption keys are very sensitive. Results on standard examples and their security and statistical analysis for color images are testimony to the robustness and appropriateness of the presented technique.

Using this strategy the cluster head can monitor the members and also take the responsibility of routing the data packets to their destination. The cluster head has to coordinate with the base station for packet transmission. Generally route maintenance and route discovery is a very important mechanism for maintaining route life. In a route discovery, normally we are using flooding scheme for sending and receiving the route request and route reply message. Based on the route discovery, the routing methods are categorized into Proactive and Reactive methods. Reactive Routing Protocol is also called On Demand Routing Protocol like AODV and DSR. These two protocols help to reduce the overhead involved in routing. We propose a novel protocol STFDR (Secure Three Fish Dynamic Routing), which provides an efficient route discovery technique along with a competent dynamic broadcast algorithm. The overhead in routing can further be reduced by gaining knowledge about the neighbouring nodes. The proposed algorithm will help fix a route for packet forwarding and also utilize the information of the neighbouring nodes effectively. This algorithm is a unique dynamic routing protocol that provides a secure and a reliable network environment.

In SG, charging of electric vehicles becomes one of the emerging applications. However, authentication between a vehicle user and a smart meter is required so that both of them can securely communicate for managing demand response during peak hours. To address the above mentioned issues, in this paper, we propose a new efficient three-factor user authentication scheme for a renewable energy-based smart grid environment (TUAS-RESG), which uses the lightweight cryptographic computations such as one-way hash functions, bitwise XOR operations, and elliptic curve cryptography. The detailed security analysis shows the robustness of TUAS-RESG against various well-known attacks. Moreover, TUAS-RESG provides superior security with additional features, such as dynamic smart meter addition, flexibility for password and biometric update, user and smart meter anonymity, and untraceability as compared to other related existing schemes.

Therefore, for the sake of information security, confirming the legality of an entity’s public key is always critical. Typically, a key authentication scheme needs one or more authorities to authenticate keys. To make a difference, in this study, we have developed a new key authentication scheme using generalized discrete logarithm problem and integer factorization problem for cryptosystems. Although the new scheme works pretty much the same way as regular certificate-based techniques, it differs in that it needs no authority. Taking the password/secret key pair as the certificate of public key for an entity, the new key authentication technique is very simple but profoundly secure. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Authentication scheme; Certificate-based scheme; Generalized discrete logarithm problem (GDLP); Integer factorization problem (IFP); Public-key cryptosystem,Authentication; Factorization; Network security; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Authentication scheme; Certificate-based; Discrete logarithm problems; Integer factorization problem; Public key cryptosystems; Cryptography,"Lee, C.-C.; Department of Library and Information Science, Fu Jen Catholic UniversityTaiwan; email: cclee@mail.fju.edu.tw",,Springer Verlag,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996490312

In this regard, the physical security of cryptographic devices needs an immediate attention. Currently, due to the distributed functionality of the Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing industry, Hardware Trojans (HT) have established a reasonable threat to both marketing as well as military sectors. There have been many reports of Trojans being inserted at the hardware level in both the sectors. By using the conventional testing methods, one cannot discover and distinguish HT; as a result, various specialized detection methods come to the top of this field. In this paper, the effectiveness of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptography technique has been investigated after implementing it over a Basys 3 Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA board with series ""XC7A35T-1CPG236C"".

A commonly known method to attain secrecy of information is done by addition of noise to corrupt the intruder's channel. In this paper, we undertake the principle of multiple inter-symbol obfuscation (MIO) method to improve security in wireless based communication in the last level of the OSI (Open System Interconnect) model, i.e. the physical layer. On encryption using the concept of MIO, an arbitrary subgroup of the respective symbols are put into data packets that are obscured with a group of artificially included noise symbols, commonly known as the symbols key. This tends to corrupt the third party's quality of the channel and make it worse than the genuine receiver. Hence he cannot unravel the information correctly without knowledge of the symbols key used in encryption. A self-updating process for the key is designed for automatic update of the key to enhance the encryption process. With the help of a dynamic key update process the legitimate receiver is able to encrypt the given information from the transmitter and protect it from the intruders who try to extract the message. Hence this method can deliver secrecy against passive eavesdropping and computational discretion against the fake packet injection attacks. This paper has been implemented using tools such as MATLAB and simulations have been carried out to determine the efficacy of MIO in wireless communication. © 2017 IEEE.",Artificial noise; Information-Theoretic secrecy; Physical layer security; Symbols key; Wireless communications security,Information theory; MATLAB; Network layers; Network security; Open systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Artificial noise; Automatic updates; Communications security; Information-theoretic secrecies; Open system interconnects; Packet injection; Physical layer security; Wireless communications; Cryptography,"Ramanathan, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita University, Amrita Vishwa VidyapeethamIndia; email: r_ramanathan@cb.amrita.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Their ease of accessibility makes them vulnerable to attacks and tampering. Certain scenarios require a QR code to be accessed by a group of users only. This is done by making the QR code cryptographically secure with the help of a password (key) for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key algorithms like AES requires the sender and the receiver to have a shared secret key. However, the whole motive of security fails if the shared key is not secure enough. Therefore, in our design we secure the key, which is a grey image using RSA algorithm. In this paper, FPGA implementation of 1024 bit RSA encryption and decryption is presented. For encryption, computation of modular exponentiation for 1024 bit size with accuracy and efficiency is needed and it is carried out by repeated modular multiplication technique. For decryption, L-R binary approach is used which deploys modular multiplication module. Efficiency in our design is achieved in terms of throughput/area ratio as compared to existing implementations. QR codes security is demonstrated by deploying AES-RSA hybrid design in Xilinx System Generator(XSG). XSG helps in hardware co-simulation and reduces the difficulty in structural design. Further, to ensure efficient encryption of the shared key by RSA, histograms of the images of key before and after encryption are generated and analysed for strength of encryption. © 2017 IEEE.",FPGA; Image security; Modular exponentiation; Modular multiplication; RSA; VHDL; XSG,Codes (symbols); Computer hardware description languages; Efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Structural design; Encryption and decryption; Image security; Modular Exponentiation; Modular Multiplication; Modular multiplication techniques; Rsa encryption and decryptions; Symmetric key algorithms; Xilinx system generators (XSG); Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Reversible data hiding techniques are gaining huge importance in recent years due to its excellent feature of enabling zero distortion reconstruction of both cover medium information as well as secret data information, while protecting the confidentiality of the payload image information. We propose an algorithm where in, encrypted cover image is generated by bitwise XOR ing the cover medium information with the key stream. Data hiding in the encrypted domain is achieved through public key modulation scheme. Prior to embedding of secret information , Huffman encoding technique is used to compress the payload information in a lossless fashion. At the receiver end a powerful and most popular support vector machine classifier is used to separate encrypted and non encrypted image blocks using support vectors, which defines the hyper plane. Four of the features selected for categorizing encrypted and non encrypted blocks are • Pixel variation in all four directions • Entropy • Standard deviation • Histogram This enables simultaneous decoding of secret information as well as cover medium information. Later Huffman decoding technique is applied to retrieve the payload information in a lossless fashion. Hence the proposed technique assures hundred percent PSNR, higher embedding capacity and greater level of security.

There are various requirements that need to be addressed by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for enabling the cloud services to the users such as security, performance, availability, integrability, customization with minimal cost. If any of these requirements are not met, then the user wishes to switch from current CSP to a new CSP. To achieve that the user has to download all the digital assets, services, IT resources and applications from one CSP and upload into another CSP. This process has many issues like security, vendor management, technical integration, requirement of time and energy resources, etc; The first one being a major concern which we are addressing it in this paper.

The proposed approach comprises of mutual authentication, blended with key splitting and sharing methods that ensure pre-migration authentication. The migration of data is then performed by encrypting with symmetric keys, which are shared using RSA Cryptosystem.

This paper explores an efficient method of secure data transmission through information hiding which includes text steganography and cryptography. The proposed methodology was built on top of the result of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a symmetric key algorithm used for cryptography. The concept of data hiding is realized using text steganography i.e. a secret message is concealed within another text. The text used to hide the sensitive information was constructed dynamically and did not reveal the presence of any secret data. It can be concluded that the combination of these two cryptographic techniques provides an efficient solution for information hiding and data transmission through unsecured channels. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptography; Data Encryption Standard (DES); Information Hiding; Text Steganography,Data transfer; Mobile commerce; Security of data; Steganography; Confidential information; Cryptographic techniques; Data encryption standard; Information hiding; Secure data transmissions; Social networking sites; Symmetric key algorithms; Text steganography; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This had shown astonishing performance in sentence and document modeling. To leverage this, we use LSTM network to the encrypted text categorization at character and word level of texts. These texts are transformed in to dense word-vectors by using bag-of-words embedding. Dense word vectors are fed in to recurrent layers to capture the contextual information and followed by dense and activation layer with nonlinear activation function such as softmax for classification. The optimal network architecture has found by conducting various experiments with varying network parameters and network structures. All the experiments are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-0.5]. Most of the LSTM network structures substantially performed well in 5-fold cross-validation. Based on the 5-fold cross-validation results, we claim that the character level inputs are more efficient in dealing with the encrypted texts in comparison to word level, due to the fact that character level input keeps more information from lowlevel textual representations. Character level based LSTM models achieved highest accuracy as 0.99 and the word level achieved highest accuracy as 0.94 in the classification settings of 5-fold cross validation using LSTM networks. On the real-world test data of CDMC 2016 e-News categorization task, word level LSTM models attained its highest accuracy as 0.43. © 2017 IEEE.",Encrypted; Long shortterm memory (LSTM); Recurrent neural network (RNN); Text categorization; Word embedding0s,Chemical activation; Classification (of information); Cryptography; Network architecture; Recurrent neural networks; Text processing; Contextual information; Encrypted; Nonlinear activation functions; Optimal network architecture; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Text categorization; Textual representation; Word embedding0s; Long short-term memory,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this system Web Services are requested using URL (Uniform Resource Locator) query to the WWW instead of SOAP message. When invoking the web services using JAX-RPC (Java Api for Xml-Based Remote Procedure Call ) with SOAP request, the result returned may not be received properly due to de-serialization problem of complex XML data sets. Therefore it is required to invoke such services by submitting the query as URL query and received the results as XML data set. This XML data set may be hampered by man-in-middle attack during transfer. Hence this system uses open source APIs for providing XML signature and XML encryption. At the receiver after decryption and integrity check, the required node from XML data set is extracted and presented to the user. This article is focused on usage of open source APIs (Application program interface) for invoking web services as Restful Web services, applying XML signature and XML encryption, parsing the XML result after reverse process at receiver side and extracting the required nodes according to the user given condition.

The quantum computing concept is used to decide the connection weights and threshold of neurons. A boundary threshold parameter is introduced to optimally determine the neuron threshold. This parameter uses min, max function to decide threshold, which assists efficient learning. A manually prepared signature dataset is used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. To uniquely identify the signature, several novel features are selected such as the number of loops present in the signature, the boundary calculation, the number of vertical and horizontal dense patches, and the angle measurement. A total of 45 features are extracted from each signature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by rigorous training and testing with these signatures using partitions of 60–40 and 70–30%, and a tenfold cross-validation. To compare the results derived from the proposed quantum neural network, the same dataset is tested on support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, back propagation neural network, and Naive Bayes.

Outsourcing health, educational, financial, multimedia data to cloud storage server is beneficial as it eliminate the burden of initial infrastructure setup and maintenance costs. However data storage security and integrity remains challenging due to lack of control and physical possession over the data by the DOs. In this paper we present a lightweight auditing method for integrity verification and deduplication of outsourced data. The proposed scheme combines hashing and symmetric encryption with improved distributed hash table data structure which reduces the communication and computation overhead for integrity verification and also enables efficient dynamic operations of the data. The storage cost is drastically decreased by deduplication using the combined techniques of convergent encryption and filters.

Very recently, Amin-Biswas proposes bilinear pairing–based multiserver scheme by describing some security pitfalls of Hsieh-Leu protocol and claims that it is secured against related security threats. However, this paper claims that Amin-Biswas protocol is still susceptible to off-line identity and password guessing attack, user untraceability attack, and server masquerading attack. The cryptographic protocol should be attacks-free for real-time application. To achieve attacks-free security, we put forward smart card–based multiserver authentication protocol by using the concept of bilinear pairing operation. The formal method strand space model has been used to prove the correctness of the proposed scheme. Additionally, rigorous security analysis ensures pliability of common security threats. The performance and security features of our scheme are also compared with that of the similar existing schemes. The comparison results show that our protocol achieves more security features with less complexity.

An adversary node can also actively participate in the network to launch other attacks like replay attack and denial of service attack. Hence, compromised node detection is essential for the security of such networks. In this paper, we have considered two major issues of wireless ad hoc network. First one is the key distribution and the second one is compromised node detection. For key distribution purpose, we have proposed a bilinear pairing based key distribution technique, which is efficient for resource constrained devices.

The need for data security in the cloud is progressively higher as the abundant sensitive data in the cloud are transferred among various stakeholders for data operations leads to loss of data confidentiality. To maintain data confidentiality in the cloud, the data need to be encrypted with cryptographic algorithms. Existing cryptographic algorithms face the challenges of key management, dynamic encryption, and computational complexity. In this paper, a novel variant of DNA cryptosystem is proposed to secure the original data within the DNA nucleotides providing greater storage space, reduced overhead and dynamic operations. The significance of DNA is incorporated in the proposed Novel DNA cryptosystem, which encrypts the data transferred between the Data Owner and the Data User in the cloud. Enhanced ElGamal cryptosystem is the proposed asymmetric cryptosystem used to address key management issues in the cloud, by securely transferring the key file between the Data Owner and the Data User. Enhanced ElGamal cryptosystem provides better user authentication and performance with respect to the security accomplishment against attacks. At the same time, Novel DNA cryptosystem achieves better performance, reduced the complexity of implementing the properties of DNA and embarks upon a standardized algorithmic approach among the existing DNA cryptographic methodologies. The performance analysis, mathematical proof as well as security analysis forms the security metrics and it meets out the proposed objectives.

To provide data privacy and integrity, most of the research works were focused under single data owner for secure searching of encrypted data over the cloud. Provided, various cloud service providers in day today life do not provide service to single data owner. Instead, the cloud service provider support multiple data owners to share the various benefits provided by the cloud computing. Data users are initially authenticated to establish a secure search over the encrypted cloud data. The data users can have a secure search without having knowledge regarding the real data and the secret keys of the data owners. Wei et al [9] proposed a privacy preserving ranked multi-keyword search. In this approach, ranking based multi-keyword searching mechanism was developed. The main advantage of this work is data privacy. So the authors claim that the proposed protocol provides data privacy by preventing the hackers from eavesdropping the secret keys and impersonating like a legitimate data user while submitting the search request to the cloud. Initially, after extensive analysis performed in this research work, we have identified several issues in the protocol proposed by Wei et al scheme. First the proposed protocol is vulnerable to impersonation attack. Therefore, when the attacker submits a request, the cloud server cannot find the difference between the request submitted by the legitimate user and the attacker. We have provided a detailed analysis of this attack in this paper and a formal proof of this attack is also given to prove that this scheme is a vulnerable one. Therefore, it is essential to develop a new efficient secure ranking based multi-keyword searching mechanism which enables the data users to perform a secure data access from the untrusted pubic cloud. © 2017 IEEE.",cloud computing; data privacy; impersonation attack; ranked multi-keyword; secret key,Access control; Authentication; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Distributed database systems; Online searching; Personal computing; Search engines; Cloud service providers; Encrypted data; Formal proofs; Impersonation attack; Legitimate users; Multi keywords; Privacy preserving; Secret key; Data privacy,,Qiu M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Strong correlation between the adjacent pixels can be observed in the multimedia images. The encryption can be made effective by changing both position and value of each pixel in the image. In the proposed algorithm, each pixel position is scrambled using discrete radon transformation (DRT) and pixel value is varied using non chaotic substitution and permutation. The key length used is 64 bits. The secrete key is divided into eight separate keys each of length 8 bits and these are used to change the pixel position along with DRT. Simultaneously, the secret key is subjected for eight set of initial permutations and each set is used to change the pixel value of the image using exclusive-OR operation. © 2017 IEEE.",Correlation; Discrete Radon Transformation; Exclusive-OR; Non chaotic substitution; Symmetric key encryption,Correlation methods; Pixels; Exclusive OR operation; Exclusive-OR; Image encryptions; Multimedia images; Radon transformations; Strong correlation; Symmetric key encryption; Symmetric key encryption algorithm; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The rise in cloud computing is due to the provided facilities such as flexibility, disaster recovery, security, etc. Moving data into cloud servers provide great convenience to users because they just have to upload their data and not care about the hardware management and security. But, the sensitive or privacy relevant data has some major implications. The techniques used so far for storage security are the cryptographic methods and some compression techniques such as compression sensing, JPEG compression technique, etc. to make more space for future data. In this paper we propose a system so that the cloud storage can be made more secure. To increase the efficiency, we are using DCT algorithm for compression and AES for encryption. The main concept of the proposed system is to increase the security so we are splitting the image in chunks. This Image splitting method, lowers the risk of image being retrieved by attacker as we upload the chunks instead of image. © 2017 IEEE.",cloud storage; Image splitting; privacy; security,Access control; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Image compression; Network security; Cloud storages; Compression sensing; Compression techniques; Cryptographic methods; Data access control; Government services; Image splitting; security; Information management,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

Scrambling process plays an important role in achieving better confusion during the image encryption. An image encryption scheme based on cyclic shift and chaotic system has been proposed by Wang X-Y et al, 2015 [1]. In that approach, the scrambling process based on logistic map sequence was not efficient to randomize the pixels during image encryption. The randomization resulted in repetitive pixel addresses before reaching the maximal length sequence i.e. total number of image pixels. The lossless reproduction of the secret image during the decryption can only be improved by choosing proper scrambling source during the encryption. This paper addresses some of the issues of that work and proposes an alternate way to perform scrambling with enhanced multiuser improved authentication mechanism. © 2017 IEEE.",Chaotic system; Image encryption; logistic map,Chaotic systems; Facsimile; Image enhancement; Image processing; Pixels; Random processes; Authentication mechanisms; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Image recovery; Information sharing; Logistic maps; Maximal length sequences; Process-based; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

Data transmission is the prime focus of the Information industry. And how to ensure this safely has become a crucial issue. This brings in the need for protection of data in other words, privacy. As a user, protection against misuse of private information is essential and hence several encryption strategies have evolved. In the proposed scheme, image encryption using various strategies in order to improve the rate of security has been adopted. The methods involved are row and column shuffling, indexing, swapping, wavelet transforms and watermarking. Stego involves hiding a message in a stego medium whereas water marking is used to prove one's copyright protection. The resultant crypto image data is highly secure and it improves the imperceptibility of the encrypted image. © 2017 IEEE.",chaotic maps; Image encryption; stego; watermarking,Chaotic systems; Copyrights; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Image enhancement; Image processing; Indexing (of information); Security of data; Wavelet transforms; Chaotic map; Copyright protections; Encryption strategy; Image encryptions; Information industry; Integrated images; Private information; stego; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Int.

As the application areas of the WSN are increasing at the same rate the security threats are also increasing. Intruders are applying various mechanisms to access the sensible and confidential data from sensors. Hence, strong security measures are much needed to immune WSNs from various attacks. Authentication is a security mechanism that protects WSNs from wide range of security attacks. In this paper, an authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol is based on tokens. Any node when deployed in WSN is embedded with base station's public key and through the corresponding cluster head; it requests and acquires its token for authentication from the base station. The generated token is light in weight and reduces much of computational, communicational and storage overheads. The proposed protocol is verified for its security both formally and automatically. The proposed protocol is proved to be secure by evaluation in BAN logic and found SAFE by AVISPA-a model checker tool for testing authentication protocol. © 2017 IEEE.",Dynamic; Light weight; Node authentication; Token; Wireless Sensor Networks,Authentication; Base stations; Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital storage; Dynamics; Internet protocols; Model checking; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication protocols; Confidential data; Light weight; Mutual authentication; Node authentications; Security mechanism; Strong securities; Token; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The modified Henon map exhibits broad array of chaotic regime when compared to Henon map. The algorithm uses two primitive operations of cryptography such as confusion and diffusion.

It is also known as secret splitting. In this, each of the participants is allocated a share of the secret. The individual share doesn't carry any information. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number or all of shares are combined together. Secret-sharing schemes are important tools in cryptography and they are used as building blocks in many secure protocols, e.g., general protocol for multiparty computation, Byzantine agreement, threshold cryptography, access control, attribute-based encryption, and generalized oblivious transfer. Visual secret sharing, aka Visual Cryptography, provides a very powerful technique by which visual secret can be distributed into two or more shares. When the shares are combined together, the original visual secret can be discovered. In this paper, as first part, many types of secret sharing schemes are examined. Secondly we proposed two variant of a secret sharing scheme using Gray code and XOR operation. The Gray code is used to construct the shares and the XOR operation is used to reconstruct the secret.

In this approach, medical image information is embedded using discrete cosine transform (DCT)-singular value decomposition (SVD)-based embedding process. The medical image is encrypted using CS encryption before embedding into the standard image. This encrypted medical image is inserted into the singular values of DCT coefficients of the standard image to get the stego image. The experimental results show that the encrypted medical image is successfully extracted from the stego image under various image processing attacks at recovering side. The result analysis also shows improved imperceptibility of the stego image with a peak signal-to-noise ratio value above 60 dB for all types of medical images under consideration.

Under the cloud environment, information security is critical to ensure the integrity of data through protection from unauthorized manipulation and the confidentiality through protection against the leakage of sensitive information. This paper proposes a lightweight authenticated encryption scheme with associated data based on a novel discrete chaotic S-box coupled map lattice (SCML), which avoids the dynamic degradation of the digital chaotic system and low efficiency of the chaos-based cryptosystem. Based on the chaotic SCML, an authenticated encryption scheme that protects the confidentiality and integrity in one pass is presented in detail. The security analysis and performance simulations in software and hardware show that the proposed scheme is efficient and provides adequate security through authentication and encryption.

It is becoming a crucial part of everyday life. It is becoming a way of living in which machines perform activities on their own by communicating with each other, without the need for human beings to instruct them. In such a scenario, which concerns daily life, privacy, and secrecy should be of at most priority. Since in Internet of Things(IoT) several machines communicate with each other, mutual authentication and service discovery must be performed in such a way that each of the devices share information with only those devices that are genuine. Hence, private mutual authentication and automatic service discovery is important for the functioning of the IoT without human intervention. But, this comes at the cost of computation time. Thus, there is a balance to be found between the two. This can be achieved by introducing a trust attribute. We propose here that the distance between the client and server and the presence of a signed token with the client act as components of the trust attribute. Here we mention a hybrid approach that determines in real time which protocol to be used (SIGMA-I or policy hiding prefix based encryption) based on the proximity/distance between the entities involved and presence of a token with the client. © 2017 IEEE.",Identity Based Encryption; prefix Based Encryption; Private mutual Authentication; Private Service Discovery; RSSI; SIGMA-I,Authentication; Cryptography; Trusted computing; Identity Based Encryption; Mutual authentication; Prefix based; RSSI; Service discovery; Internet of things,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Conf.

With large scale deployments, maintaining these devices is a seeming burden on the operations. Also, with huge deployments of IoT devices, most concerns center around privacy and security. To reduce the efforts of on-field maintenance and to perform such tasks remotely and securely, Firmware over The Air (FoTA) can be adopted. FoTA is largely adopted in the mobile world, standardized by Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). In an IoT device ecosystem firmware of nodes/gateways can be updated remotely over the air for feature updates, functional updates, device behaviour updates or more importantly compromised/corrupted firmware, however to avoid the problem of malicious updates, FoTA itself needs to be secure. This paper presents a FoTA procedure for an IoT device ecosystem and defines a new secure object.

S-boxes are used for substitution process to enable diffusion in encryption and decryption of the messages. In most of the conventional and modern symmetric ciphers, the S-boxes are of static in nature. It will never depend or vary with respect to the message or the key, but dynamic S-boxes are more resistant to linear and differential attacks when compared with the static S-boxes. In this paper, we propose the design of a new dynamic colour table (DCT) that can be used as S-box in symmetric ciphers and it depends upon a master key K. The same key can be used for encryption and decryption in symmetric ciphers. Dynamic colour table is a 64×4 table, having 256 entries. Each column of DCT has 64 unique values. The input to generate the DCT is 160 bit master key K. We have also developed a sub-key generation algorithm for generating the sub keys and 4 seeds from the master key of 160 bits. These 4 seeds are used to generate the random values in DCT. Dynamic colour table uses the alpha red green blue (ARGB) colour model concept for each entry. Our DCT is so lightweight in nature. Our new DCT have a wide range of applications such as it can be used as S-boxes in symmetric ciphers or it can be used as pseudorandom number generators. Finally, we show an implementation and the simulated results of DCT. The simulated results are used to analyse the strength of our DCT. The different criterions to verify that DCT has the characteristic of good S-box are nonlinearity, strong avalanche criterion, bit Independence criterion, differential approximation probability, and linear approximation probability. The performance is measured in terms of time complexity and security. The results show that our DCT is cryptographically stronger to use in various symmetric encryption algorithms.

The spectrum scarcity issue, mobile traffic due to ever-increasing number of clients utilizing the same spectrum and interference problems will be efficiently handled by CR networks. In this paper, we employ CR spectrum for safe transmission of medical reports consisting of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanned images. An effective image encryption algorithm named Arnold cat-map (ACM) transform is used in order to prevent unauthorized alterations in the MRI scanned image by any un-authenticated personnel. Further, we upgrade the resolution of the MRI scanned image by super-resoluting it by SPARSE super-resolution technique. Furthermore, we analyze the transmission of MRI scanned image by considering turbo code as channel encoder. We incorporate space time block code (STBC) as multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) profile due to its supremacy in spatial diversity and code division multiple access (CDMA) for simultaneous data transmission to numerous users, for transmission of the MRI scanned report. We utilize CR sub-band frequency to realize multi-carrier (MC) communication and to generate orthogonal spread-spectrum.

Recent technological advances in wireless networking, IC fabrication and sensor technology have lead to the emergence of millimetre scale devices that collectively form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and are radically changing the way in which we sense, process and transport signals of interest. They are increasingly become viable solutions to many challenging problems and will successively be deployed in many areas in the future such as in environmental monitoring, business, and military applications. However, deploying new technology, without security in mind has often proved to be unreasonably dangerous. This also applies to WSNs, especially those used in applications that monitor sensitive information (e.g., health care applications). There have been significant contributions to overcome many weaknesses in sensor networks like coverage problems, lack in power and making best use of limited network bandwidth, however; work in sensor network security is still in its infancy stage. Security in WSNs presents several well-known challenges stemming from all kinds of resource constraints of individual sensors. The problem of securing these networks emerges more and more as a hot topic. Symmetric key cryptography is commonly seen as infeasible and public key cryptography has its own key distribution problem. In contrast to this prejudice, this paper presents a new symmetric encryption standard algorithm which is an extension of the previous work of the authors i.e. UES version-II and III. Roy et al recently developed few efficient encryption methods such as UES version-I, Modified UES-I, UES version-II, UES version-III. The algorithm is named as Ultra Encryption Standard version - IV algorithm. It is a Symmetric key Cryptosystem which includes multiple encryption, bit-wise reshuffling method and bit-wise columnar transposition method. In the present work the authors have performed the encryption process at the bit-level to achieve greater strength of encryption. The proposed method i.e. UES-IV can be used to encrypt short message, password or any confidential key. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptography; Energy Efficient; Sensor networks,Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Health care; Military applications; Public key cryptography; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Energy efficient; Environmental Monitoring; Health care application; Security in wireless sensor networks; Sensitive informations; Symmetric key cryptography; Symmetric-key cryptosystem; Technological advances; Network security,"Praveena, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jansons Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: praveenasngp@gmail.com",Prabakar S.Porkumaran K.Jaganathan S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,IEEE Int.

However, when a node misses one or more group-key broadcast messages, rebroadcasting results in additional energy consumption at node end and increased network traffic as well. Self-healing mechanism is, therefore, used to recover the lost broadcasts using a future session broadcast. A node, that has missed multiple consecutive broadcasts and does not want to wait for a future broadcast, can obtain the session key through mutual-healing with the help of a neighbor node. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient mutual-healing protocol that uses Chinese remainder theorem(CRT) based secret sharing for group key broadcast. During mutual-healing, mutual authentication and key confirmation are provided. The probability of an unauthorized member retrieving a past session key through self-healing or responding to a mutual-healing request as a neighbor node is shown negligible. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol provides significant performance improvement in terms of computation, communication and storage overhead as compared to existing mutual-healing protocols. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Authentication; Chinese remainder theorem; Mutual-healing; Wireless sensor networks,Authentication; Computation theory; Cryptography; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Broadcast messages; Chinese remainder theorem; Dynamic sessions; Group key distribution protocols; Key confirmation; Mutual authentication; Mutual-healing; Self healing mechanism; Wireless sensor networks,"Agrawal, S.Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India; email: sarita_agrawal@daiict.ac.in",,Elsevier B.V.,1403664,,COCOD,,English,Comput Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031307985

Though using public key cryptographic schemes like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography would provide sufficient security. Their use has been limited owing to their computationally intensive operations which conflict with the resource limitations in wireless sensor nodes. Key pre-distribution has proved to be the most feasible amongst key management schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

SecuTPGF uses two different algorithms for node and message authentication that incur high computation overhead. To address this issue, this paper proposes a modified version of SecuTPGF called Geographic Secured Routing (GSR). Unlike SecuTPGF, GSR provides security using both node and message authentication with low computation power.

TCP/IP is based on IEEE 802.2 standard for local Area Networks (LAN) that is being used in many commercial and research applications today where it has become an attractive solution for low power and low cost applications. The RF Tag is placed in a vehicle that will be approaching the entrance of an establishment, the RF tag reader is used to communicate with the RF tags and the RF tag writer is used to program or write to the RF tags. Vehicle identification is performed by reading the serial number in the RF tag and driver authentication is done through the RF tag. Both information are read through the wireless 802.2 interface via the RF tag reader and sent to a central database through Ethernet for verification. In order to enhance the data security, 128 bit Advance Encryption Standard (AES) was implemented in the TCP/IP. This paper is based on a prototype development of the proposed system and it presents hardware and firmware aspects of the design.

However, the effect of faults on such predictors and the consequences thereof on the security of crypto-algorithms have not been studied. Motivated by the fact that unknown branch predictors of standard processors bear a strong correlation with 2-bit dynamic predictors, this paper develops a formal analysis of such a bimodal predictor under the effect of faults. Assuming a popular bit-flip fault model, the analysis shows that differences of branch misses under the effect of such faults can be exploited to attack implementations of RSA-like asymmetric key algorithms, based on square and multiplication operations. Furthermore, these attacks can be also threatening against Montgomery ladder of CRT-RSA (RSA implemented using Chinese Remainder Theorem) and even against fault attack countermeasures which stop or randomize the output in case of a fault. The theoretical claims have been substantiated by detailed fault simulations, where the difference of branch misses has been observed using the “perf” tool in Linux. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Branch misses; Branch prediction unit; Fault attacks; HPCs; Montgomery ladder algorithm; RSA-CRT; Square and multiply algorithm,Computer operating systems; Cryptography; Ladders; Branch misses; Branch prediction; Chinese remainder theorem; Fault attack countermeasures; HPCs; Montgomery; Multiplication operations; Timing side channels; Side channel attack,"Bhattacharya, S.; Secured Embedded Architecture Laboratory (SEAL), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: sarani.bhattacharya@cse.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Springer Verlag,21908508,,,,English,J.

In this paper we present a unified notion for counters, called counter function family, and identify some necessary and sufficient conditions on counters which give (possibly) simple proof of security for various counter-based cryptographic schemes. We observe that these conditions are trivially true for the classical counters. We also identify and study two variants of the classical counter which satisfy the security conditions. The first variant has message length dependent counter size, whereas the second variant uses universal coding to generate message length independent counter size. Furthermore, these variants provide better performance for shorter messages.

Rupture of cerebral aneurysms causes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which is having a miserable prognosis. SAH is one of the cerebrovascular diseases with the highest mortality. With the rapid improvement in the field of medical image processing, prior detection of cerebral (intracranial) aneurysms before rupture is on a high rise. In this communication, we have made one novel attempt to detect CA from medical images through efficient amalgamation of automated thresholding and morphological filtering. In regard to this, an iterative double automated thresholding (IDAT) algorithm has been proposed which exhibits superiority over other existing thresholding techniques like Sauvola, Niblack and Otsu’s threshold. Efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been validated over a number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the proposed method has also been compared with other existing methods for CA detection and finally its supremacy has been substantiated. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cerebral aneurysm (CA); Digital subtraction angiography (DSA); Iterative double automated thresholding (IDAT) algorithm; Morphological filtering,Angiography; Automation; Cryptography; Diagnosis; Image processing; Image resolution; Medical imaging; Metals; Automated thresholding; Cerebral Aneurysms; Cerebrovascular disease; Digital subtraction angiography; Morphological filtering; Sensitivity and specificity; Subarachnoid hemorrhages; Thresholding techniques; Iterative methods,"Chandra, A.; Department of Instrumentation & Electronics Engineering, Jadavpur University, Sector III, Block LB, Plot No. 8, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Bypass, India; email: abhijit922@yahoo.co.in",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996844072

We study the notion of hierarchical functional encryption, which augments functional encryption with delegation capabilities, offering significantly more expressive access control. We present a generic transformation that converts any general-purpose public-key functional encryption scheme into a hierarchical one without relying on any additional assumptions. This significantly refines our understanding of the power of functional encryption, showing that the existence of functional encryption is equivalent to that of its hierarchical generalization. Instantiating our transformation with the existing functional encryption schemes yields a variety of hierarchical schemes offering various trade-offs between their delegation capabilities (i.e., the depth and width of their hierarchical structures) and underlying assumptions. When starting with a scheme secure against an unbounded number of collusions, we can support arbitrary hierarchical structures.

Session key establishment between the sensor node and the user is also required for secure communication. In this paper, we perform the security analysis of A.K.Das's user authentication scheme (given in 2015), Choi et al.'s scheme (given in 2016), and Park et al.'s scheme (given in 2016). The security analysis shows that their schemes are vulnerable to various attacks like user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack and attacks based on legitimate users. Based on the cryptanalysis of these existing protocols, we propose a secure and efficient authenticated session key establishment protocol which ensures various security features and overcomes the drawbacks of existing protocols. The formal and informal security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol withstands the various security vulnerabilities involved in WSNs. The automated validation using AVISPA and Scyther tool ensures the absence of security attacks in our scheme. The logical verification using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic confirms the correctness of the proposed protocol. Finally, the comparative analysis based on computational overhead and security features of other existing protocol indicate that the proposed user authentication system is secure and efficient.

Our constructions achieve adaptive security, are based on standard assumptions and achieve significant efficiency gains compared to previous constructions. Our constructions rely on a generic transformation from inner product functional encryption (IPFE) schemes to traceand-revoke systems. Our transformation requires the underlying IPFE scheme to only satisfy a very weak notion of security-the attacker may only request a bounded number of random keys-in contrast to the standard notion of security where she may request an unbounded number of arbitrarily chosen keys. We exploit the much weaker security model to provide a new construction for bounded collusion and random key IPFE from the learning with errors assumption (LWE), which enjoys improved efficiency compared to the scheme of Agrawal et al.

There occur many security issues when records of the data owners are outsourced through the third party cloud providers. The health records which are sensitive must be stored and retrieved through a secure source without any loss in the data. Nevertheless sharing and searching of the data is the key aspect, but when it is outsourced undeniably it is a cumbersome task. It may lead to unveil the sensitive information and so the records may become vulnerable to the hackers. In this report, we have suggested a novel access control structure called as user usage based encryption constructed on the searchable attribute based encryption to guarantee the data protection. Usage is mapped as credential with a time frame to every private attribute. The data user can decipher a fortified attribute only if there is a match between the credentials associated with the attribute. Using the feature extraction algorithm the searchable encryption scheme enables a consistent routing of encrypted attributes. Multi-Credential routing is applied to strengthen the confidentiality of the fragile records. We allow the data user to perpetuate the credentials according to their usage criteria also the user receives the keys as labels along with the credentials. The data owner will be able to associate each enciphered attribute with a set of credentials. Before beginning the encryption scheme we apply the singular value decomposition algorithm to the unutilized or less used attributes to reduce the attribute set. Additionally the data user confidentiality pitfalls are tackled using the semantic clustering of data user. To preserve the data user confidentiality reliable overlay privacy preserving protocol is designed. We manifest a complete security analysis so that our recommended system dominates the up to date approaches in terms of communication and ciphering cost. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Access control structure; Attribute based encryption; Data protection; Feature extraction; Privacy; Searching; Security; Singular value decomposition,Access control; Data privacy; Extraction; Feature extraction; Health; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal computing; Search engines; Security of data; Semantics; Singular value decomposition; Attribute-based encryptions; Control structure; Feature extraction algorithms; Privacy-preserving protocols; Searchable encryptions; Searching; Security; Singular value decomposition algorithms; Cryptography,"Suresh, D.; Department of Computer Science, St. Joseph’s College of Arts and Science for WomenIndia; email: dhinadulcy@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032475203

Using mixed chaotic maps which works based on simple substitution and transposition techniques to encrypt the original image yields better performance with less computation complexity which in turn gives high crypto-secrecy.

Information is not disclosed by any single share except for all shares. Printing the encrypted secret on transparencies and stacking them will reveal the secret. More than one secret is encrypted by the visual sharing of multiple secrets and thus encryption capacity is increased when compared to a single secret. A code book resulting in at least two times of pixel expansion is followed by visual cryptography thus creating a poor contrast level. This proposed visual secret sharing scheme share two color images on rectangular shares with no pixel expansion. The originality of secret is verified by watermark which is embedded into the secret image followed by the sharing process.

Advances made in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the merging of advanced electronic and wireless technologies. Due to the popularity gained by the wireless environment, Security is the main concern. Node authentication without compromising lifespan of the networks is practically a daunting task. This research work introduces a new model, IBE-ECC that administers the energy of sensor nodes with faster authentication process. Signature verification model is deployed to achieve faster authentication process. Nevertheless, the public key-based strategies eliminate the security process but their verification process takes larger time. Therefore, authentication speed is a major constraint of our research endeavor. The proposed scheme is design to achieve high security and fast authentication with energy efficiency. It uses identity-based encryption on elliptic curve cryptography and a user authentication with an energy efficient key management. Further, to improve the speed of the authentication, it reduces the signature size so that it would accelerate signature verification faster. Hence, the proposed scheme will provide a secure key management, energy efficiency, fast authentication and additionally, computation overhead and communication costs are minimized. Finally, the experimental result demonstrates that the proposed strategy obtains 4797 ms higher execution efficiency and 45. 53% lower computation costs than existing schemes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Identity based encryption; Energy efficient key management; Fast authentication; Wireless sensor network,Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Network security; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Public key cryptography; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authentication scheme; Computation overheads; Elliptic curve cryptography; Identity Based Encryption; Key management; Signature verification; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless technologies; Authentication,"Sogani, A.; The IIS University, Mansarovar, India; email: ayushsogani.2006@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032201970

Pseudo random noise (PRN), which is similar to noise and also fulfills a greater number of the standard tests for statistical randomness, can be used as a key for encryption. Using Legendre PN sequence which is based on prime numbers, an image encryption technique has been proposed in this paper. Based on the number of pixels in the image, Legendre sequences are generated for a set of prime numbers and concatenated to generate the required length sequence. This sequence is then used to encrypt the secret image that generates noise like pattern. This encrypted image is later embedded into a larger image using DCT technique to have double security. The proposed algorithm using Legendre sequence when tested on various images has always produced a PSNR value of cover image above 20, proving that changes made to cover image is very less. Identification of key to decrypt the original image is impossible to detect as multiple Legendre sequences are used to form PN sequence. Steganography with DCT adds to improvement in security. The above algorithm can be extended to color images and the robustness of the algorithm can be tested using different attacking methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Encryption; Legendre Sequence; Psuedo-Random Numbers,Image compression; Image processing; Random number generation; Encrypted images; Image encryptions; Legendre sequences; Original images; Pseudo-Random Noise; Random Numbers; Secret images; Standard tests; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Cloud computing is involved in our day to day life as it offers several services, storage spaces, applications etc. As the usage increases, vulnerability and security threats arose need to be studied and rectified. As a part of this, proper authentication need to be done before allowing file uploading to cloud. Compared with traditional identification methods, authentication system using biometric are more reliable and universal. Since biometric cannot be lost or forgotten it provides more reliability and security. So biometric provide more security because it requires physical person to be authenticated. Stealing the biometric values by hacker attack will be protected by biometric cryptosystem. This enable users to upload a file safely from their computer and have it saved on the web server's file system. This would provide the basis for easy ways of storing and retrieving data directly within the database which involves a bit more code than working with data through the file system. Additionally, in order for a user to view or download data they must be presented with a URL to that data. If the data resides on the web server's file system, the URL would be a straightforward process. And if the data is stored in the database, a web page needs to be created and retrieve and return the data from the database. Further, if the data is stored on the file system, the demand and network congestion between the database server and web server will be less than when the data is stored directly within the database. Multi-biometric cryptosystem offer high authentication accuracy, wider population coverage and strong security compared to single biometric cryptosystem. © 2017 IEEE.",Biometrics; Fingerprint feature extraction; Iris feature extraction; Mutli Biometric Cryptosystem,Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptography; Database systems; Extraction; Feature extraction; File organization; Personal computing; Web services; Websites; Authentication systems; Biometric cryptosystem; Decision level fusion; Fingerprint features; Identification method; Iris feature extraction; Network congestions; Strong securities; Digital storage,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

This paper presents a strong hybrid image encryption and decryption algorithm. In order to make the encrypted image harder to decrypt Arnold's cat map is combined with two more algorithms, Criss-cross and Random Shuffling technique to make an altogether relatively stronger permutation cipher. Steganography is used to conceal the encrypted secret file within the cover image to get the stego image.

The advantage of RSA algorithm is to increase security and accessibility. The private keys never required to be transferred or exposed to everybody. In a shared-key cryptographic system, the secret keys must be shared since exactly the same key is used for encryption and decryption. So there may be a chance that an intruder can find the secret key during the data transmission. There are so many limitations present in RSA algorithm. Various types of attack may be happen in RSA algorithm, like forward search attack, common modulus attack etc. Another disadvantage of using RSA cryptography for encryption is factorization problem and computation speed. In this paper we use a modified RSA cryptosystem algorithm called 'Asymmetric key based Cryptographic Algorithm using Four Prime numbers to secure message communication (ACAFP)' to handle four prime numbers and provide security.

The Security of Quantum Key Distribution lies in the Laws of Quantum Mechanics and is recognized to be one of the most secure cryptography ever known. The major advantage of Position-Based Key Distribution is that an authenticated server or device will be able to use its InterSpace Positions while authenticating in an environment while exchanging a secure key for communication over the network. In Position Cryptography the Authentication is done by verifying that a particular Device holds a definite and fixed position in Space-Time. In this paper, we proposed the experimental Time-Based Attack which evolved as modern day Decoy-Fake Shift Attack. The key idea is: an Attacker Eve can change the Shift of the Key randomly to T1 or T2 with the probability of shift, F and G = 1-F respectively. Also, the attacker can Authenticate and Randomize the Probability F in such a way so that it ensures the Receiver's Detection Ratio is constant i.e. 1:1. So, as a result, the two parties communicating via a secure Quantum channel will not be able to detect the Eavesdropping caused by the attacker and therefore the attacker can have an Authentication over the shared key and can, therefore, the parties will not be able to conceal its information. Thus the secure Position Quantum Cryptography can be broken by this proposed Architecture model. In this paper, we represented the Architecture Model experimentally and the Security Analysis for such an attack has been proposed. © 2017 IEEE.",Perfect Eavesdropping; Quantum Computing; Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Key Distribution; Quantum Position Cryptography; Time-Shift Attack,Authentication; Cryptography; Network architecture; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Security systems; Architecture modeling; Key distribution; Perfect Eavesdropping; Proposed architectures; Quantum channel; Quantum Computing; Security analysis; Time shifts; Quantum cryptography,"Gupta, S.; Computer Science Department, University of Engineering and Management, KolkataIndia; email: sayantangupta999@gmail.com",Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78154E+12,,,English,"Ind.

Some authentication is to be performed during the transmission of data via insecure networks. Data encryption is one of the frequently used method for secure data transmission. A great demand has arisen for checking the visual security of the encrypted images of low quality. None of the metrics perform well for low quality encrypted images. A novel visual security index (VSI) is used to measure the visual security of perceptually encrypted images of low quality. Here edge, texture and wavelet based frequency information of both plain and encrypted image is used. Initially the edge information is extracted using canny edge detector. Then, texture information is extracted using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Finally, 2D DWT of both plain and encrypted image is calculated.

Data de-duplication technique has been used widely which allows only to store a single copy of a file and thus avoids duplication of file in the cloud storage servers. It helps to reduce the amount of storage space and save bandwidth of cloud service and thus in high cost savings for the cloud service subscribers. Today data that we need to store are in encrypted format to ensure the security. So data encryption by data owners with their own keys makes the de-duplication impossible for the cloud service subscriber as the data encryption with a key converts data into an unidentifiable format called cipher text thus encrypting, even the same data, with different keys may result in different cipher texts. But de-duplication and encryption need to work in hand to hand to ensure secure, authorized and optimized storage. In this paper, we propose a scheme for file-level de-duplication on encrypted files like text, images and even on video files stored in cloud based on the user's privilege set and file privilege set. This paper proposed a de-duplication system which distributes the files across different servers. The system uses an Erasure Correcting Code technique to re-construct the files even if the parts of the files are lost by attacking any server. Thus the proposed system can ensure both the security and reliability of encrypted files. © 2017 IEEE.",AES encryption; cloud computing; de-duplication; encryption; erasure correcting code; Reed Solomon Code; RSA encryption,Cloud computing; Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Reed-Solomon codes; AES encryption; Data de duplications; De duplications; Erasure correcting codes; Erasure correction; File-sharing system; RSA encryption; Security and reliabilities; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The input file is split into two, in order to make the access of the whole data difficult, and the split data is encrypted using RSA and Diffie-Hellman before storing them into two different cloud accounts.

The proposed scheme is applied for secure medical information transmission or its cloud storage. The scheme is implemented in two steps. In first step, randomization of patient information is done based on a password secret key before embedding it into the cover medical image. Second step is to hide the watermarked image into a secret key image before cloud storage so that even if the stored image is hacked or leaked, the cover medical image along with embedded patient information cannot be retrieved by the hacker. In this paper we have proposed a novel watermarking algorithm for medical images by randomizing the information according to the secret password key and then embedding it into the cover medical image followed by embedding of cover image into another secret key image. The proposed scheme aims to protect sensitive information transfer and cloud storage from unauthorized access. Extraction of the embedded information at the receiver end is done in two steps. Firstly, non-blind detection is carried out in which cover medical image is extracted with help of secret key image. In the second step, binary image watermark is extracted by analyzing the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient values. Performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by varying the quality factor of JPEG compression and sub-band decomposition levels. © 2017 IEEE.",Block DCT; Data hiding; DWT domain watermarking; Medical image processing,Access control; Authentication; Binary images; Cryptography; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Image processing; Image watermarking; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Personal computing; Signal processing; Block DCT; Data hiding; Embedded information; Sensitive informations; Subband decomposition; Unauthorized access; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking schemes; Image compression,,Herencsar N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Mutual authentication of a mobile user and cloud service provider is necessary for accessing of any cloud services. However, resource constraint nature of mobile devices makes this task more challenging. In this paper, we propose a new secure and lightweight mobile user authentication scheme for mobile cloud computing, based on cryptographic hash, bitwise XOR, and fuzzy extractor functions. Through informal security analysis and rigorous formal security analysis using random oracle model, it has been demonstrated that the proposed scheme is secure against possible well-known passive and active attacks and also provides user anonymity. Moreover, we provide formal security verification through ProVerif 1.93 simulation for the proposed scheme. Also, we have done authentication proof of our proposed scheme using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. Since the proposed scheme does not exploit any resource constrained cryptosystem, it has the lowest computation cost in compare to existing related schemes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme does not involve registration center in the authentication process, for which it is having lowest communication cost compared with existing related schemes. © 2017 IEEE.",BAN logic; Distributed mobile cloud computing; ProVerif simulation; Random oracle; Remote mobile user authentication; User anonymity; User biometrics,Authentication; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cryptography; Distributed database systems; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security systems; BAN logic; Computational model; Mobile communications; Mobile handsets; Mobile users; Proverif; Random Oracle; User anonymity; Mobile cloud computing,"Das, A.K.; Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: iitkgp.akdas@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032703923

In olden days, for high security zones like locker rooms for banks, military sites etc, traditional lock systems or passwords were employed. But this solution was not secure. Due to the advancements in technology RFID cards were used, but this was not useful for the user due to the chance of getting lost, forgotten or stolen.

Compression is needed because of the limitations in storage capacity and bandwidth requirements. In normal cases, the compressed data is encrypted and transmitted. But, this sequential approach is time consuming and computationally expensive. In this paper, a study on simultaneous compression and encryption scheme, based on the compression ratio and time, is done for different sized input sets. In simultaneous scheme, compression and encryption can be done at single step which reduces time for the entire operation. Compression is done using Arithmetic coding and encryption is done using XOR encryption. The XOR encryption introduces some randomness because of the presence of pseudorandom number generator. Thus the scheme is more secure against attacks. Also, the integrity of the seed value from the random number generator is also preserved using the DSA algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",Arithmetic coding; Compression; Pseudorandom number; XOR encryption,Bandwidth compression; Compaction; Computer circuits; Digital arithmetic; Digital storage; Number theory; Random number generation; Arithmetic Coding; Bandwidth requirement; Lossless compression; Pseudo random number generators; Pseudo-random numbers; Random number generators; Secure transmission; XOR encryption; Cryptography,"Raju, J.; Department of CSE, TKM College of EngineeringIndia",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

To address this problem, we have come up with a solution of smart surveillance system for certain places like bank vaults, homes where the human presence is not available. At such places, it is not worth to continuously monitor the area with the cameras. This wastes the power consumption as well as the storage required for the footages. Our system will detect human presence using PIR sensor. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detecting sensors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. On detection of any movement the cameras will trigger the surveillance. The proposed system captures information and transmits it via Internet to smartphones and laptops. Live streaming is done throughout the WAN i.e. also available within different LANs. Extensive human monitoring of the incoming video channels is impractical, expensive and ineffective. Using a universal sample-based background subtraction algorithm called ViBe (Visual Background Extractor), we detect motion in red alert zone i.e. a place in the room where the valuables are placed, for any suspicious activity and we send an alarm to the user. The video recorded and stored can be used to identify the intruder and help in catching him. To preserve privacy and securely transmit the video footage over the network, we are using blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm to provide extra security from hackers. © 2017 IEEE.",Background Subtraction Algorithm; Blowfish Algorithm; Decryption; Encryption; IoT; Security; Streaming; Surveillance,Acoustic streaming; Cameras; Cryptography; Digital storage; Image segmentation; Information management; Monitoring; Motion analysis; Motion compensation; Network security; Personal computing; Remote sensing; Space surveillance; Video cameras; Background subtraction algorithms; Decryption; Detecting sensors; Encryption and decryption; Security; Smart surveillance; Smart surveillance systems; Video surveillance; Security systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The main drawback of Hill Cipher is selecting the correct encryption key matrix for encryption. If the encryption key matrix is not properly chosen, the generation of decryption key matrix i.e.The inverse of encryption matrix is not possible. This is because if the encryption key matrix is invertible then only the inverse of encryption matrix is possible. As the selection of key matrix is performed randomly, sometimes it is not obtained correct encryption key matrix using one or two runs. Also there is no deterministic method is available in generating the key matrix. In order to avoid, this paper uses any one of the classical cipher viz., Playfair Cipher, ADFGVX Cipher etc. For that, plaintext and key are accepted as input where the plaintext chosen in this case is not the original plaintext to be encrypted as the ciphertext but it is the text which is only for generating the key and the positional value of the ciphertext is taken as numbers for the encryption key matrix for Hill Cipher. The novelty used in this paper that the key matrix is not generated randomly but its generated using sequential advancement and permutated predetermined procedures. © 2017 IEEE.",Hill cipher; permutated cipher and key matrix; sequential cipher,Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Security of data; As numbers; Ciphertexts; Deterministic methods; Encryption key; Hill cipher; Plaintext; Playfair ciphers; sequential cipher; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

Traditional key management protocols cannot be used in IoT because of its discriminating characteristics. Mutual authentication between a resource constrained sensor node inside a smart environment and a remote end-user is a challenging task in IoT authentication. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for this purpose which eliminates the use of certificate management by making use of the certificate-less public-key cryptography (CL-PKC) technique. Moreover, we do not require the resource constrained sensor nodes to execute public key cryptography.

Thus, care must be taken in handling those types of attacks to provide information security while the user roams through different networks with heterogeneous security infrastructure. For that several cryptographic techniques are employed in mobile devices. Among them the public key cryptographic algorithms like RSA and ECC play a vital role in performing security. The basic building blocks of ECC is scalar point multiplication k[P] where k is a scalar and P is a point on elliptic curve. Similarly, in RSA the encryption and decryption is of the form xe mod n where encryption /decryption key. Normally exponentiation operation takes more time than multiplication which takes more time than addition and subtraction. To reduce the time, exponentiations and multiplications are performed by repeated multiplications and additions respectively. To reduce the time further addition chain is used. In order to generate the addition chain nature inspired based algorithms like PSO and SSO are considered in this paper. Using them, the addition chains for exponent of RSA and K[P] of ECC are generated. The encryption/decryption time and energy required for encryption/decryption are also computed and the performance of the cryptographic algorithms in mobile devices are analyzed with and without the incorporation of addition chain. © 2017 IEEE.",Decryption; ECC; Encryption; Optimization and RSA,Chains; Mobile security; Network security; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Security of data; Basic building block; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic techniques; Decryption; Encryption and decryption; Encryption/decryption; Scalar point multiplication; Security infrastructure; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

Cloud offers huge amount of space to store their user data. This technology has proved itself as a new venture because of its ability for releasing massive computational storage with reducing cost from anywhere to any user at any time. User outsources their data to the cloud for flexible, efficient and seamless services. Once the data is sent to the cloud, the cloud service provider (CSP) alone is responsible for the data. Apart from the benefits, it has lot of security issues on the data stored in the cloud. When a user outsources the data to the cloud, there is possibility to attack the data at rest as well as data in transit. Now the concern is how to secure the data and rely on the services in cloud. In order to protect the data from unauthorized access, data should be in either encrypted format or masked format. Data security is one of the major issues which acts as an obstacle in the adoption of cloud computing. This paper proposes an elegant and novel method to enhance the security of data by associating obfuscation technique along with steganography. The proposed confidentiality technique that combines the obfuscation and steganography techniques. The main principal of obfuscation is that transforms data into new form and it must conceal the original data while the steganography hides the existence of information. The obfuscated text can be hidden in image by using Least Significant Bit(LSB) substitution method.

Even though Cloud consumers or users are more flexible with cloud resources, there exist various issues which bring down the usage of cloud resources. Security issue is the major one among them. Data Security and Privacy, Identity and Access Management, Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Planning etc., are some of the crisis related to data stored on the cloud. Since the cloud users are more concerned with their data, its security is a major issue which has to be dealt seriously. Securing the users' data can be achieved by the conventional method of Cryptography. Encryption is done by using any one of the popular symmetric or asymmetric key algorithms such as AES, DES, RSA, Blowfish and Triple DES etc., RSA algorithm which is a asymmetric key algorithm using two different keys for encryption and decryption processes. The Key size can be varied to make the encryption process strong. Hence it is difficult for the attackers to intrude dthe data. Increasing key size correspondingly increases the time taken for encryption and decryption process. The proposed algorithm reduces the time of encryption and decryption processes by dividing the file into blocks and enhances the strength of the algorithm by increasing the key size. This strength paves the way to store data in cloud by the users without any inconvenience. © 2017 IEEE.",Blocks; Cloud Computing; Data Security; Key size; RSA,Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Security of data; Blocks; Centralized networks; Conventional methods; Data security and privacy; Disaster recovery; Encryption and decryption; Identity and access managements; Key sizes; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

It has become one of the essential services in cloud computing. Many advantages of multi-cloud storage attracts the individuals and organization to move their data from remote to cloud servers. Recently many Multi-cloud storage services have been proposed but most of them focus on the single specific organization and file formats. In addition most providers use attribute based encryption which encrypts only particular database fields which reduces the trust of the many individuals and organizations. The biggest challenge that the present business world faces in multi-cloud storage is that there is no single standard architecture and procedure that can meet the requirements of the individuals and organizations. In order to address this challenge, this paper presents an effective architectural framework with a standard algorithm which would enable to enhance the secure data sharing through dynamic index based cryptographic data slicing. The proposed model is suitable for decision making process for the individuals and organizations in the adoption of multi-cloud storage service based on trust. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptographic data slicing; Data Sharing; Multi-cloud; Security,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Decision making; Societies and institutions; Trusted computing; Architectural frameworks; Attribute-based encryptions; Cryptographic techniques; Data Sharing; Data slicing; Decision making process; Multi-clouds; Security; Digital storage,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - World Congr.

However, each individual entity is not equipped with the right amount of resources to perform necessary computations on large data. Cloud computing provides a platform to compute, store and share data remotely for heterogeneous entities and provides services to them according to their demand. One of the major challenges in cloud computing platform is to ensure security and privacy of the data. The major limitation of applying existing cryptosystem such as AES, 3-DES, etc. is the need of decryption of ciphertext for outsourced computations that may violate data security. Homomorphic encryption is a solution which allows performing computations directly on cipher text without decrypting of the ciphertext. In this paper, we present an efficient model to implement different algorithms related to benchmark computations on ciphertext derived using the Dijk, Gentry, Halevi and Vaikuntanathan's homomorphic encryption scheme (DGHV scheme-2010).

The proposed algorithm enhances user authentication by deterring the password sharing. It is used to train individual, per-keyboard profiles that is based on keystroke frequency of users while typing on computer keypad. The important factor here is the system learning is continuous, more and more use the system the security increasing. These profile use Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm, read at log-on time of actual password key by using the access control techniques to further verify the identity of a user. MK-means values are obtained from the membership functions applied to the keystroke frequency that have been compared against the profile values and a match within a certain precision threshold. If both the parameters are matched, the user grant the access, otherwise, not. The proposed algorithm efficiently searches the number of clusters and their respective location, to optimize the measure.

In this scheme, multiple secrets are reconstructed stage by stage in the dealer's predetermined order, and only one secret shadow is kept by every participant. Later Harn improved the He and Dawson's scheme to reduce the total number of public values. But Chang et al. showed that both He and Dawson's scheme and Harn's scheme are not multi use schemes and secrets are not infact reconstructed stage by stage and proposed a new scheme to deal with these problems. Then Li et al. improved Chang et al.'s scheme to reduce the total number of public values. In all of the above schemes the number of public values will be increased greatly with the number of secrets. In addition, in order to reconstruct k secrets, you have to use k Lagrange interpolation polynomials. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a multi-stage secret sharing scheme based on Chinese Remainder Theorem which needs only n-t+k+2 public values.

Cloud computing is a way or a technique to store, share and access data. It is the most efficient way, it is even cheaper than the conventional way of having physical servers or physical storage devices present at the company premises. It is faster and more efficient. The concept of cloud computing is that there is expandable storage space with no physical storage space which is accessible from anywhere in the world using any device, the data will be available for you. We can access the cloud storage through the internet. The data is stored at the storage units kept around the world managed by data management companies. These companies are responsible for the data the will back it up and it is their job to keep it secure, but even the beat of them have drawbacks. That is what will be addressed here in the paper below, security in cloud computing. Some work has been done on this field it is on that I further build on. Cloud computing is an internet dependent technology, where client data is stored and maintained in the data centers of cloud providers like Google, Amazon, Salesforce.com and Microsoft etc. Limited access to the data could cause various security issues like data leakage, insecure interface, sharing of information. This research paper explains the concept of cloud computing, the various models used in enhancing the security and how can an enhanced security blanket be put around the cloud without increasing the maintenance charges and without making it to complex.

For each newly added user authorization is performed using certificate generation. Authentication is carried out using certificate verification mechanism. Session key is used by all the nodes in the network, for the secure communication. Symmetric key encryption is used for data encryption.

A lot of data created every day so the data management is become a critical task. Most of time much amount of memory wastage because of same copies present on various locations. The process of eliminating the repeated or duplicates copies of data is called as Data deduplication. This data deduplication process is widely used in cloud storage to decrease storage space and upload bandwidth. However there is only one copy of each file stored even if such a file is owned by huge number of users. By using, deduplication system progress of storage utilization and reliability is increases. In addition, the dare of privacy for sensitive data also take place when they are outsourced by users to cloud. In this we use new distributed deduplication systems with upper dependability in which the data chunks are distributed from corner to cornering multiple cloud servers. The safety needs of data privacy and tag stability are also accomplish by introducing a deterministic secret sharing scheme in distributed storage systems, instead of using convergent encryption as in previous deduplication systems. A deduplication technique, on the other hand, can reduce the storage cost at the server side and save the upload bandwidth at the user side. © 2017 IEEE.",Data comparison; Deduplication; Distributed storage system; reliability; secret sharing; Secure sharing; Tag consistency,Bandwidth; Cryptography; Data privacy; Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Reliability; Data comparisons; De duplications; Distributed storage system; Secret sharing; Secure sharing; Tag consistency; Digital storage,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The major concern with MCC is the privacy of data. Mobile users give confidential information through the network, that if not safeguarded may lead to security issues. Identity Management (IDM) is the management of user identities, their authentication, and authorization in the cloud environment. The existing Consolidated Identity Management (CIDM) overcomes the network traffic interception in the traditional IDM but is prone to Identity theft in case of Identity Management Server (IDMS) compromise. This work is focused on the development of a Secure Identity Management (SIDM) that alleviates the attacks in the CIDM by using techniques that strengthens the authentication process and identity privacy. A secure IDM is developed using two-step authentication process which involves Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and token verification. The proposed SIDM model reduces the consequences of Identity server compromise attack. There is a marginal increase in the communication overhead of SIDM compared to that of CIDM but it can be compromised to realize the benefits of identity privacy.

Implementation of these networks face immense challenges due to short wireless range; along with limited power, storage & computational capabilities of SNs. Also, due to the tiny physical attributes of the SNs in WSNs, they are prone to physical attacks. In the context of WSNs, the physical attacks may range from destroying, lifting, replacing and adding new SNs. The work in this paper addresses the threats induced due to physical attacks and, further proposes a methodology to mitigate it. The methodology incorporates the use of newly proposed secured and efficient symmetric and asymmetric key distribution technique based on the additional commodity hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Further, the paper demonstrates the merits of the proposed methodology.

Differential power analysis (DPA) is the most effective form of side channel power analysis, which analyses the power consumption of the cryptographic device statistically and reveals the secret information. This paper investigates the implementation of the S-BOX with the DPA resistant logical style, namely, the Three Phase Dual rail Pre-charge logic (TDPL) which makes the power consumption of the device insensitive to intermediate values. To make the power consumption constant an additional phase is added in addition to the pre-charge and evaluation phases of the three phase dual rail logic. In this paper, the implementation of the S-BOX is carried out in both the static CMOS logic and the TDPL logic to compare their DPA resistance. It is proved that the static CMOS logic is more vulnerable to power analysis than the considered three phase logic.

To protect against unauthorized information access, sensitive data are encrypted before outsourcing. However, traditional cryptosystems need decrypting ciphertext for outsourced computations that may violate data security as well may introduce higher computational complexity. Homomorphic encryption is a solution that allows performing computations directly on ciphertext. On the otherhand, it is evident that the computations on data may vary from users to users depending on the requirements. So, it is not always feasible to allow all computations to different users on the whole ciphertext stored in cloud. In this paper, we proposed a framework for integration of role based access control (RBAC) mechanism with homomorphic cryptosystem for secure and controlled access of data in cloud.

In such environments, data needs to be protected throughout its lifecycle i.e. at-rest, in-transit and while-in-use. Data in third phase remains mostly unprotected as it demands operations to be performed over encrypted data while achieving semantics same as in case of plaintext data. This is a big challenge and thus data remains vulnerable in third phase when hosted in above environments. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to this challenge. We present a scheme on proximity-based-search on encrypted data when a majority of research is limited to exact-keyword-search only. We propose a novel scheme for proximity-based-search on encrypted databases hosted in untrusted service environments. This scheme involves a trusted proxy which facilitates a trapdoor to execute search queries over encrypted data while achieving perfect secrecy as well. It implements an idea of transitive Referential Dissimilarity over byte distances for each corresponding pair of bytes in any two given words. This technique is based on Levenshtein Distance. To the best of our knowledge, such a scheme has been proposed for the first time and it presents a two-point novelty. Firstly, it supports basic OLTP operations securely and seamlessly as evident in presented performance statistics. Secondly, it remains provably secure and practical towards real world application requirements as it does not demand any modifications to existing ecosystems. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud Security; Database security; Searchable Encryption; Word proximity,Search engines; Semantics; Application requirements; Cloud securities; Database security; Levenshtein distance; Performance statistics; Searchable encryptions; Service environment; Word proximity; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

We propose a system where the files will be visible publicly for the other domains and cannot be downloaded and also hide the files which the author of a domain doesn't want to display publicly. Even though the files are visible to other domains they need to get the permission of the author of that particular domain. The author of that domain will generate a key on request based generation and deliver it to the requester. Only with the help of the key sent by the author the file can be downloaded. The file is encrypted and decrypted with the famous CP-ABE algorithm.

A number of theoretical and practical solutions to query processing have been proposed under various scenarios. With the recent popularity of cloud computing, data owners now have the opportunity to outsource not only their data but also data processing functionalities to the cloud. Because of data security and personal privacy concerns, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) should be encrypted before being outsourced to a cloud, and the cloud should perform query processing tasks on the encrypted data only. These tasks are termed as Privacy Preserving Query Processing (PPQP) over encrypted data. These protocols protect the confidentiality of the stored data, user queries, and data access patterns from cloud service providers and other unauthorized users. Several queries were considered in an attempt to create a well-defined scope. These queries included the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query, advanced analytical query, and correlated range query.

The proposed scheme is compared with Shamir’s scheme which is widely used for data outsourcing and it has been found that the latter performs better in share generation phase whereas the former performs better in secret reconstruction phase. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Secret Sharing; Cauchy Matrix,Cryptography; Data privacy; Fault tolerance; Information theory; Matrix algebra; Outsourcing; Security of data; Cauchy matrix; Data availability; Data outsourcing; Privacy preserving; Secret reconstruction; Secret sharing schemes; Secure data; Share generation; Network security,,Dhaka V.S.Elci A.Gaur M.S.Bohra M.K.Shekhawat R.S.,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Proxy invisibility is a desirable property of a proxy re-encryption scheme. This requires the ciphertexts directly intended for a recipient be indistinguishable from those re-encrypted for the same recipient. However, there may arise a situation where direct and re-encrypted ciphertexts need to be processed differently by a recipient. In such cases, it should be verifiable without decryption whether the ciphertext received is a direct or a re-encrypted ciphertext. Towards this, we design a proxy re-encryption scheme which relaxes the proxy invisibility property. With the proposed scheme, it is possible to publicly verify whether a given ciphertext is direct or re-encrypted for a particular user. This public verification does not fail even if anyone with malicious intent modifies the ciphertext. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",E-mail forwarding; Proxy re-encryption; Proxy visible,Electronic mail; Security of data; Ciphertexts; Cryptographic primitives; Proxy re encryptions; Proxy re-encryption schemes; Proxy visible; Public keys; Public verifications; Re-encryption; Cryptography,,Dhaka V.S.Elci A.Gaur M.S.Bohra M.K.Shekhawat R.S.,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Most of the traditional algorithms such as AES and DES are computationally intensive. Hence, in this paper we propose a simple but secure symmetric key encryption algorithm. The image encryption approach makes use of two pseudorandom number generators to encrypt images. Middle Square Algorithm is used to swap the columns of the image followed by the swapping of the rows. This permutation step produces the intermediary cipher image. Subsequently, RC4 algorithm is used to produce a stream of pseudo-random numbers. These numbers are used to substitute the intensity of pixels of the intermediary cipher image, which gives the final encrypted image. Various analysis tests are performed on the quality of the encrypted image. The results of these tests prove that the proposed algorithm is secure and efficient. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptography; Image Decryption; Image Encryption; Middle Square; Pseudo Random Number; RC4,Image processing; Number theory; Quality control; Random number generation; Security of data; Encryption algorithms; Image decryptions; Image encryption algorithm; Image encryptions; Middle Square; Pseudo random number generators; Pseudo-random numbers; Symmetric key encryption algorithm; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The techniques we employ range from area optimization through customized multiplexer design, fusing multiple operations into a single hardware element, folding and unrolling of iterative algorithms, creating reconfigurable implementations to achieve multiple operations with the same set of hardware elements, to techniques of obfuscation to defeat fault injection based attacks on the crypto implementation. All the proposed and existing designs are implemented with 45 nm CMOS library. © 2016 IEEE.",AES; BIST; Cryptography; ECC; Field arithmetic; Fused multiply add; Montgomery multiplication; Physical unclonable functions; PRNG; Scan chain based testing; Stream cipher,Built-in self test; Computer hardware; Hardware; Hardware security; Integrated circuit testing; Iterative methods; Optimization; Side channel attack; VLSI circuits; Field arithmetic; Fused multiply-add; Montgomery multiplication; PRNG; Scan chain; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

As more number of users are adopting cloud data services different types of threats are troubling them. In such scenario available Cloud Service Provider's security services may seem insufficient to keep user's data safe. User level security mechanism helps to improve security and user's trust in adopting the cloud data services. In our system we have implemented online data encryption mechanism. It is used at user level in which data to be uploaded to cloud storage is encrypted at the time of uploading. Online data encryption helps to fasten the process and saves user's time. To provide better data access control we have used a strong data security technique in which user's data identification credential and salt is used. Data identification credential, partial element of cipher key, is outsourced to cloud for further use in data decryption process. Decryption process is performed at the user level with the help of salt and one time password. In this system user is kept free from key storage and management task as well as it incorporates advanced and more secured technology of containers to store data in cloud. This paper incorporates the detailed analysis of results obtained. © 2017 IEEE.",blob storage; cloud data security; online encryption; salt; use of containers,Access control; Containers; Digital storage; Information management; Optical communication; Salts; Cloud data; Cloud service providers; Data access control; Data identification; Decryption process; One time passwords; Security mechanism; Security services; Cryptography,,,IEEE Computer Society,21517681,9781467392778; 9781509048847,,,English,"IFIP Int.

Apart of colour correction images is secured by using hybrid cryptography method. The advantage of MATLAB is, it is widely available, continuously updated and has wider reach. In our approach, mixed pixel areas are detected using super pixel segmentation of colour and depth, and consolidate them to lost pixel regions.

Various methods have been developed for data hiding as of now but each have some limitations and some advantages too. According to the level and kind of application one or more data hiding methods is used. Data hiding can be done in audio, video, text, and image and in other form of information. Some data hiding techniques emphasizes on digital image security, some on robustness of digital image hiding process while other's main focus is on imperceptibility of digital image. Capacity of digital information which has to hide is also the main concern in some of the applications. The objective of some of the papers mentioned below is to achieve two or more than two parameters i.e. Security, robustness, imperceptibility and capacity but some of the parameters are trade-off which mean only one can be achieved on the cost of other. So the data hiding techniques aiming to achieve maximum requirements i.e. security, robustness, capacity, imperceptibility etc. and which can be utilized in larger domain of applications is desired.

It is also used for online gaming, surfing, chatting and also used for storing the personal information like photos, videos, documents and other important files. In this scenario, it is no surprise that the basic demand for utilizing a smart phone is secure authentication. Though a number of authentication schemes have been proposed in the literature through PIN numbers, passwords and patterns, they are susceptible for shoulder surfing or smudging attacks. Thus, combing gestures with such authentication schemes prove to be more successful in the present times and hence a new kind of pattern has been proposed with essential gestures such as finger pressure and inclination of the phone while it is being unlocked. This work is different from the previous works in two dimensions. First, the proposed pattern is secure against both shoulder surfing and smudging attacks. Second, the computational complexity of authentication scheme has been reduced. Through extensive experiments it can be proved that this work outperforms many works in the recent literature and hence it would be an ideal candidate for the secure authentication of smart phones. © 2017 IEEE.",Authentication; Biometric; Fuzzy; Gesture; Security; Smartphone,Authentication; Biometrics; Computation theory; Computational methods; Mobile security; Network security; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Telephone sets; Authentication scheme; Fuzzy; Gesture; Personal information; Secure authentications; Security; Sensitive application; Social networking applications; Cryptography,,Deborah L.J.Vijayakumar P.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The reason for this can be attributed to the exponential growth in the Internet users in the past few years. These song repositories store huge number of songs (mostly in millions) and charge their users for listening and downloading them. With increased number of users requires more enhanced security measures to protect such vulnerable songs repository. Any breach in security of such song repositories would not only cause huge financial loss but also copyright infringement for the owners. Therefore, in this paper we have presented a novel and efficient approach for providing security and privacy to huge and vulnerable songs repository using visual cryptography. Presented approach not only provides confidentiality to the songs but also provides integrity verification with access control to the songs repository. We have also removed various basic security constraints of (2, 2) visual cryptography existed in most of the state of art approaches like meaningless pattern of the shares, explicit codebook requirement, contrast loss, lossy recovery etc which are eliminated in the proposed approach. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC",Audio security; Big data; Meaningful shares; Songs repository; Visual cryptography,Access control; Big data; Copyrights; Losses; Audio security; Copyright infringement; Integrity verifications; Meaningful shares; Security and privacy; Security constraint; Songs repository; Visual cryptography; Cryptography,"Shivani, S.; Thapar UniversityIndia; email: shivendra.shivani@thapar.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032212541

In this paper, we have pointed out that Huang et al.’s scheme is insecure against off-line password guessing attack, insider attack and forgery attack. Beside these, inefficient password update phase can lead to denial of service. To remove these security loopholes, we have proposed an efficient RSA-cryptosystem based remote user authentication scheme using smart card.

Cryptosystems that combine encryption and error correction in a single step can offer a good solution to meet these issues. In this work, a nonlinear cryptosystem based on structured Low-Density Parity-Check code that offers small key size, low hardware complexity and high security against differential type of attack is proposed. The method adopted to introduce nonlinearity in a cryptosystem plays a key role in deciding the hardware complexity and security of the overall system. The work adopts a method for generating nonlinear function using maximum length Cellular Automata, so that enhanced security can be attained without going for a complex hardware structure. Also a light weight stream cipher is adopted for generating random error vectors for encryption and addition of intentional noise in such a way that the security is increased by a large margin at a low hardware cost. Different permutation matrices are generated for different message blocks for achieving good degrees of freedom with reasonable key size.

In the current security context, intelligent systems for multimedia security are very much in demand. Various applications such as biometric, e-commerce, medical imaging, forensics, aerospace, and defense require high-end data security systems. Conventional cryptography, watermarking, and steganography fall in short to provide security for high-resolution 2D/3D image and high-definition video. Persistent demand exists for designing new security algorithms for 3D graphics, animations, and HD videos. Traditional encryption method does not suffice the current need, as its securing ability is limited when it gets decoded. Steganography techniques are reported for securing text, audio, and video content, but observed to be few in number compared to image steganography techniques. Watermarking techniques for securing video content, text, and animations are reported in the literature but seem to be few in numbers as compared to image watermarking techniques. Majority of the literature is observed to apply digital watermarking as security means for video and image data. However, digital watermarking for 3D graphics is a current research topic. On the other hand, video watermarking techniques shall be broadly classified based on domain and human perception. Usually, video watermarking techniques do not alter video contents. But current trend shows that security techniques are designed based on video content. This kind of security methods is claimed to be far superior as they concentrate not only on watermarking but also on synchronization of watermark. In this chapter, we present a comprehensive review of multimedia security techniques emphasizing on their applicability, scope, and shortcomings especially when applied to high-definition multimedia data. Problematic issues of intelligent techniques in signal processing for multimedia security and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper was to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in designing multimedia security technique, regardless of particular application areas. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Cryptography; Multimedia; Robustness; Security systems; Steganography; Watermarking,,"Desai, S.D.; Department of IS and E, BVB CETIndia; email: sd_desai@bvb.edu",,Springer Verlag,1860949X,,,,English,Stud.

The traditional two party architectures are not enough to present scalable solution to multi-server environment as user need to follow multiple registrations. On the other hands, multi-server authentication scheme resolves the repeated registration issue, where one time registration is enough to access the multiple servers of an architecture. To achieve efficient solution, Pippel et al. (Wirel Pers Commun 72(1):729–745, 2013) proposed a smart card based authentication scheme for multi-server environment. However, Li et al. (Int J Commun Syst 28(2):374–382, 2015) proved that Pippel et al.’s (2013) proposed scheme is insecure and proposed an improvement to overcome the drawbacks found in Pipple et al.’s scheme. In this paper, we show that Li et al.’s scheme also vulnerable to the known attacks, namely, password guessing attack, denial of service attack, privileged insider attack and known key secrecy attack. We then propose a secure multi-server authentication scheme to withstand the security pitfalls find in the Li et al.’s scheme while retaining the merits of Li et al.’s scheme. Using the widely accepted BAN logic we show that our scheme provides secure mutual authentication. In addition, we prove that our scheme is secure against all known attacks including password guessing attack, denial of service attack, privileged insider attack and known key secrecy attack. Our scheme requires less communication and computation overhead as compared to the existing related scheme. Our scheme provides high security along with less computation and communication overheads as compared to the other related existing schemes in the literature, and as a result, our scheme is much suitable for practical applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Authentication; Key agreement; Multi-server architecture; Smart card,Aluminum; Computation theory; Computer crime; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Lithium; Network architecture; Smart cards; Transportation; Communication overheads; Key agreement; Multi-server architecture; Multi-server environment; Mutual authentication; Password guessing attack; Password-based authentication; Remote user authentication; Authentication,"Srinivas, J.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology KharagpurIndia; email: jangiralasrinivas@maths.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019751768

Various encryption mechanisms are used to protect the communication between nodes. Link failures and packet dropping due to unfaithful nodes are becoming one of the main opposition for the trusted detection of malicious nodes. A failure can occur either due to channel errors or harmful nodes in network. These attacks may have the intention of modifying the routing protocol so that the data transmission through a specific node controlled by the attacker disturbs the network topology. Thus it deteriorates the performance of network. Mutual association of dropped packets is capitalized for synthesizing the suspicious nodes in MANET. The algorithm proposed is using an efficient cryptosystem with cipher text list validator scheme and a communal auditing scheme for the validation of certificate received from individual nodes. For constructing the framework, the proposed algorithm with five phases has a network setup phase, data routing phase, communal auditing phase, error node detection phase and a data receiver phase. This framework makes the MANET node build a safe routing topology by effectively judging the harmful nodes as well as the unfaithful information accepted from supplementary nodes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cipher text list validator (CLV); Communal auditing; MANET; Packet dropping; Secure routing,Cryptography; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Telecommunication networks; Topology; Ciphertexts; Communal auditing; MANET; Packet dropping; Secure routing; Mobile ad hoc networks,"Rahul, M.S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, T.K.M Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: rahulms23@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990818608

The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame (s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA (s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame (s) to retrieve the buffered frame (s) of the sleeping STA (s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA (s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",Fault detection and diagnosis; intrusion detection system (IDS); null data frame; power save attack; PS-Poll frame; real time discrete event system (DES),Computer crime; Cryptography; Discrete event simulation; Electric batteries; Fault detection; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Semantics; Sleep research; Surveys; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Data frames; Fault detection and diagnosis; Intrusion Detection Systems; power-save; Real-time discrete event systems; Denial-of-service attack,"Biswas, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT GuwahatiIndia; email: santoshbiswas402@yahoo.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23299266,,,,English,IEEE CAA J.

Initially the user communicates a proprietary logo image chosen dynamically and marked visibly on a selected region of the authentic digital document. Receiver identifies two secret codes against this logo and its respective region number after sensing the logo from the document. In the second phase invisible fabrication of multiple ownership digitized signature shares on the document is governed by the generated secret data which dynamically decides the bit fabrication sequences, locations of fabrications and the proper ordering of the fabricated shares. This data is actually produced through the separate encryption of the user secret key with those tracked hidden codes and the underneath code of the acknowledgment message at the client side.

The present design paradigm considers very small state (less than twice the key size) and use of the secret key bits during pseudo-random stream generation. One such effort, Sprout, had been proposed two years back and it was broken almost immediately. After carefully studying these attacks, a modified version named Plantlet has been designed very recently. While the designers of Plantlet do not provide any analysis on fault attacks, we note that Plantlet is even weaker than Sprout in terms of Differential Fault Attack (DFA). Our investigation, following the similar ideas as in the analysis against Sprout, shows that we require only around 4 faults to break Plantlet by DFA in a few hours time. While fault attack is indeed difficult to implement and our result does not provide any weakness of the cipher in normal mode, we believe that these initial results will be useful for further understanding of Plantlet. © 1968-2012 IEEE.",Cryptanalysis; fault attack; plantlet; stream cipher,Cryptography; Cryptanalysis; Design paradigm; Differential fault attack; Normal modes; plantlet; Pseudo random; Secret key; Stream Ciphers; Side channel attack,,,IEEE Computer Society,189340,,ITCOB,,English,IEEE Trans Comput,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029645575

This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Generally route maintenance and route discovery is a very important mechanism for maintaining route life. In route discovery, a flooding scheme is usually used to send and receive the route request and route reply message. Based on the route discovery, the routing methods are categorized into Proactive and Reactive methods. Reactive Routing Protocol is also called On Demand Routing Protocol like AODV (AdHoc on Demand Vector Routing) and DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and they can improve the scalability of CEAACK MANETs by limiting the routing overhead when a new route is requested. However, due to node mobility in CEAACK MANETs, frequent link breakages may lead to frequent path failures and route discoveries, which could increase the overhead of routing protocols and reduce the packet delivery ratio and increases the end-to-end delay. We propose a novel protocol which provides an efficient route discovery technique along with a competent Three Fish algorithm. This is based on understanding the neighbouring clusters and efficiently using this information to reduce the routing overhead in CEAACK MANETs. The proposed protocol is used to determine the forwarding order and exploit the neighbour coverage knowledge more effectively. The novel distributed routing protocol guarantees security, anonymity and high reliability of the established route in a hostile environment, such as an ad hoc wireless network, by encrypting the routing packet header and abstaining from using unreliable intermediate nodes.

Besides strengthening the data authentication, integrity, non-repudiation properties, the computational overhead is also reduced in extracting the required keys without any uncertainty. Moreover, effort has been extended to sustain proper signal quality and restrict unauthorized tampering during wireless communication. The first phase of the algorithm describes collection of a digitized signature from a legitimate source; conversion of the pixels of the digitized signature into white or black form based on a threshold comparison result; formation of two shares by representing a pixel value as a combination of two pairs; conversion of the digital cover signal to two distinct frequency levels and casting of one of the shares in high frequency coefficients of the two distinct levels concurrently. The second phase explains appropriate detection of the fabricated share and a user and the proprietary document are authenticated by superimposing the detected share on the second share. The selection of a suitable threshold value to clean the digitized signature and control the share casting intensity helps in considerable reduction of the undesired white noise. The robustness of DWT in narrowband interferences in wireless communication supports its use in the proposed approach. The pseudorandom fabrication position supports visual secret sharing to safeguard the communicating parties from any suspicion.

An emerging paradigm of communication architecture for IoTs support is Fog computing in which events are processed near to the place they occur for efficient and fast response time. One of the major concerns in the adoption of Fog computing based publish-subscribe protocols for the Internet of things is the lack of security mechanisms because the existing security protocols such as SSL/TSL have a large overhead of computations, storage and communications.

As the network infrastructure of smart city, GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) can offer seamless network connection service for mobile subscribers. Whereas, because of the opening characteristics of wireless channel and various attacks, security becomes a vital issue in GLOMONET. Recently, Karuppiah and Saravanan proposed an enhanced user authentication for roaming service in GLOMONET. Unfortunately, their scheme lacks the features of session key update and perfect forward secrecy, and the session key can be revealed by home agent. Besides, their scheme faces clock synchronization problem and efficiency problem. In order to provide secure authentication service, a novel ECC (elliptic curve cryptosystem)- based user authentication scheme for roaming service in smart city is proposed in this manuscript. The security features of the proposed scheme are formally evaluated by using provable security method under random oracle model and also present informal analysis. In addition, comparative analysis is given among our scheme and relevant protocols.

There can never be an exact match to anyone of them. Because of its universality and uniqueness biometric has been used for key applications which require secrecy or irrevocability. Hence came the term Crypto-biometric where in biometric is ingeniously integrated with cryptography to generate private keys which can be then used for encryption and decrypting message. So why the need of generating private key. Private key usually used for AES are 128 bit key which is long and cumbersome for users to by heart. So with this method the same private key is generated from fingerprint and can be further used for cryptography. This paper deals with survey of the existing methodologies to generate keys from biometrics features such as using fingerprint alone or only with iris or fusing fingerprints and iris or fusing two fingerprints of same person. A fusion process is also taken into consideration through which fusion of two biometric features are done and combined to get the keys. This fusion process is usually done at feature level. This fusion process adds an additional layer of security by having two biometric feature instead of depending only on one biometric feature. © 2016 IEEE.,Crypto-biometric; fingerprints; fusion process; private key,Computer circuits; Cryptography; Surveys; Biometric features; Feature level; fingerprints; Fusion process; Human being; Multi-modal biometrics; Private key; Symmetric keys; Biometrics,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A new technique which assembles the encryption key and biometric sample using a cryptographic means is the fuzzy vault. The fuzzy vault scheme provides supreme security to the templates which are stored in a database or smart card. Compared to an ordinary system which stores the templates as such without any protection, the protection enabled by this fuzzy vault system is tremendous. It is almost impossible for an attacker to guess any information out of the fuzzy vault regarding fingerprint templates. But still some kind of attacks such as correlation attack, Attacks via record multiplicity and Blended substitution attack can be launched on the fuzzy vault, which is stored in a database. Among them Blended substitution attack is the major one, which is still unresolved. Hence in this paper the Blended substitution attack is launched by corrupting the fuzzy vault data with a random data and the attack is determined using the statistical features of the fuzzy vault data and the fuzzy vault is self recovered back after the attack without any user's re-enrollment again, by storing the genuine points of the vault which corresponds to fingerprint features set in a server, which is assumed to be connected with the vault database continuously. © 2016 IEEE.",AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key; BS (Blended substitution); Chaff points; CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check); Fuzzy vault; Genuine points; Minutiae,Biometrics; Computer circuits; Data privacy; Database systems; Digital storage; Smart cards; Advanced Encryption Standard; Chaff points; Cyclic redundancy check; Fuzzy vault; Genuine points; Minutiae; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This architecture, known as fingerprint-cryptosystem has cryptography and fingerprint merged together, that securely stores the private key for cryptosystem. The private key of AES system is 128 bit long and is usually alphanumeric. Thus for a user to remember such a long password is cumbersome, hence a system called Fuzzy Vault exist which securely stores the private key. This architecture makes use of fingerprint features know as minutia points. Minutia points are evaluated on polynomial, whose coefficients are the secret key which is to be stored securely. Thus the evaluated values and the minutia points are stored securely in vault. The security of this system depends on the infeasibility of the polynomial reconstruction problem. This paper proposes a second layer of protection using password generated from user, which further does a logical xor computations. This paper thus suggests that even if biometric feature is compromised, without the user password, an attacker won't have access to vault. Thus to get access to the private key, an attacker must have access both to fingerprint and user password, to securely retrieve the key. © 2016 IEEE.",chaffpoints; Fuzzy Vault; Minutia; polynomial; private key,Access control; Computer circuits; Cryptography; Polynomials; chaffpoints; Fingerprint features; Fingerprint systems; Fuzzy vault; Minutia; Polynomial reconstruction; Private key; User authentication; Authentication,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper, a novel combination of reversible watermarking and image encryption technique based on the discrete cosine transform and scrambling technique is presented. Firstly, the plain image is encrypted by scrambling technique. Then, a lossless digital watermark is embedded in the encrypted image by a discrete cosine transform. Thus an encrypted image with watermark embedded in it is obtained. Finally, the original image can be recovered by the reverse process.

Conducting effective assessments in a large-scale environment for online education is one of the biggest challenge. Quality of examination gets affected by issues emerging from assessment instrument quality and evaluation centered errors. Online Assessment and Evaluation System (OAES) proposed in this paper is developed to assess students abilities using diverse assessment methods using 15 unique item types which can be automatically evaluated. OAES provides unified management of five modules of an examination system which includes item authoring, examination administration, examination, evaluation and data transfer. OAES is designed using a scalable architecture enabling expanding of users and roles in an extremely manageable way.

However, most of these applications/services operate over an insecure channel therefore authentication is required before permitting the remote access of those services. In this paper, we propose a secure anonymous three-factor based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environment using ECC. We show that the proposed scheme is accurate and provides mutual authentication and session key agreement securely on the basis of BAN logic. Its formal security analysis, using Random Oracle Model, shows that an attacker cannot retrieve the backbone parameters such as user identity, password, secret keys, and session key. Using informal security analysis, we prove that our scheme defends against various security pitfalls. Additionally, we compare our scheme with other surviving relevant schemes and the comparative results show that our scheme is efficient in terms of computation cost, communication cost, smart card storage cost and estimated time.

The threshold-selection decode-and-forward relay is considered, which can decode the source message correctly only if a predefined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved. The effects of channel state information (CSI) availability on secrecy outage probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived. Diversity is achieved from the direct and relaying paths both at the destination and at the eavesdropper by combinations of maximal-ratio combining and selection combining schemes. An asymptotic analysis is provided when each hop SNR is the same in the balanced case and when it is different in the unbalanced case. The analysis shows that both hops can be a bottleneck for secure communication; however, they do not affect the secrecy identically. While it is observed that CSI knowledge can improve secrecy, the amount of improvement for SOP is more when the required rate is low and for ESR when the operating SNR is also low. It is also shown that the source to eavesdropper link SNR is more crucial for secure communication. © 2013 IEEE.",Channel state information; cooperative diversity; decode-and-forward relay; ergodic secrecy rate; secrecy outage probability; threshold-selection relay,Asymptotic analysis; Channel capacity; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Cooperative communication; Cryptography; Decoding; Diversity reception; Rayleigh fading; Secure communication; Transmitters; Wireless telecommunication systems; Co-operative diversity; Decode-and-forward relay; Ergodics; Relays; Secrecy outage probabilities; Threshold selection; Wireless communications; Signal to noise ratio,"Duong, T.Q.; School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University BelfastUnited Kingdom; email: trung.q.duong@qub.ac.uk",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030265662

Additionally, modern FPGAs are equipped with high performance hard-IPs which has reduced the performance gap between ASIC and FPGAs significantly. Dynamically Reconfigurable Look-up-Tables (RLUT) is an advanced feature of modern FPGAs whose content can be updated internally, even during run-time without requiring any bit-stream update. These RLUTs can be used to develop stealthy hardware Trojans with zero overhead payload designs. This phenomenon when combined with an efficient triggering methodology, can lead to the insertion of covert back-doors in cryptographic applications. Furthermore, RLUTs can be deployed for developing customizable S-Box and lightweight S-Box masking schemes. This lightweight S-Box masking scheme when combined with other non-efficient side channel countermeasures (like shuffling) can generate lightweight and efficient side channel countermeasure for lightweight cryptographic applications. Additionally, RLUTs can also be applied to solve long standing problem of FPGA based IP protection. FPGA vendors are making serious efforts for IP protection leading to standardization schemes like IEEE P1735. However, efficient techniques to prevent unauthorized overuse of IP still remain an open question. In this work, we have developed an efficient IP licensing scheme by combining RLUTs with physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and a lightweight cryptographic application.

Those advances encompass the ever increasing innovative digital and remote mobile devices being operated on the users’ end. Due to the openness of critical system, the service providers in such networks are facing security challenges to authenticate those mobile devices on the field, and delivering services. In this scenario, the Multi-server authentication (MSA) framework seems to be a promising solution that enables its subscribers to avail services from different servers without getting registered to each server individually. In last few years many MSA protocols depending on RC-Offline authentication during mutual authentication, have been presented. However, to date, there is no efficient MSA scheme to our knowledge that is free of all three weaknesses, simultaneously. That is, 1) free from storage of server-based parameters (public keys or other values) in smart card by registration authority, 2) free from the assumption of publishing of server-based public keys publicly and 3) free from a single secret sharing with all servers so that it could avoid server masquerading (insider) attack. Considering these limitations, we present a multi-server authentication protocol that withstands above drawbacks using lightweight cryptographic operations. The rationale of the proposed work was to present an efficient RC-Offline MSA scheme.

Recently, Chuang and Chen (Expert Syst Appl 41(4):1411–1418, 2014) have discussed an anonymous multi-server a uthenticated key agreement scheme using smart card together with password and biometrics. This scheme achieves various security requirements while supporting multiple servers as claimed by the authors.

Using this condition, a set of Diophantine equations whose solvability is a necessary condition for the existence of GBF is also derived. Examples to demonstrate how these equations can be utilised to establish non-existence and regularity of GBFs is presented. © 2017, DESIDOC.",Diophantine equations; Generalised bent function; Regular bent function,Cryptography; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Walsh transforms; Bent function; Correlation immunity; Cryptographic Boolean functions; Cryptographic properties; Cryptographic systems; Different domains; Diophantine equation; General expression; Boolean functions,,,Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre,0011748X,,DSJOA,,English,Def.

To protect user data and privacy on such platform is an area of concern. Many cryptography strategy has been presented to provide secure sharing of resource on cloud platform. These methods tries to achieve a secure authentication strategy to realize feature such as self-blindable access tickets, group signatures, anonymous access tickets, minimal disclosure of tickets and revocation but each one varies in realization of these features. Each feature requires different cryptography mechanism for realization. Due to this it induces computation complexity which affects the deployment of these models in practical application. Most of these techniques are designed for a particular application environment and adopt public key cryptography which incurs high cost due to computation complexity. To address these issues this work present an secure and efficient privacy preserving of mining data on public cloud platform by adopting party and key based authentication strategy. The proposed SCPPDM (Secure Cloud Privacy Preserving Data Mining) is deployed on Microsoft azure cloud platform. Experiment is conducted to evaluate computation complexity. The outcome shows the proposed model achieves significant performance interm of computation overhead and cost. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Classical wavelet transforms, like discrete wavelet transform (DWT), are shift sensitive and provide information in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions only. Shift invariance and directional information are required for better reconstruction of images. In this work, we propose a semi-blind gray scale image watermarking technique in redundant wavelet domain. The primary focus of this research is to highlight the usefulness of redundant wavelet transforms in image watermarking. We have used nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT). These redundant transforms are shift invariant. Also, NSCT provides rich directional information. Thus, they overcome the shortcomings of DWT and are more useful in image watermarking. We have integrated singular value decomposition (SVD) in the proposed method. We use NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition for single and dual image watermarking. For single watermark embedding, cover images are sub-sampled followed by one level NSCT and RDWT decomposition. SVD has been applied on obtained RDWT coefficients. In the same way, image watermark has been processed and NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition has been applied on it. SVD coefficients of the cover image and watermark image have been combined using scaling factor. Inverse SVD-RDWT-NSCT operation together with reverse sub-sampling provides watermarked image. For extraction of the watermark, we follow the NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition and SVD coefficients have been separated by the same scaling factor that was used in embedding. In the dual watermarking, Arnold transform has been used for encryption of the text watermark and rest of the steps are similar to single watermarking. NSCT, RDWT and SVD improve the performance of the proposed method against geometrical and image processing attacks for single and dual image watermarking. Experiments have been carried over standard images and results have been shown for natural and medical images. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), correlation coefficient (CC), bit error rate (BER) and structural similarity index metric (SSIM) show that the proposed method is suitable for single and dual image watermarking, and outperforms existing methods. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Hybrid image watermarking; Image watermarking; Nonsubsampled contourlet transform; Redundant discrete wavelet transform; Singular value decomposition,Bit error rate; Copyrights; Cryptography; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image coding; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image processing; Inverse problems; Medical imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Classical wavelet transforms; Non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT); Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms; Peak signal to noise ratio; Redundant discrete wavelet transform; Redundant wavelet transform; Semi-blind image watermarking; Structural similarity indices; Image watermarking,"Singh, R.; Department of Computer Science, Banasthali UniversityIndia; email: jkrajivsingh@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015723210

To secure the content and still be capable enough to provide the cloud services, many homomorphic encryption based schemes are being proposed in the literature. In this article, secured image outsourcing and ownership verification service in a cloud environment on the basis of singular value decomposition (SVD) and Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) has been proposed. It disseminates the image information via Shamir secret sharing scheme to create multiple obfuscated shares that reveal no information about the image. To assert the ownership in the encrypted domain at the receiver end, an owner specific information is embedded into some of the shares based on the secret keys. The secret information can be extracted either directly from the cloud servers or obtained after recovery of the cover media. Different attack scenarios have been analyzed considering the possibilities of the attacks that may be attempted by intruders once the information is outsourced to the cloud servers.

PRM has been used to scale up the small sized image (seed image) and hybrid edge detection ensures that no important edge information is missed. The scaled up version of seed image has been divided into 2 × 2 non overlapping blocks. In each block there is one seed pixel whose status decides the number of bits to be embedded in the remaining three pixels of that block. The Electronic Patient Record (EPR)/data have been embedded by using Least Significant and Intermediate Significant Bit Substitution (ISBS). The RC4 encryption has been used to add an additional security layer for embedded EPR/data. The proposed scheme has been tested for various medical and general images and compared with some state of art techniques in the field.

Several potential security risks arise while protecting data and providing access control over the data. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channels, wireless networks are often vulnerable to various possible known attacks. Therefore, designing a secure and efficient authentication scheme in the global mobility network (GLOMONET) environment becomes a challenging task to the researchers. In recent years, several user authentication schemes for roaming services in GLOMONET have been proposed. However, most of them are either vulnerable to various known attacks or they are inefficient. Most recently, Zhao et al. proposed an anonymous authentication scheme for roaming service in GLOMONET (Zhao et al. in Wireless Personal Communications 78:247–269, 2014) and they claimed that their scheme can withstand all possible known attacks. In this paper, Zhao et al.’s scheme is revisited, and it is shown that their scheme fails to provide strong user anonymity when the session-specific temporary information are revealed to an adversary. Further, their scheme does not protect replay attack, offline password guessing attack and privileged-insider attack. In addition, there is no provision for revocation and re-registration mechanism in their scheme and also there exists design flaw in their schemeu. Moreover, another recently proposed Memon et al.’s scheme (Memon et al. in Wireless Personal Communications 84:1487–1508, 2015) fails to protect the privileged-insider attack. Thus, there is a great need to provide security enhancement of their schemes in order to apply in practical applications.

It is being realized that vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) which are responsible for the reliable and secure communication among vehicles is a primary area of research in IoT and hence ensuring security in this area is essential. Thus, this work introduces a novel approach to improve the existing authentication support to VANETs. In this proposed framework, first an anonymous authentication approach for preserving the privacy is proposed which not only performs the vehicle user’s anonymous authentication but preserves the message integrity of the transmitting messages as well. Although many anonymous authentication schemes have been proposed in VANETs until now, the existing schemes suffer from a high computation cost during the signature and certificate verification process which leads to delayed authentication. Consequently, the vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) cannot authenticate more number of vehicles per second in VANETs. Second, an efficient anonymous group key distribution protocol is proposed in this paper for securely distributing the group key to the group of vehicles in the communication range of an RSU. The RSUs can send location based information to the group of vehicles in a secure manner using this group key. Experimental analysis portrays that the results of this new privacy preserving anonymous authentication and key management schemes are promising and efficient with regard to signature verification cost and computational cost in comparison with the existing schemes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Anonymous authentication; Anonymous signature; Computational cost; Group key; Integrity; Key distribution; Privacy,Ad hoc networks; Authentication; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Cryptography; Data privacy; Internet of things; Network security; Smart city; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Anonymous authentication; Anonymous signature; Computational costs; Group key; Integrity; Key distribution; Vehicular ad hoc networks,"Vijayakumar, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University College of Engineering TindivanamIndia; email: vijibond2000@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017115042

Due to this important function, the P2DA scheme for the smart grid has attracted a lot of attention from both academic and industry researchers who have proposed many P2DA schemes for the smart grid in recent years. However, most of these P2DA schemes are not secure against internal attackers or cannot provide data integrity. Besides, their computation costs are not satisfactory because the bilinear pairing operation or the hash-to-point operation is performed at the smart meter's side. To address the deficiencies of previous schemes, we propose a new P2DA scheme against internal attackers using Boneh-Goh-Nissim public key cryptography. The proposed P2DA scheme does not use bilinear pairing or hash-to-point operation making it be more computationally efficient than previous P2DA schemes. We also show that the proposed P2DA scheme is provably secure and can meet various security requirements. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",data aggregation; privacy; security; Smart grid,Cryptography; Data privacy; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic mail; Historic preservation; Public key cryptography; Smart meters; Basic building block; Computationally efficient; Data aggregation; Electricity-consumption; Privacy preserving; security; Security requirements; Smart grid; Smart power grids,"Vinel, A.; Halmstad UniversitySweden; email: alexey.vinel@hh.se",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,19493053,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Most cryptographic techniques, such as symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, often involve the use of cryptographic keys. Key management is one of the vital aspects of security in mobile ad hoc networks. In mobile ad hoc networks, the processing load and complexity of key management are strongly subject to restriction by the node’s available resources like energy and the dynamic nature of network topology. The Key Management technique is proposed which uses symmetric key management. The distribution of keys in an authenticated manner is a difficult task in MANET. In this paper, we have proposed a secure and optimal key management system in MANET. Initially the mobile input nodes are selected with the aid of soft computing technique. The nodes are clustered by using Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The clustered nodes are then optimized in order to select the exact amount of nodes for communication. This optimization can be performed with the aid of Enhanced Bacterial Foraging Optimization (EBFO) technique. We use this for authenticating and key sharing to forward security parameters in a novel and secure way. For authentication, we will use the Elliptic Curve Deffie-Hellman (ECDH). This key exchange scheme shares a symmetric key among parties, which is necessary to have a low cost confidentiality in upcoming communications. This delivers a minimum overhead on the network by using ECDH. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.",Cryptography; Elliptic curve Deffie-Hellman; Enhanced bacterial foraging; Fuzzy C-means clustering; Key management; MANET,,,,Asian Research Publishing Network,19928645,,,,English,J.

It is becoming a warehouse of users personal information. Unluckily, most of these data are stored in an unencrypted format, prone to security threats. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, computationally efficient protocol, called CLOAK, for the mobile device. CLOAK is based on stream cipher and takes the help of an external server for the generation and distribution of cryptographically secure pseudo-random number (CSPRN). In order to enhance the security of our protocol, we use the concept of symmetric key cryptography. We present three versions of the protocol referred as s-CLOAK, r-CLOAK and d-CLOAK, varying on the basis of the key selection procedure. In CLOAK, the core encryption/decryption operation is performed within the mobile devices to secure data at its origin. The security of CSPRN is ensured using deception method. In CLOAK, all messages are exchanged securely between mobile and the server with mutual identity verification. We evaluate CLOAK on Android smart phones and use Amazon Web services for generating CSPRN. Additionally, we present attack analysis and show that the brute force attack is computationally infeasible for the proposed protocol. © 2013 IEEE.",Cloud computing; decryption; encryption; mobile cloud computing; mobile device; security; stream cipher,Cloud computing; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network function virtualization; Network protocols; Smartphones; Web services; Ciphers; Decryption; Mobile communications; Security; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,"Hasan, M.; Department of Computer Science, South Asian UniversityIndia; email: m.hasan@students.sau.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028715527

For implementing the cryptographic algorithms it should be integrated within a single chip. Hence a random number generator which produces unpredictable random numbers as well as occupying less area is the essential one. In this work, random numbers are generated based on sampling two oscillator frequencies. Jitters and phase noise's usually considered as disturbance signals. Here the time when they appear in the oscillators is the main thing to generate random numbers. However, when these algorithms are implemented in smart cards they have to produce the same result throughout its life. But actually there are some issues to reproduce the same number due to aging. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to mitigate the effects of aging in TRNGs. Here, a tetrahedral oscillator-based true random number generator (TRNG) is presented and the issues about aging which affect the random key generated by the TRNG are addressed. So we proposed an aging resistant tetrahedral oscillator concept to mitigate the impact of aging in the key generator. The performance of the proposed random number generator is measured by statistical tests. This TRNG is used as a private key generator for cryptographic algorithm and its operation is programmed and the simulations have been done by ModelSim-Altera6.4a (Quartus-II 9.0) starter Edition'. To prove the proposed tetrahedral aging-resistant oscillator operation it is designed in TANNER EDA tool v14.1 (S-Edit Schematic Editor). By varying the supply voltage and transistor channel width and length, it is visible that the effects of run-time stress is mitigated which affect the lifetime of the oscillator in TRNG. © 2017 IEEE.",anti-aging ring oscillator; cryptography; Jitter; tetrahedral oscillator; true random number generator (TRNG),Cryptography; Jitter; Number theory; Phase noise; Smart cards; Cryptographic algorithms; Database storage; Disturbance signals; Private key generators; Random number generators; Ring oscillator; Transistor channels; True randoms; Random number generation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Here computation of 'public key' (P) as well as 'private key' (Q) depends on the value of M, where M is the product of four prime numbers. So complexity involved in factorizing the variable M increases. Another interesting feature about this algorithm is that the computation of P and Q involves the computation of some more intermediate factors which makes the computation more complex. In other existing works, the variable x or M is transferred during encryption and decryption process. However, this approach eliminates the transfer of variable x and M, where x represents the multiplication of two prime numbers a and b. Thus the proposed approach provides more secure path for encryption and decryption process.

Communication is done using wired media as well as wireless media. While communicating through wireless media data security plays a major role. Data security is mainly concerned with ensuring security during communication, transmission as well as in data storage. To protect data from intentional internal security breaches and unauthorized access from external user's cryptography is most widely used. Cryptography conceals the content of original message from all others except recipient and sender. At the recipient side, with no intervention of sender data will be decrypted into its original form with the help of key. Only by using the key the data will be transformed from unintelligible form to intelligible form. By using different algorithms keys are generated. If the algorithm is too complex and consumes more time to extrapolate the key then the algorithm used for providing data security is said to be stronger. Algorithm used for extrapolation of key should be difficult for hackers to reveal the key. In the proposed algorithm middle bit of the original data is taken as key. These bits are not transformed to any other form during the encryption.

Privacy protection of additional data as well as cover media makes it attractive for applications in medical imaging, cloud storage, forensics etc. In this paper, a new method for reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI), is proposed. Our method adopts the approach of reserving sufficient space for the additional data before encrypting the cover image. First we identify suitable blocks for hiding data from various parts of the image. Before encrypting the image, one or more LSB-planes of these blocks are backed-up into remaining parts of the image using a high-performing traditional RDH method that works on unencrypted images. After encrypting the image, those LSB-planes are used to hide additional data. Recovery of original cover image and error-free extraction of additional data is guaranteed always. Moreover, the proposed method is simple and intuitive. Experimentally results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for reversible data hiding in encrypted images. © 2017 IEEE.",encryption; histogram; interpolation; reservation; Reversible data hiding,Cryptography; Digital storage; Interpolation; Medical imaging; Steganography; Additional datum; Encrypted images; histogram; Privacy protection; Research communities; reservation; Reversible data hiding; State-of-the-art methods; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

To overcome this shortcoming, Biometrics can be used instead of passwords or pins. Although, Biometric Authentication adds up to the online security aspect but it can be vulnerable to various attacks over the open networks. Hence, Biometric Cryptosystems are proposed to improve the security of biometric authentication systems and to create revocable representations of individuals.

Chaotic signals are pseudo random signals with no periodicity over infinite length. However, the series can be generated with the precise knowledge of the few parameters like system parameters and initial conditions of the chaotic system. With the given nature of pseudo-randomness and extreme sensitivity to parameters, chaotic sequences are ideal for encryption. In literature, these chaotic sequences are generally generated using continuous time chaotic systems. Since image data to be transmitted is in digital form and encryption algorithms are also executed on digital devices, so it is proposed to use discrete time chaotic communication scheme. Further, its effectiveness for encryption of digital images is also analyzed. To further enhance the security encrypted data is embedded in the dynamics of discrete time chaotic transmitter system. To recover the message at the receiver, design of discrete time UIO along with a procedure to recover unknown message signal using estimated states is given. Existence conditions for the UIO are analytically derived in terms of LMIs. Solution of these LMIs gives the observer design matrices. Robustness of UIO based chaotic communication scheme against attacks is analyzed by studying return maps of the transmitted signal. It is reported that security of chaotic communication scheme can be compromised by studying the return maps of the transmitted signal. To validate the proposed approach results of simulation and security analysis are presented. © 2017 IEEE.",,Chaotic systems; Continuous time systems; Digital devices; Image processing; Signal receivers; Chaotic communications; Chaotic transmitters; Encryption algorithms; Existence conditions; Pseudorandom signals; Secure communication scheme; Sensitivity to parameters; Unknown input observer; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A large portion of such data is of multimedia type consisting of huge amount of digital images being sent and received through the network. In this paper, an integrated image compression and encryption technique using run length encoding scheme and henon chaotic map is presented. Run length encoding scheme is common scheme and a natural choice for image compression. Run length encoding generates (value, count) pairs such that the value is repeated 'count' number of times. In this paper, we used the run length encoding technique for lossy image compression. We designed a lossy run length encoder that exploits the pixel redundancy and visual imperceptibility of human eye to fine details in the digital images. Along with compression we perform image encryption using henon chaotic map. After encryption the size and resolution of the image is changed that further enhances the security. Various experiments are performed calculating various performance matrices-histogram, information entropy, PSNR, Compression ratio, and MSE. The algorithm is secure enough to thwart various statistical attacks while being easy to implement and fast. © 2017 IEEE.",Henon chaotic map; Image compression; Image encryption; Image processing; Run length encoding,Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Encoding (symbols); Image enhancement; Image processing; Signal encoding; Chaotic map; Encryption technique; Image encryptions; Lossy image compression; Network technologies; Performance matrices; Run-length encoding; Statistical attacks; Image compression,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Since Internet is publicly available securing data on Web is much important, some techniques are needed to hide this data. There are different techniques available to hide the data, for example Steganography, cryptography and so forth. The benefit of steganography over cryptography is that no one except the sender and receiver can see the message. This paper concentrates on different steganography techniques to hide the data on Web. One more advantage of using steganography to hide data on Web is that it doesn't look suspicious.

The majority of the research reported in the literature is focused on host-based systems rather than the network-based; unable to detect malicious activities occurring on mobile device through the Internet. This paper presents a detection app model for classification of apps. We investigate the accuracy of various machine learning models, in the context of known and unknown apps, benign and normal apps, with or without encrypted message-based app, and operating system version independence of classification.

We show that, it is possible to detect malicious app using network traces with the traditional ML techniques, and results revealed the accuracy (95–99.9 %) in detection of apps in different scenarios.

However, secure data communication over the network is a challenging issue because vulnerabilities in the existing security primitives lead to several attacks. The mitigation of these attacks separately adds significant computing burden on the legitimate node. In this paper, we propose a secure IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver design that mitigates multiple attacks simultaneously by using a physical layer encryption approach that reduces the computations at the upper layers. In addition to providing confidentiality and integrity services, the proposed transceiver provides sufficient complexity to various attacks, such as cryptanalysis and traffic analysis attacks. It also significantly improves the lifetime of the node in the presence of a ghost attacker by preventing the legitimate node from processing the bogus messages and hence combats against energy depletion attacks. The simulation results show that a high symbol error rate at the adversary can be achieved using the proposed transceiver without affecting the throughput at the legitimate node.

Security issues are rampant. In the corporate or institutional setting, security risks are apparent from the outset. Market leaders are unable to use the cryptographic techniques due to their complexities. Hence many bits of private information, including ID, are readily available for third parties to see and to utilize. There is a need to decrease the complexity and increase the robustness of the cryptographic approaches. In view of this, a new cryptographic technique as good encryption pact with adjacency, random prime number and quantum code properties has been proposed. Here, encryption can be done by using quantum photons with gray code. This approach uses the concepts of physics and mathematics with no external key exchange to improve the security of the data. It also reduces the key attacks by generation of a key at the party side instead of sharing. This method makes the security more robust than with the existing approach. Important properties of gray code and quantum are adjacency property and different photons to a single bit (0 or 1). These can reduce the avalanche effect. Cryptanalysis of the proposed method shows that it is resistant to various attacks and stronger than the existing approaches. © 2016, The Institution of Engineers (India).",Adjacency property; Cryptanalysis; Encryption; Good encryption pact; Photons,Codes (symbols); Photons; Quantum computers; Security of data; Adjacency property; Avalanche effects; Cryptanalysis; Cryptographic techniques; Good encryption pact; Information framework; Institutional setting; Private information; Cryptography,"Rupa, C.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College (A)India; email: rupamtech@gmail.com",,Springer India,22502106,,,,English,J.

An encryption for image is said to be effective if it has large key space, aperiodic nature and sensitive to the initial conditions. In addition, it is also desired that the mechanism must have a good combination of computational speed, security and time complexity. These features can be induced in the encryption schemes by incorporation of chaos during encryption/decryption process. In this paper, a novel image encryption scheme based on chaotic maps and Vigenère Scheme is proposed. This scheme has one round consisting of two steps: diffusion and confusion. The former step involves three stages: forward diffusion, matching process using Vigenère scheme and backward diffusion. In later part, position permutation using chaotic map is used to swap pixel positions. The proposed as well as other mechanisms in literature are implemented in Matlab-2015 and their efficacy are compared using several performance metrics.

Recently, Kalra and Sood proposed an efficient smart card based authentication protocol to exchange confidential information securely between the user and sensor node. We review the security of Kalra and Sood scheme and observe that their scheme is vulnerable to stolen smart card attack, stolen verifier attack and impersonation attack. The entire analysis indicates that there is a need of secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To ensure secure communication in WSNs, we improve the security of the authentication mechanism for WSNs. The main intention of this paper is to confiscate the mentioned security attacks by proposing an efficient authentication protocol using smart card. To validate security attributes, we have used well-popular AVISPA simulation tool whose results shows that the proposed protocol is SAFE under OFMC and CL-AtSe models. Further, the performance analysis shows its efficiency. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Authentication; Security; Wireless sensor networks,Authentication; Cryptography; Sensor nodes; Smart cards; Transportation; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication mechanisms; Authentication protocols; Authentication techniques; Confidential information; Efficient authentication; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Security; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security,"Mishra, D.; Department of Mathematics, LNM Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: dheerendra.mishra@lnmiit.ac.in",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011582867

During the last decade, numerous remote user authentication schemes based on dynamic ID have been proposed for the multi-server environment using smart cards. Recently, Shunmuganathan et al. pointed out that Li et al.’s scheme is defenseless in resisting the password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack and forgery attack. Furthermore, they showed the poor repairability and no two-factor security in Li et al.’s scheme. To surmount these security disadvantages, Shunmuganathan et al. proposed a remote user authentication scheme using smart card for multi-server environment and claimed that their scheme is secure and efficient. In this paper, we show that Shunmuganathan et al.’s scheme is also defenseless in resisting the password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack, user impersonation attack, forgery attack, forward secrecy and session key secrecy. Moreover, the two-factor security is also not preserved in their scheme. In our proposed scheme, a user is free to choose his/her login credentials such as user id and password. And also a user can regenerate the password any time. Simultaneously the proposed scheme preserves the merits of Shunmuganathan et al.’s scheme and also provides better functionality and security features, such as mutual authentication, session key agreement and perfect forward secrecy. The security analysis using the widely accepted Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic shows that the proposed scheme provides the mutual authentication proof between a user and a server. Through the rigorous formal and informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against possible known attacks. In addition, we carry out the simulation of the proposed scheme using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool and the simulation results clearly indicate that our scheme is secure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Anonymity; Authentication; AVISPA; BAN logic; Multi-server environment; Security; Session key; Smart card,Aluminum; Computer circuits; Cryptography; Network security; Security systems; Smart cards; Transportation; Anonymity; AVISPA; BAN logic; Multi-server environment; Security; Session key; Authentication,"Jangirala, S.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: jangiralasrinivas@maths.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010773007

Following this development, the multi-server authentication (MSA), lets subscribers the provision of services from various service providers out of a single registration performed initially. The user seeks to register from registration centre first, and could avail a range of services onwards. The research efforts on MSA based framework, for making it lightweight and security resilient, has been going on a reasonable pace. However, yet we have not come up with a framework that can be relied upon for deployment in an access network bearing nodes that demand low computational cost. Recently, in this regard, Tsai and Lo presented a chaotic map-based multi-server authentication protocol. However, the Tsai and Lo scheme is found vulnerable to key-compromise impersonation attack, Bergamo et al. and password guessing attack by Lu et al. In return, Lu et al. presented a model countering the flaws of Tsai and Lo scheme. We review both schemes and found that Tsai et al. is still vulnerable to more threats, and at the same time, we demonstrate that Lu et al. is also vulnerable to RC-spoofing attack, replay attack, anonymity failure and bears some technical flaws. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient scheme improved upon Tsai et al. protocol.

With this increasing global network, electronic communication between devices is becoming wireless and ubiquitous. Also, most of the IoT services will be realized as real time embedded systems which rely heavily on security mechanisms. This makes security imperative to embedded devices in IoT. This paper presents security challenges faced by system designers while designing secure embedded systems. The most difficult task for embedded system security is implementation of Public Key Cryptography (PKC). PKC based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) which uses smaller key sizes is efficient for both private and public operations. Moreover, with IoT several embedded devices are becoming interconnected which makes ECC advantageous when you need to embed security.

It also ensures the integrity of stored cloud data, and processing of stored data in the various data centers. However, to provide better protection and management of sensitive information (data) are big challenge to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data in the cloud computation. Thus, there is an urgent need for storing and processing the data in the cloud environment without any information leakage. The sensitive data require the storing and processing mechanism and techniques to assurance the privacy preservation of individual user, to maintain the data integrity, and preserve confidentiality. Face recognition has recently achieved advancements in the unobtrusive recognition of individuals to maintain the privacy-preservation in the cloud computing. This paper emphasizes on cloud security and privacy issues and provides the solution using biometric face recognition. We propose a biometrics face recognition approach for security and privacy preservation of cloud users during their access to cloud resources.

Encryption of the data uses public key while decryption uses both public and private keys. So in this method all parties need a key pair for conversing with any other interactive parties. RSA is a generally known asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Modified RSA is the improved version of RSA, enhancing better security. To advance the security of RSA, this paper is proposing a new cryptography algorithm called Binary RSA Encryption Algorithm (BREA). In BREA, the security is further improved by converting the cipher text which is encrypted by MREA into binary code format. The first section of this paper is the introduction and second section contains the literature survey of various modifications of RSA.

We need to search and retrieve all the files which are semantically linked to the query in addition to the precise identical file in a secured manner. But for protecting sensitive information like military information, personal health documents etc, these documents have to be shielded before moving to cloud; which prevents conventional search methodologies using plain text keyword search. It is essential to use multi k-words in searching and retrieve the documents based on their significance order of k-word by considering the ever rising number of data possessor and documents in cloud. Meanwhile existing approaches only support fuzzy keyword based search but not semantic based search. There are works based on multi keyword ranked search using synonymous queries but not based on semantics. For securing the data in the cloud, we use (Advanced Encryption Standard) AES algorithm to encrypt the data and (Reverse Advanced Encryption Standard) RAES to decrypt the same. We use secured (k-Nearest Neighbour) KNN algorithm to achieve secured search. In order to provide semantic based search we include a tool called wordnet where we perform semantic based analysis of the files and then include secured KNN over the documents and rank them according to their order of relevance primarily using the term and inverse document frequency. © 2016 IEEE.",Cloud Computing; Multiple Keyword Search; Privacy-preserving; Relevance Ranking; Searchable Encryption; Semantic Query,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Nearest neighbor search; Search engines; Semantics; Keyword search; Privacy preserving; Relevance ranking; Searchable encryptions; Semantic query; Semantic Web,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

And power analysis based side channel attacks and designing countermeasures against side channel attacks is a well established research area. Trust-Hub provides a power based side-channel attack promoting Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) HT benchmarks for research.

FinFETs are also being scaled to 14 nm. To further push the limits of scaling and decrease leakage currents, Dopingless FET (DL-FET) transistors were introduced. DL-FETs show a promising decrease in leakage with low power consumption. An application using these devices, a hybrid oscillator arbiter physical unclonable function (PUF) using DL-FETs is presented here. Two different designs, one speed optimized and one power optimized are presented for different designs such as low power and also high performance.

This algorithm uses double encryption and decryption using double private and public keys to provide security against Brute-force attacks. Therefore, if an intruder detects a single key of cryptosystem even then it is not possible to decrypt the message. The basic motivation behind this paper is that in conventional RSA algorithm if we can factor modulus (n) into its prime numbers then we can generate private key.

The proposed technique is made further robust by the incorporation of the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) encryption technique. Our scheme is compared with the recently proposed CRT-based DCT technique, CRT-based spatial domain watermarking, and DCT-based inter block correlation techniques. Extensive simulation experiments show better robustness in common image manipulations and, at the same time, the proposed technique successfully makes the watermark perceptually invisible. A better Tamper Assessment Function (TAF) value of 2–15% and a better Normalized Correlation (NC) is achieved compared to some of the above techniques.

The cipher LiCi has Feistel based network which operates on 64 bits plain text and with the help of 128 bits key length it generates 64 bits cipher text. This cipher design shows good performance both on hardware as well as on software platforms. As compared to the existing cipher it requires less footprint area that consumes only 1153 GE's (Gate Equivalents) and has less memory requirements. It also consumes only 30mW which is less power as compared to the other existing ciphers. LiCi cipher needs only 1944 bytes of Flash memory which is very less memory size till date. In this paper, we proposed the security analysis as well as performance parameter of the LiCi. The LiCi cipher resists the linear and differential attack. It also shows the good resistance against the advanced attack like Biclique and Zero correlation. This cipher is well suited for application where small footprint area and low power dissipation are important design metrics. © 2017 IEEE.",Encryption; Feistel; IoT; Lightweight Cryptography; Security; WSN,Flash memory; Security of data; Differential attacks; Feistel; Light-weight cryptography; Low-power dissipation; Memory requirements; Performance parameters; Security; Ultra lightweights; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Enormous storage of data and high-speed computing to customers over the internet can be accomplished using cloud. Security of data in cloud is one of the chief concerns which acts as an obstacle in the realization of cloud computing. Along with quick expansion and application of cloud computing, users concern more and more regarding security and privacy issues involved in these techniques. An efficient method to perform privacy preserving image filtering operations in encrypted domain over cloud is proposed in this paper. The proposed method provides facility for distributed secure processing and storage of the secret image using Shamir's secret sharing method and Chinese remainder theorem. The plain secret image is divided into number of shares in a manner that each share by itself does not reveal any meaningful information about the original image, while collectively, they retain all the information. Two secret keys are used to avail security of image shares and without knowledge of such keys, one cannot restore the secret image back. Hence, the proposed scheme is highly secured and the image can be processed without revealing any information at the cloud data center. Experimental results demonstrate that number of image filtering procedures for enhancement can be carried out efficiently in encrypted domain using the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud computing; encrypted domain processing; image enhancement; secret sharing,Cloud computing; Computation theory; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Image enhancement; Network function virtualization; Security of data; Chinese remainder theorem; Cloud data centers; Domain processing; High speed computing; Original images; Privacy preserving; Secret sharing; Security and privacy issues; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"ISEA Asia Secur.

All the transactions of this currency are recorded and stored in a publically available database called blockchain. Since, these transactions are available to everyone, bitcoins must be stored in a secured wallet. These bitcoin wallets can be opened only by its secret key. And if once the secret key of the wallet is lost, it cannot be recovered because of the irreversible nature of bitcoin transaction. To root out this problem, Goldfeder et al. [4] proposed a solution of threshold signature scheme compatible with bitcoins signature by using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) providing security policy of shared control of a wallet in which each player gets only a single share. Considering an important point of priority/weightage of players, Dikshit and Singh [12] first proposed a scheme in which each player is given one or more shares of the secret key according to his weightage/priority. This scheme has a drawback of managing and handling many keys by each player. Suppose a player has weightage w, then he possesses w different shares of secret key. This problem is resolved in the proposed scheme in this paper. We propose a scheme in which all the players get single share and can accomplish the requirements of concept of weightage. We extend the weighted threshold ECDSA scheme in order to realize efficient weighted threshold ECDSA scheme. © 2017 IEEE.",bitcoin; Bitcoin wallet; Cryptography; ECDSA; Shamir secret sharing; threshold signature scheme,Access control; Authentication; Electronic document identification systems; Electronic money; bitcoin; Bitcoin wallet; ECDSA; Secret sharing; Threshold signature schemes; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"ISEA Asia Secur.

Despite of huge efforts to protect sensitive data, hackers typically manage to steal it. Computing with encrypted data is strategies for safeguarding confidential data. The partial homomorphic encryption is specialized for only one operation on the encrypted data. For example the Pailliers encryption scheme performs only one mathematical operation on encrypted numerical data and is successful to compute the sum of encrypted values.

Conventional (2, n) random grid visual secret sharing (RG-VSS) scheme encrypts the secret image into n noise-like share images, called as shares. This scheme generates n shares with equal priorities; thus, decrypts the secret image by stacking any two shares. Recently, concept of two-tier (2, m, n) lock and key share RG-VSS scheme is established to enhance the security of conventional RG-VSS scheme. (2, m, n) scheme generates shares using binary secret image and splits into m lock and n key shares group. The secret image is disclosed only when at least one share is present from each group. The secret image can be revealed using OR-based and XOR-based decryptions. This paper extends the (2, m, n) RG-VSS scheme for grayscale and color images with two decoding option. When the computational device is not available, user gets the preview of the secret information by stacking the shares. User obtains improved visual quality of secret image when computational device is available.

These long keys are difficult to remember, hence, stored in smart card; tamper-resistant token, etc. or password based authentication method is used to control the access of cryptographic key. But these user selected passwords sometimes lost or guessed by dictionary attacks. Moreover, in symmetric cryptography, sender and receiver must have the same secret key and the key must be secured which leads to another threat of security. As a substitute to this, generation of cryptographic key using the biometric traits of both sender and receiver during the sessions of communication can be a possible solution of the above discussed key management problem. But the problem with biometrics is that once it gets compromised it cannot be reused. As a proficient solution for cancelling and reissuing biometric template cancelable biometrics has been proposed. The present work proposed to generate 128 bit symmetric key from cancelable fingerprint templates of both communicating parties. The current approach confirms the privacy of fingerprints by one way transformation of original template into cancelable one as well as resolves the difficulty of key storage and key distribution as the key is not sent to the recipient and is also not saved anywhere. © 2017 IEEE.",Biometrics; Cancelable template; Cryptographic key generation; Fingerprint biometrics; Symmetric cryptography,Access control; Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Smart cards; Cancelable biometrics; Cancelable templates; Cryptographic key; Fingerprint biometrics; Fingerprint templates; Key-management problem; Password-based authentication; Symmetric cryptography; Public key cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This is achieved by copying the data blocks to both main storage server and backup server simultaneously during the upload process. So that even if main storage server fails, the data needs of the user can be served by the backup server. Since the sensitive data as to be securely stored, instead of directly uploading the sensitive data file, the data file will be broken into data blocks and these blocks are encrypted and stored in the storage server. So that even if a intruder gains access to the storage server and tries to access the data, he will not be able to retrieve the data file as he cant determine which block belongs to which file and also the blocks are encrypted.

Instead of using standard S-boxes for implementation of nonlinear function, this paper considers a method on the basis of maximum length cellular automata (CA), so that enhanced security can be achieved with simple hardware structure. The proposed system adopts a lightweight random bit stream generator on the basis of linear feedback shift register (LFSR) for generating random error vectors, so that a large number of vectors with very good cryptographic properties can be made available with low hardware cost. Different permutation patterns generated for different message blocks help to provide good degrees of freedom for tuning security with reasonable key size. The hardware architecture for the proposed system is developed and validated through implementation on Xilinx Spartan 3S500E.

It is a technique that takes cryptography to the next level by concealing the presence of a message itself. Data Encryption Standard algorithm is such a cryptographic key which is applied to a block of plain text to convert it into a cipher text and vice-versa. This paper presents an innovative idea to hide a message within an image of any dimension by encrypting the message through Data Encryption Standard algorithm and concealing the message by applying LSB encoding technique in a spiral manner thus enhancing the difficulty of the decoder.

From the region of interest (ROI) of an iris image, distinctive features are strategically extracted for template creation. The significant part, i.e., the ROI of an iris image, is encrypted in a transformational domain and the nonsignificant region is encrypted in a spatial domain. The advantage of this encryption scheme is increased key space and high degree of security compared to 1-D chaos-based systems. Apart from security, another advantage is reduced computational time compared to conventional encryption schemes implemented in either the spatial or frequency domain. The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of increased key space due to transform orders of the fractional wavelet transform (FrWT) and complex dynamical characteristics of hyperchaos, making the proposed scheme resistant to attacks. The properties of the FrWT and hyperchaos complement each other, making the system efficient and highly robust. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the computational time without compromising the security. Further security analysis is done for various attacks such as differential, statistical, and perceptual attacks, which give promising results and indicate that the proposed encryption scheme is efficient and robust. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",4-D Lorenz hyper-chaotic system; Arnold cat map; biometrics; fractional wavelet transform; hyper-chaos,Biometrics; Chaotic systems; Digital storage; Frequency domain analysis; Image segmentation; Network security; Wavelet transforms; Cat map; Computational time; Dynamical characteristics; Encryption schemes; Fractional wavelet transforms; Hyper-chaotic systems; Hyperchaos; The region of interest (ROI); Cryptography,"Mehta, G.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amity University, Sector-125, India; email: gmehta@amity.edu",,Taylor and Francis Inc.,19393555,,,,English,Inf.

In this paper, we propose a new secure scan test architecture which isolates the encryption key whenever the cryptographic chip is switched to test mode. The encryption key remains isolated during the whole scan test process. It also clears the last functional states of the security sensitive scan cells as soon as the scan test mode is activated.

For secure communication, such applications often need an efficient group key establishment protocol to construct a common session key for group communications. Conventional group key transfer protocols depends on mutually trusted key generation center (KGC) to generate and distribute the group key to each participant in each session. However, those approaches require extra communication overheads in the server setup. This paper presents an efficient and secure group key transfer protocol using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The proposed protocol demonstrates a novel group key transfer protocol, in which one of the group member plays the role of KGC (the protocol without an online KGC, which is based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. The confidentiality of the proposed protocol is ensured by Shamir’s secret sharing, i.e., information theoretically secure and provides authentication using ECDLP. Furthermore, the proposed protocol resists against potential attacks (insider and outsider) and also significantly reduces the overheads of the system. The security analysis section of the present work also justifies the security attributes of the proposed protocol under various security assumptions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Authentication; Confidentiality; Group key transfer protocol; Secret sharing,Authentication; Geometry; Groupware; Information theory; Internet; Public key cryptography; Secure communication; Television broadcasting; Communication overheads; Confidentiality; Elliptic curve cryptography; Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC); Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems; Group key transfer protocols; Groupware applications; Secret sharing; Cryptography,"Jaiswal, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian school of MinesIndia; email: jaiswal.priyanka1985@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,19366442,,,,English,Peer-to-Peer Netw.

Still PKI ensures a secure method for exchanging sensitive information over unsecured channels through the use of cryptographic public private key pair, issued by Certification Authority (CA) but even an honest CA can issue forged certificate.

The ciphertext and key sizes achieved by our scheme are optimal - the size of the public parameters is independent of the size of the machine or data being encrypted, the secret key size depends only on the machine size and the ciphertext size depends only on the input size. Our scheme achieves full functional encryption in the ""private index model"", namely the entire input x is hidden (as against x being public and a single bit b being hidden). Our single key FE scheme can be compiled with symmetric key encryption as in [12] to yield reusable garbled DFAs for arbitrary size inputs, that achieves machine and input privacy along with reusability under a strong simulation based definition of security. We generalize this to a functional encryption scheme for Turing machines TMFE which has short public parameters that are independent of the size of the machine or the data being encrypted, short function keys, and input-specific decryption time. However, the ciphertext of our construction is large and depends on the worst case running time of the Turing machine (but not its description size). These provide the first FE schemes that support unbounded length inputs, allow succinct public and function keys and rely on LWE. Our construction relies on a new and arguably natural notion of decomposable functional encryption which may be of independent interest. © Shweta Agrawal and Ishaan Preet Singh;.",Deterministic Finite Automata; Functional Encryption; Garbled DFA; Learning With Errors,Finite automata; Machinery; Reusability; Security of data; Turing machines; Decryption time; Deterministic finite automata; Functional encryptions; Garbled DFA; Index models; Learning with Errors; Running time; Symmetric key encryption; Cryptography,,Muscholl A.Indyk P.Kuhn F.Chatzigiannakis I.,"Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9.78396E+12,,,English,"Leibniz Int.

To that end, they communicate interactively over a noiseless broadcast channel-each bit transmitted over this channel is received by all the parties. We give a universal interactive communication protocol, termed the recursive data exchange protocol (RDE), which attains omniscience for any sequence of data observed by the parties and provide an individual sequence guarantee of performance. As a by-product, for observations of length n, we show the universal rate optimality of RDE up to an O(n-1/2 ? log n) term in a generative setting where the data sequence is independent and identically distributed (in time). Furthermore, drawing on the duality between omniscience and secret key agreement due to Csiszár and Narayan, we obtain a universal protocol for generating a multiparty secret key of rate at most O(n-1/2 ? log n) less than the maximum rate possible. A key feature of RDE is its recursive structure whereby when a subset A of parties recover each-other's data, the rates appear as if the parties have been executing the protocol in an alternative model where the parties in A are collocated. © 2017 IEEE.",Data exchange protocols; Interactive communication; Secret key agreement; Universal compression,Electronic data interchange; Broadcast channels; Correlated data; Data exchange protocols; Individual sequences; Interactive communications; Recursive structure; Secret key agreement; Universal compression; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,189448,,IETTA,,English,IEEE Trans.

In particular, the ability to perform DPR over the network is essential in the context of a growing number of Internet of Things (IoT)-based and embedded security applications. However, the use of remote DPR brings with it a number of security threats that could lead to potentially catastrophic consequences in practical scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate four examples where the remote DPR capability of the FPGA may be exploited by an adversary to launch Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) attacks on commonly used security applications. We substantiate the threat by demonstrating remotely-launched attacks on Xilinx FPGA-based hardware implementations of a cryptographic algorithm, a true random number generator, and two processor based security applications - namely, a software implementation of a cryptographic algorithm and a cash dispensing scheme. The attacks are launched by on-the-fly transfer of malicious FPGA configuration bitstreams over an Ethernet connection to perform DPR and leak sensitive information.

The problem with encrypting data is we have to decrypt it for applying operations on files such as altering a word document or querying a statistical database containing financial data. Decrypting the data will leave it vulnerable. If we want to perform conditional based search queries in an encrypted data entire data should be decrypted to perform it, unless an order preserving scheme is used. There is no homomorphic encryption scheme which will allow us to perform conditional based queries without decrypting the entire data. In mathematical term homomorphic describes the changeover of one data set into another upholding the association between elements in both sets. Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) schemes are used extensively used in cryptography because of their usage in database design. But there is a chances of inference attack in case of OPE.

Secret sharing with steganography is a hot topic of discussion. In this paper, we proposed a secure image hiding scheme to deceive attacker using the concept of steganography and secret sharing. As to recover secret image, we have to apply decryption technique at two levels. Decryption at first level is done on the concept of secret sharing scheme. At first level, n+1 shared image are generated by using n cover images and a secret image. By performing operations on these n+1 shared images, we get n recovered images and one stego image, this process is homologousto classic secret sharing scheme. As the method is alike to secret sharing scheme, it deceives attacker and leads him to fall into our trap. He can consider that n recover images to be output and follow his lead, which will end in the wrong direction. But to recover the secret image, the output data from level one have to undergo through level two. In level two, we used the concept of steganography. The input to the second step is n recovered cover images and one stego image. The experimental result shows the proposed scheme is highly secured at both the levels, altering with any n shares will not reveal any partial information. For checking the effectiveness of proposed scheme, Correlation, MSE and PSNR techniques are used. The proposed scheme efficiently works for grayscale and coloured images. © 2016 IEEE.",,Cryptography; Recovery; Digital datas; Image hiding schemes; Output data; Partial information; Secret images; Secret sharing; Secret sharing schemes; Stego image; Steganography,"Deshmukh, M.; National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: marotideshmukh@nituk.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

It is possible to share data and to give authorized rights for decryption of any set of cipher text. Along with the encrypted data a searchable index is generated to provide search over the encrypted data. The data owner can share subset of files with other users by authorizing them an access rights and constant size of aggregate key. By doing this we are confidential about other outside files as those files cannot be decrypted using the given key. As per access rights search can be applied over restricted data set.

A study on implementation of meaningful shares in combination with visual cryptography scheme for secret images is carried out for implementation of algorithm. A visual cryptography techniques are used to create meaningful shares. We had used different algorithms to generate meaningful shares. These shares are watermarked with cover images. After transmission of these watermarked images to receiving end, the receiving end will extract the shares from watermarked images and stacking of these extracted meaningful shares will generate the original secret image.

DNA is an ultra compact information storage medium with high security and theoretically unbreakable algorithm. We present a new technique for securing the image using DNA computing. In practical steganography images can be broken with some assumption on the information theoretic entropy of the plaintext. We discuss a modified DNA sequencing algorithm for encoding image which appear to be more secure. The image is converted to DNA code and divide into fragments. The fragments are sorted and cloned as a bacterial library which acts as cipher.

Multi user data sharing should be secure and integrity should be achieved on cloud. To achieve the data security the methods like IBE (Identity Based Encryption), ABE (Attribute Based Encryption) etc. are widely used in cloud computing environment. However, the problems associated with IBE are extra overhead on private key generator (PKG) for computations required during the user revocation process. From the recent studies, there are two main research problems for cloud computing security such as security improvement using IBE and efficient IBE revocation process. The goal of this paper is to present framework to address both this research challenges. In this paper novel hybrid cloud security method is proposed in order to deliver both efficient revocation and enhanced security. This hybrid approach is combination of two well know security techniques such as IBE and ABE. The ABE method is combined with IBE to achieve the strong security against different threats. Along with user identity, his/her attributes like country or kind of subscription he/she has are used for further process of IBE encryption, decryption and revocation. Another problem of efficient identity revocation is further addressed by presenting the outsourcing computation into hybrid IBE (H-IBE) method at server aided settings. The other components and methods of proposed H-IBE are discussed during this paper and evaluated the performance against existing method. © 2016 IEEE.",ABE; Cloud Computing; Decryption; Encryption; Hybrid IBE; Key Generation; KU-CSP,Cloud computing; Embedded systems; Signal processing; Attribute-based encryptions; Cloud computing environments; Cloud computing securities; Cloud computing services; Decryption; Hybrid IBE; Identity Based Encryption; Key generation; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Saving protection of information claimed by gatherings is getting to be pivotal step by step. So security is the fundamental issue in secure multiparty computation. For secure multiparty computation mainly three methodologies are there: Oblivious Transfer, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secret Sharing. Among these three, secret sharing is better in terms of efficiency. Secret sharing is a method to safely share data between numerous gatherings. Secret is isolated into pieces, distribute among gatherings, and recuperated by the approved arrangement of gatherings. Secure multiparty can be executed in two ways: Centralized and Distributed. In a centralized way, risk of single point failure. That is, if central party is misbehaving then client's privacy cannot be kept up. Also, communication and computational cost is high. So, in this paper we proposed a new method in which secure multiparty is executed in a distributed environment and utilizing group mechanism between parties to preserve the user's privacy and this methodology will diminish the communication and computation cost. © 2016 IEEE.",Communication cost; Computation cost; Secret Sharing; Secure Multiparty Computation,Costs; Embedded systems; Signal processing; Communication cost; Computation costs; Computational costs; Distributed environments; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Secret sharing; Secure multi-party computation; Single point failure; Cryptography,"Patel, K.; Computer Engineering Department, MBICTIndia; email: Krp101992@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The wireless sensor networks are being widely used in agriculture, home security, health care monitoring and traffic management systems. Usage of these systems has increased rapidly. An organization or institute can make use of the data obtained from various such sensor network systems for their analysis. Data obtained from such networks can be misused by any person if the systems are not well secured. Thus misuse of valuable information raises many problems for organization or institute. So to tackle this problem, we need to secure the sensor network systems from vulnerable attacks. In this paper, we propose a new novel approach for securing wireless sensor networks with different layers of security along with data encryption / decryption strategies. As there is a huge concern regarding privacy and integrity of data, this approach will help the organizations to secure their information and make underlying wireless networks more secure and reliable.

Studies claim that there will be the existence of billions of internet connected devices in coming years. The small size and limited processing power of many connected devices could inhibit encryption and other robust security measure. Here cryptography plays a pivotal role. Also most of the devices available in the market today are resource constrained. Hence cryptographic solutions must be easy to implement and have high performance on a wide range of severely constrained devices. The relatively new field of lightweight cryptography provides significant advantages over existing algorithms when addressing security issues for highly constrained devices. In this project a detailed study of LBlock block cipher is done which is a lightweight cipher in both hardware and 8-bit platforms and an IP core is developed. The block size of LBlock is 64-bit and the key size is 80-bit and it can achieve competitive hardware and software performances when compared with other known lightweight block ciphers. The security evaluation shows that LBlock can achieve enough security margin against known attacks such as differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, impossible differential cryptanalysis and related-key attacks etc. LBlock cryptocore is designed, build and characterized for the efficient implementation in low resource devices. It can serve as a benchmark for the hardware design engineers to model devices that utilizes lightweight characteristics.

However, not all faults are exploitable and every exploitable fault is associated with an offline complexity to determine the key. The ideal fault attack would recover maximum key bits with minimum offline effort. Finding the ideal fault attack for a block cipher is a laborious manual task, which can take several months to years before such an attack is discovered. In this paper, we present a framework that would analyze block ciphers for their vulnerabilities to faults and automatically predict whether a differential fault attack would be successful. The framework, which we call XFC, uses colors to analyze the fault propagation and exploitability in the cipher. XFC would be able to (a) predict the key bits that can be derived by the fault attack and (b) estimate the offline complexity. It can thus be used to identify the ideal fault attack for a block cipher. As a proof of concept, we have applied XFC to the block ciphers AES, CLEFIA and SMS4 and were able to automatically derive fault attacks that correspond to the best known till date in the single fault model. © 2017 ACM.",Block Cipher; Fault Attack; Security Validation,Computer aided design; Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Side channel attack; Block ciphers; Differential fault attack; Fault characterization; Fault propagation; Proof of concept; Secret key; Security Validation; Single fault; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,0738100X,9.78145E+12,PDAWD,,English,Proc Des Autom Conf,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023593994

Generalized approaches dealing with location privacy, referred to as cloaking and obfuscation, are mainly based on a trusted third party, in which all the data remain available at a central server and thus complete knowledge of the query exists at the central node. This is the major limitation of such approaches; on the other hand, in trusted third-party-free framework clients collaborate with each other and freely communicate with the service provider without any third-party involvement. Measuring and evaluating trust among peers is a crucial aspect in trusted third-party-free framework. This paper exploits the merits and mitigating the shortcomings of both of these approaches. We propose a hybrid solution, HYB, to achieve location privacy for the mobile users who use location services frequently. The proposed HYB scheme is based on the collaborative preprocessing of location data and utilizes the benefits of homomorphic encryption technique. Location privacy is achieved at two levels, namely, at the proximity level and at distant level.

For the benefit of user, an improved security model for the data stored on the cloud is provided by encrypting the data even before uploading the file to the storage server. On the other side, the capacity of the cloud storage is optimally utilized by avoiding redundant storage of the same file on the server. Encrypting the same file by using two different algorithms produces two different encrypted files which in turn affects the performance by the de-duplication concept of the service provider. So an efficient mechanism which generates the hash value of the text and uses this hash value towards encrypting the data is proposed which uses hash values with unique file identifier. While the client uploads file to the cloud database, the unique id of the file is compared with those stored into the server. The proposed algorithm called Temporal Data De-duplication Algorithm (TDDdA) is used to get better performance of data storage in cloud. Since our approach is based on time, the read and write response time of the cloud data is linearly reduced. Increased security is achievable through our proposed model. © 2017 IEEE.",Cloud Computing; Cloud Database; Data De-duplication; Data Storage; Temporal Data,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Database systems; Cloud database; Data de duplications; Data storage; Data storage models; De duplications; Service provider; Storage servers; Temporal Data; Digital storage,"Muthurajkumar, S.; Department of Information Science and Technology, College of Engineering Guindy, Anna UniversityIndia; email: muthurajkumarss@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Evidently both human and the low cost pervasive devices cannot perform cryptographic authentication as they have inherent resource constraints. The human computer security can be used for pervasive devices and vice versa. This paper analyses the protocols based on HB and their strengths and weaknesses. The protocols are classified based on the mathematical structures used, attacks they are prone to and the suitability of application. The mathematical operations in each protocol determine the computation and communication cost of the protocol. Since energy conservation is a significant issue in RFID, the energy required for each protocol is studied. The cryptanalysis of the proposed protocols are studied and listed.

Diffie and Hellman introduced the concept of Public key cryptosystem, which uses two different keys for secure communication. Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman invented a public-key cryptosystem named as Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem (MHKC) which is an NP-complete combinatorial problem believed that computationally difficult to solve by intruders. All the public key elements are the modulus of multiples of super increasing sequence. Adi Shamir performs cryptanalysis and breaks the MHKC in polynomial time. In this paper, a novel public key cryptosystem based on MHKC (NPKC-MHKC) has been proposed, which is secure than MHKC. NPKC-MHKC consists of Public key, Private key, and Session key. Since all the three keys depend on each other, it is computationally infeasible for the intruder to break the cryptosystem. The performance analysis shows that the execution time of NPKC-MHKC is comparatively lesser than MHKC and security analysis proves that NPKC-MHKC is secure than MHKC. So, NPKC-MHKC can be implemented in High-performance computing applications. © 2017 IEEE.",Cryptosystem; Knapsack; Merkle-Hellman; Public key cryptography,Polynomial approximation; Public key cryptography; Combinatorial problem; High-performance computing applications; Knapsack; Merkle-Hellman; Performance analysis; Polynomial-time; Public key cryptosystems; Security analysis; Cryptography,"Thangavel, M.; Department of Information Technology, Thiagarajar College of EngineeringIndia; email: thangavelmuruganme@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this paper the plaintext is first divided into number of blocks and each block are first encrypted by Recursive Positional Substitution on Prime-Nonprime of Cluster (RPSPNC) and then the resultant blocks are encrypted by Triangular Encryption (TE). In RPSPNC source stream is divided into blocks and a generating function is applied on each block to generate a same size of intermediate block t, repetition of this generating function for finite number of time regenerates the original block. In TE, source stream is broken into blocks of size n, and then XNOR operation is performed from MSB to LSB generating a block of size n ? 1 and continues to form a triangle. Encryption is done in any of four types and decryption is done in similar method. Lastly combining all the encrypted blocks the ciphertext is generated. Thus applying cascaded approach much better result has been generated as compared to separate RPSPNC and TE. The results are also compared with State-of-art technique from literature, RCT, RMRO and much known RSA. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Block ciphers; Ciphertexts; Cryptographic algorithms; Finite number; Generating functions; Intermediate blocks; Number of blocks; Plaintext; Cryptography,"Chakraborty, R.; Department of CSE, Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Techno City, P.O.

Insecure internet as an underlying communication medium results in unlock of cryptographic attacks both from outsider (via Internet) and insider (via cloud system) on user and enterprise specific data. To combat these issues, we present a privacy preserving, hybrid profile authentication scheme exploiting Big Data features for a ubiquitous user connecting to cloud server through a smart device. Our system adopts the strengths of fuzzy hashing and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to authenticate and secure the critical user data stored in cloud servers from insiders and third party. We use user specific information like user password and behavioral features like key stroke dynamics to generate a user profile. Based on authors knowledge, our system i.e. PPMUAS is the first of its kind of system which considers multi factors and hybrid profile for privacy preserving and remote user authentication.

However, implementing even basic security features, like performing encryption on user data or using HTTPS while connection establishment, on such mobile applications, is often found to be absent either due to the lack of knowledge of user security concerns, or unavailability of security testing experts who can point out the security flaws in the applications. In this paper, we consider man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, a simple yet powerful attack, as a primary attack to test basic security features that a mobile banking application should impose. We have considered a total of 19 mobile banking applications on Android that are currently got deployed by public sector banks in India and are used by their respective customers. Surprisingly, the In about 90% of these banking applications, we have observed that the attack can be launched with ease even if the applications are using security protocols like HTTPS to establish a communication channel with their respective servers. Moreover, some mobile applications are using simple HTTP protocol to transfer user information without bothering anything about security. Hence, our analysis suggests that a level of revision is required to address the basic security flaws in the mobile banking applications to prevent even simple MitM attack. © 2016 IEEE.",,Android (operating system); Cellular telephone systems; Cryptography; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Security systems; Testing; Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack; Mobile applications; Mobile bankings; Security features; Security flaws; Security protocols; Security testing; User information; Mobile security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The PKI-based authentication protocols are strongly recommended for solving security issues in VANETs. However, they have following shortcomings: (1) lengthy certificates lead to transmission and computation overheads, and (2) lack of privacy-preservation due to revealing of vehicle identity, communicated in broadcasting safety-message. Symmetric cryptography based protocols are faster because of a single secret key and simplicity; however, it does not ensure non-repudiation. In this paper, we present an Efficient, Scalable and Privacy-preserving Authentication (ESPA) protocol for secure vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The protocol employs hybrid cryptography. In ESPA, the asymmetric PKI based pre-authentication and the symmetric hash message authentication code (HMAC) based authentication are adopted during vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications, respectively. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate proposed ESPA protocol and compared with the existing work based on PKI and HMAC. The performance analysis showed that ESPA is more efficient, scalable and privacy-preserving secured protocol than the existing work. © 2016 IEEE.",PKI; Privacy; Security; V2I; V2V; VANET,Access control; Ad hoc networks; Authentication; Cryptography; Data privacy; Public key cryptography; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Message authentication codes; Privacy-preserving authentication; Public-key infrastructure; Security; VANET; Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I); Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular communications; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Ergo, each system and process in Body Sensor Network (BSN) which accesses this data needs to be secured well enough. In order to achieve this high security along with low energy consumption, a key management scheme named as Double Encryption has been proposed here. The proposed method uses two keys for encryption: a novel physiological feature based key and a pre-shared key between the communicating nodes. The feature and key generation, both are more economical than the existing algorithms in terms of computation, communication, storage, security and error. The features are exchanged with the help of simple addition and subtraction, instead of heavy computations like a vault or coffer creation, commitment, encryption or decryption. The another salient feature of the proposed algorithm is that if the key negotiation fails once, the protocol does not need to be restarted.

Due to exploration of different types of vulnerabilities, day by day threat of attacks in network is increasing. There is possibility of getting system infected by internal or external intruders. Single computer system is shared by multiple users. Users use multiuser system by creating their own account, which is protected by unique id and password. Sometimes, authorized users attack system for some malicious purposes. Internal attacks include deleting some important files or data, altering some important data. For any intrusion detection system, it is very difficult to identify authorized internal intruders. SQL injection is one such attack, which can be launched by internal attacker. The purpose of external intruder is to perform malicious activities in remote system. To avoid these two types of attacks, the robust intrusion detection system is needed. In this paper, we have implemented hybrid intrusion detection system, which includes identification of both internal and external attacks. Signature matching algorithm is implemented to identify internal attacks. Fuzzy genetic algorithm is applied for implementation of external attacks detection.

By this algorithm, we use those bits of image RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LSB (Least significant Bit) values which are same as the value of message to be hidden. It implies that those bits of image are remembered which are same as bit of message to be encrypted.

Very huge amount of data is stored at cloud storage servers by various users or organizations. With such services, various key issues are arises such as data security, confidentiality. To overcome these, the key concept was introduced such as Cryptography. In cryptography, various keys are used to encrypt or decrypt the data before uploading or downloading from cloud server. To generate the private and public key pair, distributed key generation (DKG) protocol was introduced. But within organization there is another issue is arises, regarding to authority based data access control policy. That is only user with particular authority can access data stored at cloud, based on their authority level. For this hierarchical threshold access structure (HTAS) is used along with DKG, known as HTDKG. In this, various users are divided into levels based on their designation and some threshold is assigned. At the time of data access, only specific levels users can access the specific amount of data. Because of this, all data is not revealed to any unconcern user. In existing system, HTDKG key generation and management is perform at user side which increases the management overhead. To overcome this issue, we introduced the third party Key Distribution Center (KDC), which execute the HTDKG protocol and take responsibility of all key generation, distribution and management activities.

Internet of Things (IoT's) is an emerging application area for semiconductors in which security is a prime concern. Identity or authentication of a device in the network of millions of devices in IoT's is very important. In this paper, we present Secure Split Test with functional testing capability (SSTF) scheme to mitigate the counterfeits coming out from untrusted foundries. The SSTF is suitable for low cost/low end devices. To address the identity management issue in IoT's and counterfeiting of ICs, a Physical Unclonable Function based SSTF (PUF-SSTF) is presented. PUF-SSTF is suitable for ICs targeted to use in smart phones and IoT ‘s. PUF-SSTF is a security solution to address: mitigating the counterfeit ICs coming out from untrusted foundries, identity management in IoT's and licensing the device features, which will benefit the fabless semiconductor vendors for licensing and entitlement management. The proposed SSTF and PUF-SSTF techniques are implemented in both ASIC and FPGA and security analysis is performed. The security analysis results are in par with earlier secure split test techniques like Connecticut Secure Split Test (CSST). The proposed techniques will create the comprehensive secure supply chain solution, which will benefit fabless semiconductor vendor and end-user. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Counterfeiting; Hardware metering; Identity and authentication in IoT; Physical unclonable functions; Secure split test,Access control; Authentication; Copyrights; Cryptography; Foundries; Hardware security; Integrated circuits; Security systems; Semiconductor device manufacture; Smartphones; Supply chains; Testing; Timing circuits; Counterfeiting; Critical applications; Emerging applications; Hardware metering; Identity and authentication in IoT; Semiconductor manufacturing; Semiconductor vendors; Split test; Internet of things,"Kumar, K.S.email: kumar.sudeendra@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,1679260,,IVJOD,,English,Integr VLSI J,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85001907725

In MCC, mobile users access the cloud services with the mobile device. Generally, the users of mobile cloud can select their services from the broker using an agent. There is an agreement between the users and service provider called SLA. Data are of varying types and they require different security levels based on their requirement. Classification of Mobile user’s data is a time-consuming process. A superior naive classifier for secure data classification in agent based mobile cloud computing is proposed in this paper. The agent classifies the user’s data into three different groups namely, low, medium, high. Then, the data are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standards (AES). Encrypted data is transferred to the broker for selecting for suitable service agent.But the broker has many to one relationship with service agents. Then the data is sent to the cloud service provider for storage. The stored data is then homomorphically encrypted which enables the cloud provider and cloud user to process the data without the need for decryption. Performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed method reduces classification time and provides better security and integrity on mobile cloud data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Advanced encryption standards; Homomorphic encryption; Mobile cloud computing; Superior naive classifier; Ubiquitous computing,Big data; Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Embedded systems; Mobile devices; Ubiquitous computing; Advanced Encryption Standard; Classification time; Cloud service providers; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Mobile users access; Naive classifiers; Performance analysis; Service provider; Mobile cloud computing,"Arvind, K.S.; Anna UniversityIndia; email: erodearvind@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13867857,,,,English,Cluster Comput.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014245407

Breakable and controllable structures for main AES blocks at the gate level are designed and used here. The control unit using high speed combinational logic circuit is designed to control the AES structural architecture. Modified MUX based S-Box is introduced in AES instead of S-Box to reduce the area without affecting the throughput. In addition Encryption process Mix-columns transformation is modified to reduce the hardware complexity. The five stage subpipelining is introduced in AES MUX based S-Box with six pipelining stages in AES encryption process to increase throughput further. The aim of this work is to investigate both the existing and new architectures. The modified MUX based S-Box for Rijndael algorithm has been used in the 128-bit AES encryption process. The role of five stage sub-pipelined MUX based S-Box of 128-bit pipelined AES is to reduce the critical path delay to minimum for achieving high clock frequency. The rows of multiplexer in AES architecture were used for the breaking and controlling of the design. The modified 128-bit encryption was implemented on Virtex-4, Virtex-5, and Spartan 3 FPGA Devices. The results of the proposed architecture are analysed, throughput and area for the implemented design are calculated.

In this paper, we have depicted two efficient encryption algorithms that meet security demand in cloud. Probabilistic encryption, one of these algorithms may be used to produce randomness of text encryption. With this algorithm, if the same message is encrypted twice it should yield different secret coded texts on both calculations. Another crucial algorithm is homomorphic encryption, is a cryptographic method to define the sample system and to provide a software implementation. In order to maintain quality of service (QoS) and improve customer satisfaction, we are going to propose an efficient algorithm which combines the characteristics of both probabilistic and homomorphic encryption techniques, to provide high level of security.

The service provider shares two copies for single information (specifically image for this work). One copy is a low-resolution version which is shared in the public domain for preview purpose. The other one is a high-resolution version to be provided to the customers through a secure channel on demand (after payment). We propose a novel scheme that can be efficiently adapted in such a scenario. We analyze the images in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain and note that polynomials of suitable degree, representing the sorted DCT coefficients together with original index locations, can uniquely represent an image. We show that the arrangement of DCT index locations, after the actual coefficients have been sorted by magnitude, is significantly different for various images and we exploit this to design an efficient CAS-based scheme. We also show that the amount of private data, which a service provider needs to transmit through a secure channel to the customers on demand, is reduced significantly. This reduction in transmitted data makes the system apt for real-time secure applications. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Conditional access; Discrete cosine transform (DCT); Image on demand; Polynomial curve fitting; Selective encryption,Cryptography; Curve fitting; Data privacy; Image compression; Location; Polynomial approximation; Conditional access; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); On demands; Polynomial curve fitting; Selective encryption; Discrete cosine transforms,"Meenpal, T.; Reactor Control Division, BARC Mumbai, (Aegis) HBNIIndia; email: toshan.barc@gmail.com",,Springer Verlag,18618200,,,,English,J.

One such image encryption scheme based on a Permutation Ordered Binary Number System has been proposed in this work. It distributes the image information in totally random shares, which can be stored at the cloud data centers. Further, the proposed scheme authenticates the shares at the pixel level. If any tampering is done at the cloud servers, the scheme can accurately identify the altered pixels via authentication bits and localizes the tampered area. The tampered portion is also reflected back in the reconstructed image that is obtained at the authentic user end.

Generally, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are susceptible to various attacks like gray hole attack, black hole attack, selective packet dropping attack, Sybil attack, and flooding attack. Therefore, the wireless network should be protected using encryption, firewalls, detection schemes to identify the attackers and decreasing their impact on the network. So, it’s an essential task to design the intelligent intrusion detection system. This research work deals with designing the multilevel trust based intelligence intrusion detection system with cryptography schemes for detecting the attackers. In order to identify the attackers, we propose a novel trust management with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm. At first, a trust manager is maintained, its functions is to classify the trust into three different sets of trust level based upon the elliptic curve cryptography and Schnorr’s signature in the MANET. Each trust level has identified a single attacker. Thus, the proposed method has detected three types of attackers such as black hole attack, flooding attack and selective packet dropping attack. Furthermore, it have provided countermeasure for these attackers in the MANET as well as improved performances. Hence, it obtains higher throughput, minimum delay, minimum packet loss and efficient end to end delivery in MANET.

In this paper we have proved that Gope and Hwang scheme is vulnerable to stolen smart card attack, offline password guessing attack, forgery attack and replay attack.

It is necessary to design suitable countermeasures to protect cryptographic primitives against such attacks. This paper focuses on designing encryption schemes that are innately secure against fault analysis. The paper formally proves that one such design strategy, namely the use of key-dependent S-Boxes, is only partially secure against DFA. The paper then examines the fault tolerance of encryption schemes that use a key-independent secret tweak value for randomization. In particular, the paper focuses on a linear tweak based and a non-linear tweak based version of a recently proposed block cipher DRECON. The paper demonstrates that while both versions are secure against classical DFA, the non-linear tweak based version provides greater fault coverage against stronger fault models. This fact, together with the DPA resistance provided by the use of variable S-Boxes, makes DRECON a strong candidate for the design of secure cryptographic primitives. All claims have been validated by experimental results on a SASEBO GII platform. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Countermeasures; DFA; DPA; DRECON; Fault attacks; S-Box; Secret tweaks; Security,Cryptography; Fault tolerance; Radar countermeasures; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic primitives; DRECON; Encryption schemes; S-Box; Secret tweaks; Security; Side-channel analysis; Side channel attack,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,"ACM Int.

Hence the broadcast of electronic medical images over internet has become frequent. Due to lack of security levels in internet broadcast of electronic medical image is always susceptible to hackers and other breaches of security. Ensuring the security, integrity and robustness of digital medical image has become an important issue. In this paper a novel approach is proposed using Chao's theories and DNA encoding to provide the security for digital medical images. In the proposed method, firstly the input medical image is revamped into two DNA encoded matrices based on intensity levels. Later, for odd pixel value based DNA encoded matrix Chen's hyper chaotic map and for even pixel value based DNA encoded matrix Lorenz chaotic map are used to produce the chaotic sequences separately. The pixels positions of both DNA encoded matrices are snarled using these chaotic sequences. Finally, ADD operation is used for the addition of snarled both DNA encoded matrices to attain an encrypted image. The decrypted image is acquired by inverse process of encryption. From the experimental results it is proved that proposed algorithm enhances the security level. It sustains the integrity, robustness and efficiency of digital medical image encryption. © 2016 IEEE.",Chen's hyper chaotic map; Cryptography; decryption; DNA; medical mage encryption,Artificial intelligence; Broadcasting; Chaotic systems; Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital communication systems; DNA; DNA sequences; Image coding; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Medical imaging; Personal computing; Pixels; Chaotic map; Chaotic sequence; decryption; Digital communication networks; Digital medical images; Dna cryptographies; Internet broadcast; Medical image encryptions; Medical image processing,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

In order to increase the level of security and safety in VANETs, in this paper, we propose a Privacy Preservation and Authentication on Secure Geographical Routing Protocol (PPASGR) for VANET. It provides security by detecting and preventing malicious nodes through two directional antennas such as forward (f-antenna) and backward (b-antenna). The malicious nodes are detected by direction detection, consistency detection and conflict detection. The location of the trusted neighbour is identified using TNT-based location verification scheme after the implementation of the Vehicle Tamper Proof Device (VTPD), Trusted Authority (TA) is generated that produces the anonymous credentials. Finally, VTPD generates pseudo-identity using TA which retrieves the real identity of the sender. Through this approach, the authentication, integrity and confidentiality for routing packets can be achieved.

There are many security problems exist in communication technology which are very critical. One such problem is related to the confidentiality of the message exchange in web. The two prevalent strategies to provide message secrecy are Cryptography and Steganography. Cryptography conceals the existence of the message and the steganography mutilates the message itself. In this paper, we are mainly focusing on the strength of combining cryptographic and steganographic principles in enhancing the security of web based transactions. Web browser is the basic client side application that we use to execute such critical and noncritical transactions. Mozilla Firefox is one of the most popular open source web browsers and various studies reveals that more than sixty percentage of the web users are depending on this browser. There are certain security plug-ins available for Firefox browser but the one which integrates cryptographic and steganographic features is still missing.

This paper proposes a tagged visual cryptography for color images, where the secret image is splitted into two base shares based on the traditional visual cryptography scheme. The generated base shares are stamped with the tag pattern using the probabilistic visual cryptography scheme to obtain the tagged shares. One of the main advantage of using tag patterns is providing the participants with augmented information to identify the relevant shares among the numerous shares.

Outsourcing the data to cloud storage servers ease the client accountability by facilitating stumpy cost, secure, locality independent platforms and scalable resources. With the proliferation of cloud technologies, outsourced data is scrolling among the nodes, client unaware of storage location and no longer have possession of data. Data privacy and integrity are formidable concerns for data owners. So, verification of data integrity is vital. Thus, an efficient auditing scheme is required to guarantee data possessor so as to assure them data safety and accuracy. In this paper, we propose zero knowledge proof interactive system for data integrity verification on cloud. Our method strengthened by using Homomorphic encryption tags, generated on encrypted data with zero knowledge to the interactive members. We consider TPA (Third Party Auditor) as audit agent inside the cloud on behalf of client to reduce the communication cost. The scheme drastically reduces input and output costs by generating the probabilistic proof of possession using sampling sets of data blocks from the server. Client maintains meta data of file for verification, which reduces huge communication cost on network. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show the efficiency of the scheme for integrity proofs. © 2016 IEEE.",Cloud Storage; Data Integrity; Homomorphic Encryption; TPA; Verification Tags,Artificial intelligence; Cost reduction; Costs; Cryptography; Data privacy; Cloud storages; Cloud technologies; Communication cost; Data integrity; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Information technology application; Interactive system; Zero knowledge proof; Digital storage,,Karthikeyan M.Krishnan N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Wireless technology is the one that will help an emergency needy like in any natural disaster, emergency rescue operations, military battle-field etc. With the advent of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks, an immediate self-configuring network can be created. Being an open network, security is the main concern for MANETs. In such situations to protect the confidentiality of the message to be transmitted, cryptography is the one of the solution. The process of converting the original data into a secret form is known as cryptography. It hides the actual information and sends the encrypted message. At the destination end, the message can be recovered by using decryption. Here we are proposing a new encryption technique named as Letter-Shape Encryption.

Cloud computing virtualizes system by pooling and sharing resources. Customers store their data on the cloud using resources and they provide the access of data to the users. Cloud computing has to ensure the security of the data stored in the cloud. Access to the data stored in the cloud is provided through access controls defined by data owner while storing the data in the cloud. Access control models using access controls specified by the data owner will monitor access to the data on the cloud. Earlier various traditional access control models are proposed and they are not sufficient for the cloud environment. Cloud environment supports remote access for computation, storage etc. Cloud computing demands attribute based encryption-Access control models. Various access control models are proposed using attribute encryption namely KP-ABE, CP-ABE, HASBE. These access control models are static in nature. In this paper, we propose a dynamic attribute-based risk aware access control model which can be hybridized with the above access control models. Our model combines risk computation with attributes used for access control.

In a typical system it will be performed through exchange of mails or post, it is a time consuming process and not foolproof due to human intervention. In an online system, the documents hosted on a third party server with negligible downtime guarantee will be downloaded and verified. But in such cases the trustworthiness of the documents hosted on these servers is questionable as the documents will be hosted in its original format and there are chances that it will be modified or altered. Trusting and protecting the documents from getting modified due to intentional attacks and other possible attacks are the issues to be addressed in online document verification system. To overcome these issues and design a foolproof system, in this paper, we propose an online document verification system based on Attribute Based Encryption (ABE).

Stream ciphers constitute a popular choice for ensuring security of data communications in such applications. To keep the cost, complexity and energy expenditure in the implementation of such stream cipher algorithms low, the short duration of the wireless communication sessions are often exploited by using a lightweight cryptographic (LWC) algorithm. Such an LWC algorithm will provide the desired security during the short session at the required speed, and a new key will be used for the next session so that an adversary would not have enough time to decipher the key of any session. In this paper, we propose a technique based on generating stream of random keys from streaming twitter data. The sequence of random keys generated by the proposed tweet-based key generation (TBKG) algorithm has been tested by the NIST statistical test suite for randomness. The test results show that TBKG algorithm passes all the fifteen tests for randomness. Also, the period of the key values is quite high, thus making it suitable for use over short sessions involving communication of 350 MB data through the wireless network. The unpredictability of the generated random key values is governed by the unpredictable nature of the tweets from thousands of individuals. The algorithm is very simple to implement with low computational and energy overhead. © 2017 IEEE.",Internet of Things; Key generation; Lightweight cryptography; Mobile transactions; Stream cipher; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks,Cryptography; Random processes; Security of data; Social networking (online); Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Key generation; Light-weight cryptography; Mobile transaction; Stream Ciphers; Wireless communications; Internet of things,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

DFA uses pairs of fault-free and faulty ciphertexts to recover the secret key. DFIA, on the other hand, combines principles of side-channel analysis and fault attacks to try and extract the key using faulty ciphertexts only. Till date, no effective countermeasure that can thwart both DFA-as well as DFIA-based attacks has been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. In particular, traditional redundancy-based countermeasures that assume uniform fault distributions are found to be vulnerable against the DFIA due to its use of biased fault models. In this paper, we propose a novel generic countermeasure strategy that combines the principles of redundancy with that of fault space transformation to achieve security against both DFA-and DFIA-based attacks on AES-like block ciphers. As a case study, we have applied our proposed technique to obtain temporal and spatial redundancy-based countermeasures for AES-128, and have evaluated their security against both DFA and DFIA via practical experiments on a SASEBO-GII board. Results show that our proposed countermeasure makes it practically infeasible to obtain a single instance of successful fault injection, even in the presence of biased fault models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",biased faults; block ciphers; countermeasure; fault attacks; fault space transformation; redundancy; Security,Cryptography; Lyapunov methods; Redundancy; Security of data; Standards; Block ciphers; countermeasure; Countermeasure strategies; Differential fault analyses (DFA); Fault space; Security; Side-channel analysis; Temporal and spatial redundancies; Side channel attack,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15566013,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

These techniques however consume substantial processing time for the medical images. A new lossless encryption technique using quaternions can be adopted which reduces the processing time enormously. The quaternion technique is implemented using counter mode of encryption and modular arithmetic operations. The security of the medical image transmission can even be enhanced by incorporating digital watermarking which serves as an authentication of the sender and also reduces the difficulty in maintenance of multiple documents.

From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things.

The advent of cloud computing has pushed the limits of sharing across geographical boundaries, and has enabled a multitude of users to contribute and collaborate on shared data. However, protecting online data is critical to the success of the cloud, which leads to the requirement of efficient and secure cryptographic schemes for the same. Data owners would ideally want to store their data/files online in an encrypted manner, and delegate decryption rights for some of these to users, while retaining the power to revoke access at any point of time. An efficient solution in this regard would be one that allows users to decrypt multiple classes of data using a single key of constant size that can be efficiently broadcast to multiple users.

The sharing of digital images, involving orders, reports and sensitive information are becoming increasingly difficult to prevent unauthorized access and to avoid data forgery. The very danger of unauthorized access and its blatant use against national security is imminent. If any third party gets the secret message, they can alter the contents and transfer this to destination. The secrecy of the digital images will be lost due to this unauthorized access. So military images should maintain the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity. For this, military communication should ensure the use of efficient and robust cryptographic techniques. This research proposes a four pronged security system that combines the use of two algorithms viz. Reversible Data Hiding and Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm to ensure integrity, authentication and security of digital images. © 2016 IEEE.",Military communication; Reversible data hiding; Shamir secret scheme,Authentication; Bandwidth; Cryptography; Military communications; Military photography; National security; Personal computing; Steganography; Available bandwidth; Cryptographic techniques; Reversible data hiding; Secret messages; Secret sharing algorithm; Sensitive informations; Shamir secret scheme; Unauthorized access; Electronic document exchange,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Visual cryptography is a technique to hide the image based secret. In visual cryptography the secret image is encrypted in to shares and at decryption side all shares are superimposed with each other so that secret is revealed. The key feature of visual cryptography is that, no difficult computation is needed at decryption side to decrypt the secret. In this paper we are applying Hierarchical Visual Cryptography Scheme on gray image instead of binary image. So, generated shares are gray share, not binary shares that are generated by the binary image. Here we are using the new proposed gray share generation algorithm for generation of n number of shares. Here original image is encrypted in to n number of levels so security of original image is increased. At decryption side all n shares must have to participate to reveal the original secret. Decrypted image has same size and better visual quality then original secret image. © 2016 IEEE.",Pixel expansion; Secret image sharing; Visual cryptographic scheme; Visual cryptography,Bins; Cryptography; Integrated circuits; Cryptographic schemes; Gray-scale images; Pixel expansion; Secret image sharing; Share generation; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Visual qualities; Binary images,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Key management is a major categorisation and includes several important elements namely, key updating, key distribution and most importantly key generation. Most of the physically deployed WSN has been deployed with pre distributed random keys which are seldom updated. This proves a challenge to the underlying encryption algorithm which gets subjected to cryptanalysis and thus loses its viability. The connectivity provided in WSN contradicts the network security principle of resilience and research community has not been able to provide viable alternatives to key updating. To address this problem a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) based random key management scheme is proposed for heterogeneous WSN is proposed. Deployment details are pre-requisitely known and a RSSI-LQI based random key distribution and key updating mechanism is designed. The simulation and analysis of this mechanism achieves improved security and supports scalability. This mechanism also assures key network security features of key updating without affecting the major concerns of resilience and connectivity at the network security level. © 2016 IEEE.",Keying Algorithm; Link Quality Indicator; MISTY1; Received Signal Strength Indicator; Scalability; Symmetric Key Encryption,Cryptography; Integrated circuits; Public key cryptography; Scalability; Wireless sensor networks; Encryption algorithms; Key management schemes; Link quality indicators; MISTY1; Random key distribution; Received signal strength indicators; Simulation and analysis; Symmetric key encryption; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Modern era has seen the rise of computing devices, especially hand held devices. Information, in large quantity, can be digitalized and stored on these devices. Also these information must be shared to others devices, connected either via wired or wireless links, which are insecure channels. Information is a long term resource to any individual and/or organization and hence privacy of the information is of great importance. Privacy can be achieved by applying any cryptographic approaches, which transforms meaningful data into meaningless form. There are different ciphers like DES, RC's, AES and so on, which provide high confidentiality of message but these cannot be used on devices which have small amount of processing power and memory. This paper proposes a new symmetric key block cipher which can be used on large as well as small devices. The new cipher has a block cipher of 160-bit and the enciphering of plain-text takes place using 160-bit key, in 8 rounds. The confusion concept is brought into the cipher using a s-box which is dynamic in nature and the s-box contents depend on the key. For each round, the s-box contents vary thereby bringing in strong resilience against basic attacks. The cipher possesses simple XOR-ing operations, which is fast, making it ideal for all kinds of applications. © 2016 IEEE.",AES; Confusion; Cryptographic approaches; Digitization,Analog to digital conversion; Integrated circuits; Security of data; Standards; Computing devices; Confusion; Cryptographic approaches; Hand held device; Processing power; Small devices; Symmetric block ciphers; Symmetric keys; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

So data hiding is used in the encrypted image, but the main problem is that distortion at the time of data extraction. Reversible data hiding in encrypted image is used to solve this problem. SDS Algorithm gives more security to secret data. RDH recovers the original image after the extraction of the embedded data. In this paper, XOR ciphering technique used for encryption and decryption process. All existing mechanisms embed data by reversibly vacating room after the encrypted images. However, this may result in some errors on data extraction and/or image restoration. In this paper, we suggest a method by holding a space before encryption with a RDH algorithm. Thus, the data hider can embed data in the encrypted image. The embedded data can be data or image. Both data extraction and image recovery will be formed without any error. The transmission and exchange of image also demands high security.

With the increasing population density it is difficult to have a real time tracking of health condition of people in an area. Traditional offline method such as using medical survey and making medical records manually are inefficient. In this project hardware for continuous health monitoring and alert system is developed. Different sensors are used to measure various parameters from human body. Reading taken from ECG is huge and is hard to handle, so a compression algorithm is used to compress the readings taken from patient's body. To ensure the security and privacy of patient's health status it is critical to secure the data collected from the person's body, for this we are using Knapsack cryptography algorithm.

The advanced encryption standard (AES) is one of the three cryptographic algorithms used in 4G networks for encryption of sensitive data. In spite of offering high immunity, AES is still vulnerable to few attacks. This weakness in AES algorithm makes 4G susceptible to several security issues. This paper specifically focuses on fault attacks performed on AES. A fault induced in any one of the rounds of AES helps the attacker to derive information about the secret key. In this manner, these fault attacks pose a serious threat to wireless mobile communication as he or she may gain access to any network that is encrypted with AES. In earlier works, various countermeasures have been suggested to prevent them. However, each of these preventive measures has their own limitations and vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an enhanced method of preventing fault attacks in AES by incorporating a combination of non-linear and linear diffusion techniques. This method identifies if a fault has been injected and diffuses the fault well into the matrix, providing no information about the secret key to the attacker. The performance evaluation proves that the proposed prevention method outperforms the others in terms of time, cost and efficiency.",Advanced encryption standard; Diffusion technique; Fault attack; Long term evolution,4G mobile communication systems; Data privacy; Diffusion; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Side channel attack; Wireless telecommunication systems; Advanced Encryption Standard; Cryptographic algorithms; Fourth generation (4G); Mobile Technology; Prevention methods; Preventive measures; Wireless communications; Wireless mobile communications; Cryptography,,,Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre,0011748X,,DSJOA,,English,Def.

This is a challenge-response protocol, or a question answering method that needs the users to do some form of cognitive functions or cognitive operations. By using the timing attack on the Hopper Blum method we can show that this authentication scheme is not secure against observation attack. And provide a pictorial or graphical authentication scheme with the help of the Hopper Blum method. Also propose more security enhancements of these schemes. The enhancements show the existence of a strong tradeoff between security and usability, indicating that the safety of cognitive authentication methods comes in a non-negligible usability cost.

It is envisaged that the proposed encryption model would enable a range of IoT devices to transfer data or to communicate more securely over open/insecure communication channel and also to provide enhanced data integrity. The model keeps the size of output cipher text unchanged by XORing the parity bits to avoid the overhead and making it lightweight. The chaotic dynamical system was used for key scheming to produce highly sensitive cipher text. Further, the key is dynamically updated using the same parity to increase the reliance of output cipher text on the input plain text. The key with 128-bit length is used for data complexity which is widely known and proven to withstand any kind of brute force attack. Finally, diffusion process was implemented to ensure the effect of any change is retained and carried throughout the process. The simulation results yield average NPCR value to be 99.7113, which demonstrates the potential of the model to be used for IoT based devices and systems where high complexity for data security is required.

The distributed nature and dynamic topology of WSN introduces very special requirements in conserving energy and providing security. To address these challenges, technique like secure and energy efficient clustering scheme with data aggregation has been developed. The comparison between LEACH, M-LEACH and the proposed scheme with result analysis is presented in this paper. In this paper, we implement energy efficient clustering scheme [1][2][4][12][15][17][19] with aggregation of information to save the bandwidth requirement, which prolongs the lifetime of a network [8]. The proposed algorithm operates in two-phases. In the first phase clustering is done, in which sensor nodes compute potential score which is based on mobility pattern, density [5] and remaining energy [5] [8] in disseminated manner, then each node decides to become a cluster head(CH), by employing potential score. In second phase, every node chooses its CH [5] which has higher potential score. All cluster members will transmits the data to cluster heads for aggregation and encryption, which is then forwarded to the base station. The results proved that the proposed algorithm has better throughput, packet delivery ratio with reduced packet drop, lesser energy consumption and ensures data security compared with LEACH. © 2016 IEEE.",Clustering; Data aggregation; LEACH; MDC; Security; WSN,Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Leaching; Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; Data aggregation; Energy Efficient clustering; Mobile wireless sensor network; Packet delivery ratio; Secure data aggregations; Security; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Due to the hostile environment, security is major concern while data transmission. In order to overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose hop by hop group key agreement protocol where each node generates pairwise key for encryption of data. The session key is generated only between the nodes which is carrying the data packet for transmission. The key exchange can be performed between two nodes before data transmission. Ni constructs Lagrange interpolating polynomial with degree n ? 1. Each Ni broadcasts the generated polynomial. After that, group key agreement protocol is used to provide complete authentication for those nodes.

At the heart of this ecosystem is the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which in turn uses the X.509 publickey infrastructure and numerous cryptographic constructions and algorithms. Unfortunately, this ecosystem is extremely brittle, with headline-grabbing attacks and emergency patches many times a year. We describe our ongoing efforts in Everest1 a project that aims to build and deploy a verified version of TLS and other components of HTTPS, replacing the current infrastructure with proven, secure software. Aiming both at full verification and usability, we conduct high-level code-based, game-playing proofs of security on cryptographic implementations that yield efficient, deployable code, at the level of C and assembly. Concretely, we use F? a dependently typed language for programming, meta-programming, and proving at a high level, while relying on low-level DSLs embedded within F? for programming low-level components when necessary for performance and, sometimes, sidechannel resistance. To compose the pieces, we compile all our code to source-like C and assembly, suitable for deployment and integration with existing code bases, as well as audit by independent security experts. Our main results so far include (1) the design of Low?, a subset of F? designed for C-like imperative programming but with high-level verification support, and KreMLin, a compiler that extracts Low? programs to C; (2) an implementation of the TLS-1.3 record layer in Low?, together with a proof of its concrete cryptographic security; (3) Vale, a new DSL for verified assembly language, and several optimized cryptographic primitives proven functionally correct and side-channel resistant. In an early deployment, all our verified software is integrated and deployed within libcurl, a widely used library of networking protocols. © Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Barry Bond, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, Cédric Fournet, Chris Hawblitzel, Catalin Hritcu, Samin Ishtiaq, Markulf Kohlweiss, Rustan Leino, Jay Lorch, et al.; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY.",Cryptography; Security; TLS; Verification,Codes (symbols); Concretes; Cryptography; Digital subscriber lines; Ecology; Ecosystems; High level languages; HTTP; Object oriented programming; Program compilers; Seebeck effect; Side channel attack; Thallium; Verification; Cryptographic implementation; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic security; Imperative programming; Networking protocols; Public key infrastructure; Security; Transport layer security protocols; C (programming language),,Bodik R.Lerner B.S.Krishnamurthi S.,"Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9.78396E+12,,,English,"Leibniz Int.

However, WSNs are vulnerable to various attacks over wireless links, such as eavesdropping and tampering. How to ensure that sensitive or critical information is only available to legal users becomes a challenging issue. Two-factor authentication combining password and smart card perfectly matches this requirement because of its practicality. However, a dozen of two-factor authentication protocols have been suggested in recent years. Owing to the challenging mission of reconciling efficiency and security requirements, it is still challenging to propose a privacy-aware two-factor protocol that is capable of providing various security features while maintaining acceptable efficiency. In this paper, we put forward a privacy-aware two-factor authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography for WSNs. Our new protocol accomplishes various security features necessary for real-life application environments while maintaining acceptable efficiency. We prove that the new protocol fulfills mutual authentication in the Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic. Additionally, by way of informal security analysis, we show that the new protocol can withstand a variety of attacks and provide desirable security features. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Majority of the cryptosystems use Modular Multiplication and Modular Exponentiation to bring about the encryption. Efficient hardware implementation of this is a necessity however is difficult as implementation of modular operations in hardware consumes large areas and power. Montgomery method does faster Modular Multiplications by converting numbers to special representations (Residual Number System) where multiplications and divisions are done by shift operations. This paper presents the modular exponential techniques in higher radix namely, radix-4 and radix-8. These algorithms are compatible to the hardware implementations. The modular multiplications involved in modular exponentiation are evaluated with the help of Montgomery multiplication method. We have introduced modifications in the existing Montgomery method and named as Adapted Montgomery Multiplication (AMM) Technique. This efficiently will reduce the number of clock cycles for implementation.

Due to limited monitoring capacity, the traditional electricity grids cannot forecast the exact demand side so that supply side of grid can be scaled accordingly. To forecast the customers demand more effectively, traditional grids are getting upgraded into Smart Grids. Smart Grid consists of various elements including Smart Appliances, Smart meters, Access points and Control Centers to form an advance network which can continuously monitor energy profiling information of the customers. Continuous monitoring of customers energy profiling and consumption is possible in the form of secured communication of message exchange between different elements of Smart Grid i.e. between Smart Appliances and Smart meters, smart meters and access points, access points gateways and control centers. Demand forecast prediction is key to Smart Grid, but customer privacy needs to be preserved. In this paper, we attempt to propose a lightweight privacy preservation scheme.

Though data sharing in cloud computing is most common approach used in most communication network because of the different advantages but it also having some difficulties. This scheme involves three general approaches. Treebased Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) based group key agreement, proxy re-encryption and proxy signature. The proposed framework tries to reduce the overhead of uploading as well as downloading of the files in the cloud storage. The proxy signature technique is used which allows the group leader to effectively grant the permission to one or more selected group members. The proxy re-encryption is proposed which substitutes most computationally demanding operations to Cloud storage Servers without disclosing any sensitive information or data.

The most prominent approach for image steganography is the Least Significant Bit Algorithm (LSB). In this the least significant bit of all pixels of an image is used to hide information in them. The flaw of this algorithm is that it becomes very easy for an attacker to extract information from this algorithm. In that context an approach has been developed to help increase the security of the algorithm. For the proposed approach we consider the entire data to form one big block of information. The first step is to encrypt this information. This is done using the famous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The key to encrypt this information is then hidden using the RSA algorithm. This adds an extra layer of security to the algorithm. Next the encrypted block of data is broken down to 'n' blocks, where 'n' is chosen by the user. 'n+1' images are then chosen at random and each block is hidden using LSB with an image. The images are sent in random. However, the sequence is stored in a hash table which is hidden in the extra image. All the 'n+1' images are sent, the first 'n' in a random order. The sequence is extracted using the hash table and then the decryption of key is first then and then the entire data. © 2016 IEEE.",AES; Hashing; LSB; RSA,Data privacy; Data structures; Steganography; Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms; Block-based approaches; Broken down; Extract informations; Hashing; Image steganography; Least significant bits; RSA algorithms; Cryptography,"Gowda, S.N.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IITIndia; email: kini5gowda@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Although some form of security mechanisms like authentication and encryption have been provided on platforms such as Android, these alone cannot mitigate all the forms of threats. Thus, the need for an intrusion detection system for smartphones has become immensely important. In this project, we capitalize on earlier approaches of host-based intrusion detection systems and behavior-based intrusion detection systems for Android smartphones to design and implement a host-based, behavior-based passive intrusion detection system, Protego, for Android smartphones. There are two versions-static and dynamic, each with its own novel approach. The static version of Protego improves predictive performance by implementing feature reduction, thus increasing classifier accuracy significantly. The novelty of dynamic approach is that it analyzes live traffic with a minimum delay (in the order of milliseconds). This opens up a variety of use cases for our system, especially in the business world where information security on smartphones is of utmost importance.

The network delivers the traffic related information to the vehicles commencing the inter-vehicular communication (IVC), considering driver's context awareness and sensitivity. Rather than moving in random fashion as in other ad hoc networks, vehicles move in an organized way. Since all the vehicles on road need to be equipped with message transmission capabilities, the realistic scenario of VANET is often canvassed. Secure routing and smooth operation are even more questionable. This research work aims to enhance security by integrating group signature with Non-transitive Proxy Re-encryption technique. Proxy re-encryption is a cryptographic technique which allows a third party to re-encrypt the message in such a way that it can decrypted by other authorized people as well, along with the person for which the message was originally sent. Non-transitiveness of the algorithm makes sure that proxy is not able to generate re-encryption key, rkA?C given rkA?B and rkB?C. This framework benefits the network in two possible ways: First, the message sent in group can be read by either member of the group or the groups which are allowed to read the message specifically using re-encryption technique. Second, even if the proxy is compromised, C cannot decrypt A's message if the re-encryption rights were given only for B. © 2016 IEEE.",Group Signature; Non-transitivity; Proxy re-encryption; VANET,Ad hoc networks; Network security; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Cryptographic techniques; Group signature scheme; Group signatures; Inter-vehicular communication; Message transmissions; Non-transitivity; Proxy re encryptions; VANET; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

Several Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) schemes have emerged in this perspective and served the purpose. Most of the attribute based encryption schemes use bilinear pairing approach for computation. High computational complexity in bilinear pairing implementation is making the algorithm insufficient. In order to cope up with these complexity issues, point halving technique with Multi-Base Number Representation (MBNR) is recommended for efficient computation of field operations.

The Watermarking technique which is based on signature embedding strategy and signature hosting strategy is analysed. The signature embedding strategy introduces a digital signature in unused positions of memory structures included in digital designs, thus, the area of the system is not increased. The signature hosting strategy takes advantage of memory structures or combinational logic included in the design to host signature bit blocks, which makes it difficult to change or to remove the signature without damaging the design. The digital signature is obtained using cryptographic hash function, thus allowing the prevention of forging attacks. Both these strategies are compared and evaluated for tradeoff between signature strength and complexity in signature extraction. © 2016 IEEE.",(SES) Signature Extraction Sequence; (SHA) Secure Hash Algorithm; Hash value; Intellectual Property; Signature location,Authentication; Extraction; Hash functions; Intellectual property; Watermarking; Cryptographic hash functions; Embedding strategies; Fingerprinting techniques; Hash value; Intellectual property protection; Secure hash algorithm; Signature extraction; Watermarking algorithms; Cryptography,"Leitao, F.; Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Dept., Don Bosco College of EngineeringIndia; email: flavia_leitao@yahoo.com",Niranjan S.K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This text is taken and first encrypted using the Data Encryption Standard Algorithm (DES) with the help of a key. This key to encrypt the data is then encrypted using the RSA algorithm. This encrypted text is then hidden in an image using the standard LSB algorithm and then the image is sent. To decrypt the data, first the key has to be decrypted using RSA algorithm.

Cryptography has emerged as a significant solution which portrays a vivacious role in securing the information against several attacks. Advanced Encryption Standard block cipher (Known as AES) is an extensively studied and widely used cryptographic block cipher system to secure data and information. The strength of AES algorithm is determined by the choice of S-Box along with other aspects. This paper proposes a new technique to generate S-Box dynamically which will intensify the complexity of S-Box construction to encounter any possible attack on the fixed S-Box. Predefined static S-Boxes pose a weak point for the attackers to analyze certain cipher text pairs. The new S-boxes created are additionally dynamic, random and key dependent which attempts to escalate the complexity of the algorithm and furthermore mark the cryptanalysis more challenging.

At present this is more mature application in the field of quantum computing. The fundamental concept of this protocol involves two parties, wishing to exchange a key both with access to a classical public communication channel and a quantum communication channel. The entanglement distillation approach of BB84 is widely used because the act of reading a quantum bit (QuBits) changes the bit, it is difficulty for hackers to interfere without being detected sufficient number of bits. But this technique uses only four directions of electron movements so it is possible to guess the key. To overcome these drawbacks here two level QRNA technique is proposed for security.

Hence there is continuous research towards finding a suitable approach to ensure high security for the information. In recent decades, cryptography is being used extensively for providing security on the Internet although primarily used in the military and diplomatic communities. One such approach is the application of Chaos theory in cryptosystems. In this work, we have proposed the usage of combined multiple recursive generator (CMRG) for KEY generation based on a chaotic function to generate different multiple keys. It is seen that negligible difference in parameters of chaotic function generates completely different keys as well as cipher text.

Rapid development of this technology has led to the usage of various embedded devices in our daily life. However, for resource sharing and communication among these devices, there is a requirement for connecting these embedded devices to a large pool of resources like a cloud. The promising applications of IoT in Government and commercial sectors are possible by integrating cloud servers with these embedded devices. But such an integration of technologies involves security issues like data privacy and authentication of devices whenever information is exchanged between them. Recently, Kalra and Sood proposed an authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for IoT and cloud servers and claimed that their scheme satisfies all security requirements and is immune to various types of attacks. However, in this paper, we show that Kalra and Sood scheme is susceptible to offline password guessing and insider attacks and it does not achieve device anonymity, session key agreement, and mutual authentication. Keeping in view of the shortcomings of Kalra and Sood’s scheme, we have proposed an authentication scheme based on ECC for IoT and cloud servers.

It is not only the idea of being able to access our data easily from anywhere around the world that makes it so attractive but also its availability at considerably low prices. Due to high demand of cloud services, the development of this type of computing is inevitable. In such a scenario, it is the security of the data stored over such an open environment which is the subject of concern in the world of computing. Even though its development is highly in demand, security issues pose issues of concern every now and then for the users as well as the cloud service providers.

Captcha are available in various forms such as image based, puzzle based, audio based and video based Captcha. Every Captcha is prone to attacks such as robots-in-the-middle attack and humans hired to solve the Captcha. Websites which needs little or no authentication requires less security while other websites which needs user authentication due to confidential information, requires secure access. Depending on the security requirements, different forms of Captcha are required. In this paper, we propose a novel Captcha scheme which addresses the issues faced by existing Captcha schemes. The proposed scheme is like a game so it will be more entertaining for humans to solve. AJigJax Captcha requires no or small database on server. The proposed scheme includes all essential features such as memorability, usability and security against human bombs. The performance analysis of proposed AJigJax Captcha, based on drag and drop functionality, shows that 75% of respondents supported AJigJax Captcha and believes that it must be implemented in real life scenario. 87.5% of respondents prefer using mouse rather than keyboard to solve the Captcha and 92.5% of respondents were successfully able to solve all the rounds of the proposed Captcha scheme. © 2016 IEEE.",AJAX; Captcha; CaRP; CL1 (Captcha Level 1); CL2 (Captcha Level 2); DDIM; DnD; JSP; OCR; RITM,Authentication; Cryptography; Optical character recognition; Websites; AJAX; CAPTCHAs; CaRP; DDIM; Level 2; Level-1; RITM; Electronic mail filters,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

However, security is an important concern due to prevalent illegal access to data in wireless networks. Hence, in this paper, compressive sensing (CS) and finite field wavelet packet-division multiplexing (FFWPDM) transmultiplexer based approach is proposed for secure transmission of multiple images. Further, to reconstruct the image, we utilize the compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm, namely orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) at the receiver. The most complex part of the OMP algorithm is to solve the least square problem. Thus, in this work, we implement the LS solution using Q-R decomposition (QRD) to reduce the complexity. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated with implementation results. © 2016 IEEE.",Compressive sensing; encryption; FFWPDM; multiple image transmission; trans-multiplexer; WPDM,Complex networks; Cryptography; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Packet networks; Signal reconstruction; Compressive sensing; FFWPDM; Finite field wavelets; Least square problems; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Reconstruction algorithms; Transmultiplexers; WPDM; Compressed sensing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Uttar Pradesh Sect.

The lack of wires facilitates to overcome most limitations of traditional wired networks, allowing deployment in hostile environment or mobile scenarios. When nodes do not depend on any pre-existing infrastructure, wireless network is known as wireless ad-hoc network. In this case, communication relies on the ability of the nodes to form a multi-hop radio network. Security is a major concern in every communication system. Every node in network must be authenticated for reliable communication. There are many authentication algorithms like message authentication codes, public key cryptography etc. Most of these mechanisms are either insecure or complex. In this paper we have proposed an algorithm for authentication of sensor nodes in wireless sensor nodes, the proposed algorithm uses key distribution for authentication of nodes. The sensor nodes are logically arranged in form of binary tree with base station forming root node. A key is calculated for each node by its parent based on ID of node and key of parent. Authentication of a node can be done only by its parent. Any authentication request of a node is sent to its parent node and it authenticates the node. The proposed mechanism is simulated in Matlab and its performance is evaluated. It has been found that the proposed mechanism is successfully authenticating the sensor nodes and is simple and secure as well. © 2016 IEEE.",Hashkey; ID; Kparent; Kchild,Ad hoc networks; Binary trees; Cryptography; Mobile telecommunication systems; Public key cryptography; Secure communication; Sensor nodes; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Authentication algorithm; Hashkey; Hostile environments; Message authentication codes; Multi-hop radio networks; Node authentications; Reliable communication; Wireless sensor node; Authentication,,Sheikh R.Mishra D.K.Jain S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In majority of the cryptosystems the crucial arithmetic operation is modular exponentiation. It is composed of a series of modular multiplications. Hence, the performance of any cryptosystem is strongly depends on the efficient implementation of these operations. This paper presents the Bit Forwarding 3-bits(BFW3) technique for efficient implementation of modular exponentiation. The modular multiplication involved in BFW3 is evaluated with the help of Montgomery method. These techniques improves the performance by reducing the frequency of modular multiplications. Results shows that the BFW3 technique is able to reduce the frequency of multiplications by 18.20% for 1024-bit exponent.

In AVK, after establishment of the secret key (through some IKE protocols, like IKEv2 or 2 PAKA or 3 PAKA, etc), the successive keys are generated that are variable in nature from session to session by using time variant key technique. In this work, it is shown that how AVK can provide higher security than fixed key from well-known plaintext attack (for example, brute force attack) and ciphertext only attack (for example, frequency attack etc) due to randomness of keys. In order to improve the level of randomness among the key set, a new method is proposed to generate keys where the randomness are achieved not only in terms of change in bits sequence but also flexible in size as well. Randomness of the key set is also compared with other related time variant key mechanisms to prove superiority. © 2016, The Institution of Engineers (India).",AVK; Security; Size-variant key; Time-variant key,Cryptography; Brute-force attack; Ciphertext-only attacks; Insecure communication channel; Known-plaintext attacks; Perfect securities; Security; Size-variant key; Time variant; Random processes,"Banerjee, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: subhasishism@gmail.com",,Springer India,22502106,,,,English,J.

Methods: To achieve the objective the authors have used the AES algorithm to encrypt the file stored after de-duplication in the cloud. De-duplication is done based on comparison of contents, file type and size. For an authorized user to access the file from the cloud, generation of OTP using SSL protocol is adopted. Findings: Files uploaded in the cloud are encrypted using traditional encryption algorithms which don't provide high levels of security. Files can be accessed by anyone who is authorized. Privileges are not considered. During de-duplication, only the name and size of the files are considered. Application: Files within the public cloud can't be viewed by everyone who has registered with the cloud. Those who have the respective privileges can only view the file. Proof of Ownership is assured. Since de-duplication is done based on the content redundancy within the cloud storage is avoided. Usage of OTP ensures that the content is viewed by the individuals who have the respective privileges related to the file.

The cover image is encrypted; the information to be secured is scrambled, and then embedded in the Intermediate Significant Bit (ISB) planes of encrypted cover image, at the locations determined by a Pseudorandom Address Vector (PAV). The pseudorandom embedding of the scrambled data in the ISB planes of encrypted image results in a three tier security of the data to be secured. The ISBPE embedding results in an important advantage that the proposed scheme becomes completely robust to commonly employed attack of Least Significant Bit (LSB) removal/replacement. A novel concept of embedding a very small size fragile watermark in addition to the secret information has been used which facilitates early tamper detection. This feature could save crucial processor time in critical situations of national security issues/warfare etc. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more robust to various signal processing attacks like Joint Picture Expert Group compression, Additive White Gaussian Noise and ‘salt and pepper’ noise as compared to conventional LSB based embedding techniques.

Image Steganography is one of the most reliable technique in encryption and decryption of an image (hidden) inside other image (cover) such way that only cover image is visible. In this paper frequency domain Image Steganography using DWT and Modified LSB technique is proposed. The proposed approach uses DWT to convert spatial domain information to frequency domain information. The LL band is used for further Image Steganographic process. The image is decoded using inverse LSB. Since the LL band is used for encoding and decoding purpose, memory requirement of the design is less for hardware implementation. Also this will increase the operating frequency of the architecture.

Even though cloud providers use different authentication policies, the sensitive data is still prone to attacks. In order to provide confidentiality, integrity and privacy, cloud users employ encryption schemes, there are various encryption technique used. Each of these encryption techniques has its own hindrance such as AES is a time consuming encryption algorithm. Hence, whichever encryption used, should satisfy data confidentiality and integrity. Homomorphic encryption is a reliable encryption technique which ensures data confidentiality and integrity. I propose a novel encryption and decryption technique which satisfies data confidentiality and integrity. This paper uses Homomorphic encryption and Location-based decryption as two different techniques to provide data security in cloud storage. The encryption process is based on Homomorphic encryption and decryption is based on user location. The location-based decryption enhances the data security in this framework.

As these foundries may not always be trusted, it results in security vulnerabilities and threats such as counterfeiting, IP piracy, reverse engineering, overbuilding and Hardware Trojans. Logic encryption has emerged to be a potential solution to secure the design against these threats. It introduces some extra hardware (key-gates) into the design to hide the functionality from unauthorized users, using secret keys. The locations of insertion of key-gates determine the quality of the security provided by the resulting design.

The proposed generator is applied with an aim to secure the digital images by framing an image encryption process based on the effective TRBG. The statistical analyses conform to the required encryption standards and quality. But, Volos et al image encryption scheme inherently holds a number of vulnerabilities that make it possible to break the encryption scheme. This paper proposes the break of the Volos et al image encryption scheme by exploiting these vulnerabilities to evidence that their scheme lacks security. It is practically shown by applying the chosen-plaintext and known-plaintext attacks which successfully recovers the plaintext-image from the encrypted image without knowing the secret key. The idea is to show the ineligibility of the encryption scheme for use in practical image security applications. © 2016 IEEE.",Cryptanalysis; Double scroll chaotic systems; Image encryption; Security; Synchronization; True random bit generator,Aluminum; Chaotic systems; Image processing; Number theory; Security of data; Signal processing; Synchronization; Chaotic synchronization; Cryptanalysis; Encryption standards; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Known-plaintext attacks; Security; True randoms; Cryptography,,Goel S.Sanghi D.Zomaya A.Y.Ghosh R.K.Boukerche A.Saxena V.Gaur M.Banerjee R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

We show that the first construction is secure against Chosen Plaintext Attacks (CPAs) while the second scheme is secure against Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs), without introducing any random oracle heuristic. Both the schemes enjoy constant-size ciphertext, constant number of pairing operations, and constant computation cost during encryption and decryption. We further propose two non-monotone access structure variants, one is CPA secure and another is CCA secure, preserving the same functionality as that of MAS primitives. We thereafter present a large attribute universe KP-ABE for MAS, still utilizing low computation cost together with constant number of pairing operations and public parameters. Unlike the existing approaches, this does not impose a bound on the size of attribute sets used in encryption, however, the security is in random oracle model. Our final result is a dual-policy ABE supporting LSSS-realizable MAS with significantly low communication and computation cost. Furthermore, we extend our KP-ABE to efficient key-policy attribute-based broadcast encryption. While the secret key in all our constructions has quadratic-size in the number of attributes, the number of pairing evaluations is constant.

An approach based on traditional matrix representation has been proposed to design a Word oriented FCSR (WFCSR) automaton in [2], [3]. This automaton always generates a fixed ?-sequence, which is not desired for some cryptographic applications. In this paper, we present a new WFCSR automaton which enhances the traditional matrix representation by incorporating ?-mask and/or ?-mask operations on certain blocks (or words) of WFCSR automaton. By applying different ?-mask and/or ?-mask on certain blocks (or words) of WFCSR automaton, we can generate multiple ?-sequences without changing its structure. We can use the proposed approach to design WFCSR automaton in Fibonacci, Galois and Ring representations.

Hence, anonymity becomes one of the important aspects in MANET. In last few years, a lot of research has been carried out by different researcher to prevent the anonymity of the MANET. Different routing protocols have been evolved such as ANODR, GSPR, AO2P, ALARM and ASR to secure the anonymity of the MANET. But all of these protocols have some limitations regarding providing complete anonymity of source, destination and also routes and also involving high cost due to hop by hop encryption and redundant traffic. To overcome above issues ALERT protocol is evolved which is distinguished by its low cost due to randomized routing mechanism and anonymity protection for sources, destinations, and routes. But ALERT protocol does not have any strategy to provide security against the active attacks such as MITM and DoS attack. So in the proposed work we have designed new strategy which uses hashing with SHA-1 algorithm and location based pseudonyms of nodes technique to avoid the attacks. The simulation of the existing and proposed ALERT protocol has been carried out with JAVA using JUNG tools and shown that our proposed solution is able to avoid the attacks on the network. Also it is efficient in terms of energy consumption and packet delivery ratio as compared to existing ALERT protocol. © 2016 IEEE.",ALERT; Anonymity; DoS attack; MITM attack; Mobile ad hoc networks,Automation; Computer crime; Computer software; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Emergency services; Energy utilization; Military applications; Mobile commerce; Mobile security; Power management (telecommunication); Process control; ALERT; Anonymity; Hop-by-hop encryptions; MITM attack; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Packet delivery ratio; Randomized routing; Redundant traffic; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The signature area of the document contains a particular dot pattern which helps the digital pen track the movements as the signature is created. While the paper is being signed, the digital pen also records the user's fingerprint for later verification. The obtained information is then converted to binary bits and is encoded using DNA encryption. This cipher data is transmitted to the secondary user (receiver) where the cipher is decoded and printed on the second copy of the document.

Randomiser is placed to scramble bits after cipher text and remove sequence of consecutive three 0's and 1's to enhance performance security. The basic model of randomiser is based on XOR operation and shifting of data. Randomiser remove the long sequences, it change one bit into another bit.

So, when such algorithms are used to encrypt long messages, an attacker may easily find out and note down the common 2-letter or 3-letter words used and with the help of those letters and some brute force he will be able to decrypt the entire message. To overcome this crisis or this drawback we have come up with a solution SET REPLACEMENTS technique. Set Replacements technique is a substitution algorithm which allows you to have a different cipher text for every instance of the same letter i.e. every time you use a letter which is repeated twice or thrice in the word, it will have a different cipher text replacing it on its every instance. This will ensure that the attacker will not be able to note down the repeatedly used words or common words and decrypt the entire message using those key words and some brute force, thus securing the confidentiality of the message to its roots. © 2016 IEEE.",Cipher text; Set replacements technique; Shadow set,Automation; Cryptography; Process control; Brute force; Ciphertexts; Key words; Secret code; Set replacements technique; Shadow set; Solution set; Optimization,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

The universal use of internet for communication has increased the attacks to users. The security of information is the present issue related to privacy and safety during storage and communication. Cryptography and Steganography are two popular ways of sending essential information in a confidential way. Cryptography is the method of converting plain text into cipher text but in Steganography messages are converted into an encrypted format using a key and then this cipher text is hidden into an image, audio or video file as per user's choice. The information-hiding process in a steganographic system starts by identifying a cover medium's redundant bits (those that can be modified without destroying that medium's integrity). The embedding process starts with creating a stego medium by replacing these redundant bits with data from the hidden message. In this paper, we present a novel approach to resolve the remained problems such as robustness and capacity of image and video Steganography. In the proposed algorithm, message bits are clustered and grouped together using K-Means clustering and then the clustered message is embedded inside the cover medium by using direct mapping which result increase the robustness and capacity of the cover medium. The robustness specially would be increased against those intended attacks which try to reveal the hidden message and also some unintended attacks like noise addition as well. © 2016 IEEE.",Formatting; Insert; Style; Styling,Automation; Cryptography; Digital communication systems; Digital storage; Mapping; Process control; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Video signal processing; Digital communications; Formatting; Information hiding; Insert; Steganographic system; Style; Styling; Video steganography; Steganography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

This form of cryptosystem is based on elliptic curves over some Galois fields. Elliptic Curve Cryptography or Cryptosystem (ECC) is a public-key cryptosystem that makes use of public and private key pairs as a means of encrypting and decrypting information in the internet. The critical security of ECC relies on the ability to compute multiplication of a point by an integer easily and the unfeasibility or failure to find out the multiplier and multiplicand given product point within a time window. The size of the elliptic curve determines the security of the system. The main advantage and benefit of using ECC compared to other cryptosystems is that we can use smaller keys without compromising the security of the system.

Coverage and clustering techniques enable the sensor network to operate in group-based and region-based communication and thus save the node energy. Energy-efficient protocols save the node energy and increase the network life cycle in a resource-constrained sensor network. Cluster head (CH) node manages and controls the operations such as network topology, coverage area, and routing paths (multi-paths and fault-tolerant paths) of the network. In this paper, we present deterministic K-means secure coverage clustering (K-SCC) with periodic authentication. The proposed protocol uses coverage clustering technique with periodic authentication between the CH node and sensor nodes to establish the secure channel in the network. Maximum cover of K nodes is maintained in the secure coverage cluster to achieve authenticated communication between the sensor nodes in the network. The proposed K-SCC protocol is compared with the existing protocols such as deterministic-SCC and random-SCC protocols. Simulation results indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol achieves an average of 84% coverage ratio (cluster/sensor node ratio) as compared with 62% coverage ratio in the existing SCC protocols. Simulations also indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol consumes 20% less energy as compared with the existing SCC protocol. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The storage of personal information on cloud servers may result in the exposure of confidential information to unauthorized individuals or organizations. Several solutions employing attribute-based encryption schemes have been proposed for secure sharing of data using cloud servers. However, most of the solutions fail to trace the traitors, who intentionally leaked their data access privileges for personal gain. This paper introduces a traceable ciphertext policy attribute-based signcryption (sign-then-encrypt) scheme to simultaneously realize the notion of traitor-tracing, fine-grained access control, sender anonymity, message integrity, authenticity and sensitivity by extending traceable attribute based encryption scheme using attribute-based signature. Single authority may compromise user's key. Hence to reduce the trust on authority, our proposed scheme employs different authorities for key generation and traitor-tracing. In addition, our proposed scheme preserves message sensitivity by allowing the data-owner to define message category label.

In FE, it is possible to derive restricted decryption keys, also called functional keys, corresponding to specific functions from a master secret key. Such a functional key allows the evaluation of its associated functionality on encrypted data-items, but does not help to extract any additional information about the encrypted data. While confidentiality of the encrypted data is the prime security concern in FE, various scenarios of computation delegation, especially when the delegated functionalities themselves involve sensitive informations, privacy must also be ensured for the functions embedded within the issued functional keys. This paper presents a non-generic and simple private key FE scheme for the inner product functionality, also known as inner product encryption (IPE). In contrast to other similar constructions, our IPE scheme achieves the strongest indistinguishability-based notion of combined data and function privacy in the private key setting, termed as the full-hiding security, in the standard model without employing any heavy-duty cryptographic tool or non-standard complexity assumption.

Even though several authentication schemes which are based on password, hash function and other cryptographic primitives are existing, studies showing that it is vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. This paper proposes an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based Self-Certified Key Management (SCKM) scheme for mutual authentication scheme relying on self-certified public key management of IoT systems. In this scheme, the public key of the more resource constrained nodes in the IoT system is generated by the less constrained systems. The private key of the more constrained nodes is generated jointly by the nodes. This concept satisfies the zero knowledge Proof. A security analysis shows that of proposed scheme is effective in defending against various attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",Internet of Things; public key cryptography; self-certified public key; session key; zero knowledge proof,Authentication; Cryptography; Hash functions; Public key cryptography; Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC); Internet of Things (IOT); Machine-to-machine technologies; Resource constrained nodes; Security and privacy issues; Selfcertified public key; Session key; Zero knowledge proof; Internet of things,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

With the number of cloud applications is increasing, the data security becomes an major concern in the cloud. The open source software Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is used to build cloud storage system which will allow to store large data with high throughput and fault tolerance. Originally the Hadoop system was designed without any security model, so security is the major weakness of Hadoop in its development. As far as storage of sensitive data is concerned in the Hadoop, data security will be an important issue. With the increase in the acceptance of Hadoop, there is also raising trend in incorporating more and more security features in enterprises. Also demand of encryption of the data is increased to secure the confidential data and to prevent privacy rule violation. Over the period of recent years efforts have been made in order to obtain some level of security in Hadoop such as Kerberos and Transparent Data Encryption(TDE) for Hadoop.

In this the encryption algorithm is bit by bit XOR operations of plain text bit and corresponding key sequence bit respectively. This concept further generalized to a non binary cipher system defined over any finite field GF (p), where p is prime integer. Again generalizing further it can also be defined a stream cipher system over a ring Zm, arithmetic operations are carried out over modulo m, where m is suitable large composite integers. In our work, non binary word oriented key sequence is generated for the cryptographic application. Since word oriented key sequence is generated, the larger word can be split into smaller word and these can be processed in parallel. The level of randomness properties of generated key sequences is discussed by conducting statistical tests. The effectiveness of the non binary word oriented stream cipher system is based mainly on encryption / decryption algorithm, key generation and its parameters. This paper concentrates on generating non binary word oriented key sequence of maximum period. This generated key is used for in stream cipher system applied for image data. The properties like, uniformity, independence and maximum length for the word oriented non binary key sequence is tested and verified.

Because of intrinsic features of images (i.e. bulk data capacity, high redundancy etc) encryption of images is different from that of texts and it is generally difficult to handle by traditional methods. Present study proposes a novel symmetric image encryption algorithm using pixel shuffling and reversed binary string of pixel intensity value. Here, the size of the proposed Key-row and Keycol vectors are same as the no of rows and no of columns of the original image. For each pixel, initially binary pattern of pixel intensity value is reversed. In the next step, the new intensity value is stored at a shuffled position. The pixel position is shuffled using two key vectors-Key-row and Keycol. The proposed method is applied on benchmark images and assessment of performance is done using different standard metric for key testing-histogram, correlation, entropy, NPCR and UACI between the original and encrypted image. Theoretical analysis and experimental results both confirm that proposed algorithm possesses high security and can resist statistical and differential attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",Correlation analysis; Entropy analysis; Histogram analysis; NPCR; Statistical attack; Symmetric Key; Transposition cipher; UACI,Benchmarking; Cryptography; Entropy; Graphic methods; Pixels; Correlation analysis; Entropy analysis; Histogram analysis; NPCR; Statistical attacks; Symmetric keys; Transposition cipher; UACI; Image processing,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is one such technology that is improving the quality of health care. WBAN has personal patient data. Attackers can access this data from Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) or from the wireless channel between nodes and server; this requires efficient security protocol for providing data security. In case of emergency, the vital parameters should be easily accessed by the doctor's or the paramedic. Stringent authentication and security criteria's makes it difficult to access the data during emergency, which may prove to be disastrous for the patient. This paper proposes a new approach for data security in wireless channel specifically during emergency conditions. WBAN uses Advanced Encryption Standard-128 (AES-128) cipher which requires substantial time for encryption which may be fatal in case of emergencies. Security mechanism for sensor nodes should be lightweight due to the area and resource constraints.

The chances of attacks and image analysis by malicious people are more on images with noise-like or texture-like contents. This paper presents an efficient visually meaningful image encryption algorithm that uses integer discrete wavelet transform(DWT) and Arnold transform.

The distinctive nature of the proposed technique is gathering the data, aggregating and then slicing the aggregate using t-out-of-n secret sharing scheme (based on CRT) and then route the packets to the sink via multiple paths. The sink will recover the final aggregate with just t shares using CRT. The multi-objective of the proposed technique is to provide data privacy, identity privacy, source location privacy, and route privacy. The solution also mitigates the problem of packet losses associated with the unreliable wireless communication medium by improving the reliability. We also propose an enhanced privacy preserving routing technique that achieves network wide routing paths, and overcomes the drawback of existing phantom single-path routing (PSPR) and forward random walk-based routing (FRW) schemes. Finally, we present the details of the proposed technique with a numerical example and give its possible application for secret and dynamic routing in WSNs.

For identity authentication purposes, multiple watermarks are embedded into the same medical image / multimedia objects simultaneously, which provides extra level of security with acceptable performance in terms of robustness and imperceptibility. In the embedding process, the cover image is decomposed into first level discrete wavelet transforms where the A (approximation/lower frequency sub-band) is transformed by DCT and SVD. The watermark image is also transformed by DWT, DCT and SVD. The S vector of watermark information is embedded in the S component of the cover image. The watermarked image is generated by inverse SVD on modified S vector and original U, V vectors followed by inverse DCT and inverse DWT. The watermark is extracted using an extraction algorithm. Furthermore, the text watermark is embedding at the second level of the D (diagonal sub-band) of the cover image. The security of the text watermark considered as EPR (Electronic Patient Record) data is enhanced by using encryption method before embedding into the cover. The results are obtained by varying the gain factor, size of the text watermark, and cover medical images.

Progressive Visual Secret Sharing (PVSS) also allows the decryption of secret image by stacking of physical transparencies but clarity and contrast of the decoded secret image will be increased progressively with the number of stacked shares. Most of the existing researches on PVSS suffer with the common problems like space-inefficiency(pixel expansion) and noise-like shares.

Reducing the frequency of modular multiplications and the time requirements for modular multiplication will help in developing efficient modular exponential algorithms. This work proposes an energy efficient modular exponential algorithm based on bit forwarding techniques. In particular, two algorithms, Bit Forwarding 1-bit (BFW1) and Bit Forwarding 2-bits (BFW2), which are modifications of the existing binary exponential algorithm, have been developed. Hardware realizations of the proposed algorithms have been evaluated in terms of throughput, power and energy. Results show increased throughput of the order of 11.02% and 15.13%, reduction in power to 1.93% and 6.35% and energy saving of the order of 1.9% and 6.35% for BFW1 and BFW2 algorithms respectively.

In this paper, initially, DSA optimized classical PI/PIDF controller is implemented to an identical two-area thermal-thermal power system and then the study is extended to two more realistic power systems which are widely used in the literature. To assess the usefulness of DSA, three enhanced competitive algorithms namely comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), ensemble of mutation and crossover strategies and parameters in differential evolution (EPSDE), and success history based DE (SHADE) are studied in this paper. Moreover, the superiority of proposed DSA optimized PI/PID/PIDF controller is validated by an extensive comparative analysis with some recently published meta-heuristic algorithms such as firefly algorithm (FA), bacteria foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA), genetic algorithm (GA), craziness based particle swarm optimization (CRPSO), differential evolution (DE), teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA). A case of robustness and sensitivity analysis has been performed for the concerned test system under parametric uncertainty and random load perturbation. Furthermore, to demonstrate the efficacy of proposed DSA, the system nonlinearities like reheater of the steam turbine and governor dead band are included in the system modeling.

The primary point of contention with these mechanisms remains either memorizing or securely storing the user’s credentials. The proposed work addresses this critical issue by presenting a fingerprint biometric-based mechanism to protect users’ digitized documents. In our approach, biometric features are extracted from the user’s fingerprint captured with a fingerprint biometric sensor. The extracted features are then used to generate a unique code utilizing the convolution coding principle. This unique code is further used to generate a cryptographic key for encryption and decryption of the user’s document. A sedulous investigation to our approach which includes experimentation with a variety of standard fingerprint images as the database starkly reveals a staggering 95.12 % true positive and 0 % as false negative.

BORON is a substitution and permutation based network, which operates on a 64-bit plain text and supports a key length of 128/80 bits. BORON has a compact structure which requires 1939 gate equivalents (GEs) for a 128-bit key and 1626 GEs for an 80-bit key. The BORON cipher includes shift operators, round permutation layers, and XOR operations. Its unique design helps generate a large number of active S-boxes in fewer rounds, which thwarts the linear and differential attacks on the cipher. BORON shows good performance on both hardware and software platforms. BORON consumes less power as compared to the lightweight cipher LED and it has a higher throughput as compared to other existing SP network ciphers.

Their natural characteristics make them vulnerable to passive and active attacks, in which misbehaving nodes can eavesdrop or delete packets, modify packet contents. The Identity-based cryptography system to MANET mainly concentrates on deal out the responsibility of consistent ability among the multiple nodes in a network. Cryptographic technique which uses public key is the mechanism considered in this regard. Secret sharing mechanism is adopted by many existing systems which involves secret sharing of keys to a trusted node among nodes in a network which increases security level. Here we propose threshold cryptography which makes the authority more robust against network disasters and harder to negotiation. Identity-based cryptography, where any identity may assist as a public key, makes certificates and certificate distribution superfluous. The authority distributing private keys corresponding to identities is called a Private Key Generator (PKG). The proposed method deliberates distributing a PKG towards the nodes in the MANET. It shows the security properties of the base IBC systems are preserved when this distributed PKG is used instead of the original. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",Cryptography; Key generation; MANET; Private key generation (PKG); Public key,,,,Asian Research Publishing Network,19928645,,,,English,J.

Recently, in 2015, Tsai and Lo proposed a privacy-aware authentication scheme for distributed mobile cloud computing services. In this paper, we first analyze the Tsai–Lo's scheme and show that their scheme is vulnerable to server impersonation attack, and thus, their scheme fails to achieve the secure mutual authentication. In addition, we also show that Tsai–Lo's scheme does not provide the session-key security (SK-security) and strong user credentials’ privacy when ephemeral secret is unexpectedly revealed to the adversary. In order to withstand these security pitfalls found in Tsai–Lo's scheme, we propose a provably secure authentication scheme for distributed mobile cloud computing services. Through the rigorous security analysis, we show that our scheme achieves SK-security and strong credentials’ privacy and prevents all well-known attacks including the impersonation attack and ephemeral secrets leakage attack. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme for the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool, and show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. More security functionalities along with reduced computational costs for the mobile users make our scheme more appropriate for the practical applications as compared to Tsai–Lo's scheme and other related schemes. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of the scheme, we evaluate the proposed scheme using the broadly-accepted NS-2 network simulator. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",AVISPA; Cloud computing; Mutual authentication; NS2 simulation; SK-security; User untraceability,Authentication; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Internet protocols; Network security; Security systems; AVISPA; Mutual authentication; NS-2 simulations; SK-security; Un traceabilitys; Mobile cloud computing,"Das, A.K.; Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: iitkgp.akdas@gmail.com",,Elsevier,0167739X,,FGCSE,,English,Future Gener Comput Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989186782

However, it is an arduous issue to design a secure handover scheme for wireless network because mobile nodes are limited in power and computational capability, handover latency is severely restricted and wireless network is opening and insecure. To deal the issue, we propose an improved privacy-aware handover authentication scheme for wireless network. We give the security proof to demonstrate our proposed scheme can provide mutual authentication and secure key agreement, and can resist all kinds of known security attacks. Compared with up-to-date similar handover schemes, our proposed scheme not only meets the security requirements of handover scheme, but also decreases computation cost and communication cost. Therefore, our proposed scheme is more suitable for wireless network than the similar schemes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Anonymity; Authentication scheme; Handover; ID-based authentication,Authentication; Cryptography; Mobile devices; Wireless networks; Anonymity; Authentication scheme; Computational capability; Handover; Handover authentications; Id-based authentications; Mutual authentication; Security requirements; Network security,"Shen, J.; School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and TechnologyChina; email: jianshen_nuist@sina.com",,Springer New York LLC,9296212,,WPCOF,,English,Wireless Pers Commun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968584133

Although various approaches towards security are proposed day-by-day, the security loop holes are also propagating and thus constant innovation is essential towards protection of data. The paper aims to introduce a selective encryption algorithm for text data encryption termed as Selective Significant Data Encryption (SSDE) adding a noteworthy uncertainty to data while encryption. The SSDE provides sufficient uncertainty to the data encryption process as it selects only significant data out of the whole message using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This in turn reduces the encryption time and enhances the performance. Symmetric key algorithms are typically efficient and fast cryptosystem over other methods, So BLOWFISH method is used for encryption.

Intrusion throws a serious risk in the network. Even though many hardening systems are developed against intrusions, conventional approaches like firewalls, virtual private networks, and encryption techniques are not enough to provide network security. Intrusion detection is a cyber security mechanism that plays an important role in securing the network. Detection rate and false alarm rate are the challenging issues to design an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Various data mining techniques are used to implement network intrusion detection. Classification is a supervised learning which predicts the class label in the data set. Single classifier fails to obtain high accuracy. Base classifiers are not capable of detecting the attacks accurately. Ensemble classifier is a combination of base classifiers. Ensemble classifier outperforms base classifiers. In this paper, we propose a cluster - based ensemble classifier for IDS. K means clustering is used in the experiment. Ensemble classifier is built using ADTree and KNN. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble classifier outperforms other classifiers with 99.8% accuracy. © 2017 ACM.",Clustering; Data mining; Ensemble classifier; Intrusion detection; Network security,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Cryptography; Data mining; Education; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Clustering; Conventional approach; Ensemble classification; Ensemble classifiers; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusion detection; Network-based services; Sensitive informations; Network security,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

This framework allows authorized data distribution among subscribers through publishers. This is an open overlay network. It has some security issues including integrity and confidentiality, authorization, validation etc. Also there is another problem regarding this network, such as Events secrecy and subscriptions clashes with content based routing. Such security issues are very difficult to predict and resolve. To increase the confirrnation and secrecy of broker, this paper introduced the concept of broker less content based publish/subscribe system and also developed a novel technique to improve the same. In this proposed system, subscribers are allowed to view and publish the information if and only if publishers want to share their information. Additionally, to make secure information sharing, only data in encrypted format are shared among subscriber and publishers. For this purpose a more secure encryption algorithm i.e. ECC algorithm is used. Therefore this proposed system is more secure and safe. As ECC utilizes small key size for encryption and decryption, this system takes less computation time and consumes less memory. Different from existing system wh ich can only publish the articles, this proposed system also support for dynamic news or article update with publishing it. After this, to increase the performance of system, cloud services are used. Because of this the performance of system is improved in terms of efficiency, security, data availability and low cost.

Shares are generated of the QR code and distributed among number of participants and later on using threshold (t, n) secret sharing QR code is reconstructed back. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is accurate as retrieved chemical data and chemical molecule structures from any t shares are same as original ones.

In recent times, coarse grain reconfigurable architectures (CGRA) have become popular for building high throughput applications. In many cases, the regular nature of CGRAs allow the architecture to be clocked at frequencies in excess of 400MHz enabling high throughputs. In this work, we use a model coarse grain reconfigurable fabric to explore the potential of implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This coarse grain reconfigurable array with malleable communication links is used to build a multiprocessor archirecture for the highly compute intensive kernel and also exploits dynamic reconfiguration. The semi-systolic near neighbour communication interconnect can be dynamically reconfigured for each 'epoch' of computation. Different rounds of the application are computed in different tiles for different blocks of plain text.

A good majority of Cloud offer services processing of huge data. Although the resources are not limited in cloud, when the services are been expanded, there arises a high demand for storage space. The idea of data de-duplication gains its importance here by offering less storage space needs and hence saving the disk expenditures. However there do also exists some issues on data security and privacy. A number of methodologies are present for data security in cloud when using deduplication since the common deduplication techniques favors the deduplication algorithm to fetch and read data in each file. When coming into security challenges, the positives of deduplication unfortunately comes with high price. The proposed system assures deduplication in block-level and confidentiality of the data. Under the hood of Hadoop the system uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for storing data.

The Concealed Data Aggregation (CDA) techniques achieve these two together. The cryptographic algorithms based on Privacy Homomorphisin (PH) are the basis of most of the CDA techniques, which allows aggregation on encrypted data. Thus there is no need of performing decryptions in aggregator node for the data aggregation. So CDA techniques save the energy of aggregator node and protect the confidentiality of data throughout the network. Among the CDA techniques, symmetric PH based CDA techniques are more feasible in WSNs containing power constrained sensor nodes due to their small kev size. But still there are inanv areas to address more in it.

It is established that in spite of several proposals, RC4 is not secure enough and a trade-off is always sought between security and network performance for overall provisioning of the secure communication. The main goal of the work presented in this paper is the optimization of security-performance tradeoff. We have proposed three RC4 variants referred to as RC4-M1, RC4-M2 and RC4-M3. Security of the proposed schemes is analyzed in terms of randomness and computational complexity. All the proposed variants qualify the NIST statistical test suite of randomness satisfactorily. The proposed schemes also offer computational complexity in terms of greater number of operations relative to the existing variants. The strength of the proposed schemes has been analyzed against different cryptanalytic attempts and shown the resistance of proposed schemes against attacks. The security-performance tradeoff has been analyzed in terms of run time, CPU cycles consumed, energy cost, and throughput. Encryption time of the proposed schemes—RC4-M1, RC4-M2 and RC4-M3 is 30.1, 10 and 48.7 % less as compared to RC4+ respectively. The results clearly indicate that the computation load of the proposed variants is significantly reduced as compared to the RC4+, concluding that the proposed schemes are computationally efficient.

To circumvent these type of attacks, it is necessary to explore different designs, which dissipate less energy. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate zero energy.

A fragile watermark and Block Checksum (computed for each 4 × 4 block) have been embedded in the cover image for facilitating tamper detection and tamper localization, and hence content authentication at receiver. The EPR, watermark data and checksum data has been embedded using Intermediate Significant Bit Substitution (ISBS) to avoid commonly used LSB removal/replacement attack.

In the one end of the spectrum, there are applications which require highest level of security and they use conventional encryption schemes which are neither bandwidth efficient nor format preserving. Thus limit their application to a large extent. Other end of the spectrum is occupied by selective encryption schemes which are used by most of the commercial applications. These schemes though bandwidth efficient are not secure as these schemes are designed to degrade the video quality but overall content remain intelligible. Thus a scheme which is highly secure yet bandwidth efficient is the need of the hour. In this paper, we propose a new format preserving selective encryption scheme for JPEG and MPEG which is compression friendly as well as highly secure. We choose the quantized DCT coefficients of the I-frame for encryption. The resultant image/video is completely obscure and is suitable for high end security applications. Also there is no reduction in the performance of compression algorithms applied later in the standard JPEG/MPEG pipeline. Experiments show that the encrypted image/video file is almost of the same size as that of un-encrypted version. Thus the scheme is suitable for applications like tele-medicine, on-the-go video conferencing using low bandwidth cellular networks, etc. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",JPEG; MPEG; RC4 stream cipher; Secure video conferencing,Bandwidth; Cryptography; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Video cameras; Video conferencing; Commercial applications; Compression algorithms; JPEG; MPEG; Quantized DCT coefficients; Security application; Selective encryption; Stream Ciphers; Network security,"Meenpal, T.; Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, Telecommunication Department NIT Raipur, India, NIT Raipur, G.E.

The practical deployment of PHR system in cloud computing environments raises privacy and information security issues that should be addressed positively. Recently [Future Generation Computer Systems 52 (2015)], a Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Signcryption (CP-ABSC) scheme (Liu et al. 2015) is proposed with the aim to securing PHR data stored at cloud servers, and it is claimed to provide confidentiality against chosen ciphertext attacks in selective-predicate model. Unfortunately, we show in this paper that the claim is incorrect. Besides, the CP-ABSC scheme Liu et al. (2015) cannot realize the property of public ciphertext verifiability which is an essential requirement of signcryption schemes to reduce unnecessary burden on the decryptor for decrypting invalid ciphertexts. In this paper, we propose a provable secure CP-ABSC scheme for cloud-based PHR sharing system that has ability to provide fine-grained access control, confidentiality, authenticity, signcryptor privacy and public verifiability, simultaneously. Our framework exploits expressive monotone boolean functions as signing and encryption predicates, and realizes security in the standard model. On the positive note, our construction exhibits short ciphertext size and requires less number of pairing computations compared to the existing schemes in the area. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Attribute-based signcryption; Chosen ciphertext attack; Personal health record system; Public verifiability; Short ciphertext; Signcryptor privacy,Access control; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Health; Health care; Network security; Security of data; Chosen ciphertext attack; Personal health record; Public verifiability; Short ciphertext; Signcryption; Cryptography,,,Elsevier B.V.,0167739X,,FGCSE,,English,Future Gener Comput Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988395786

The algorithm searches for the position of a text symbol in randomly generated 3-D matrix and subsequently replaces the symbol. The positions in matrix are shuffled in a retraceable manner depending upon the encryption key. Further, the substituted positions are diffused so that all the cipher text get affected even if a single symbol is changed. The system uses a Logistic map for matrix generation and position shuffling. The algorithm also checks the integrity of cipher text by including its parity in encrypted form. As the system includes substitution, permutation and diffusion, high level of cryptographic complexity is achieved in cipher text. The proposed method is key sensitive output cipher text is random in nature and has avalanche effect. The key length chosen is sufficient to resist a brute force attack.

Many existing schemes on visual cryptography are restricted to consider only binary images as secret which are not appropriate for many important applications. Store-and-Forward telemedicine is one such application where medical images are transmitted from one site to another via electronic medium to analyze the patient’s clinical health status. The main objective of Store-and-Forward telemedicine is to provide remote clinical services via two-way communication between the patient and the healthcare provider using electronic medical image, audio and video means. In this paper, a new XOR based Continuous-tone Multi Secret Sharing scheme suitable for store-and-forward telemedicine is proposed to securely transmit the medical images. It also eliminates basic security constraints of VC like pixel expansion in shares/recovered secret images, random pattern of shares, explicit codebook requirement, lossy recovery of secret and limitation on number of secret and shares. Proposed approach is n out of n multi secret sharing scheme which is able to transmit n secret images simultaneously. All secrets could be revealed only after some computations with all n shares and one master share. Master share has been created with the secret key at encoding phase and it can be regenerated at the time of decoding using same secret key. Here all shares are meaningful in continuous-tone which may provide confidentiality to medical images during transmission. Proposed approach not only preserves all basic characteristics of traditional VC but also increases the capacity of secret image sharing. From the experiments we found that irrespective of visible contents of the shares, the probability of getting back the pixel values of respective original secret images at the receiver end is very high. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",E-health; Meaningful shares; Medical image security; Multi secret sharing; Telehelth; Telemedicine; Unexpanded shares; Visual cryptography,Binary images; Cryptography; Decoding; Pixels; Telemedicine; E health; Meaningful shares; Medical image security; Multi-secret sharing; Telehelth; Unexpanded shares; Visual cryptography; Medical imaging,"Shivani, S.; Thapar UniversityIndia; email: shivendrashivani@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990841996

Here, Cloud Computing comes in the picture, it provides IT industry the much-needed resources on a large scale at low cost and makes their task easy. Organizations can easily outsource their huge amount of data to cloud storage. However, the privacy of data is a big concern. The data privacy can be achieved by encryption techniques, but it increases the difficulty of securely searching data on the cloud because searching in encrypted data is itself a challenging task. Recently many schemes have been proposed but these schemes do not consider the semantic of the query. We proposed a novel method by combining LSI and hierarchical cluster to get the semantic relation between the result and to reduce the search space respectively.

When building wireless sensor networks network there is critical issues are emerged such as preserving energy and load balancing. Lifetime of a sensor network is enhanced by implementing and mitigating energy consumption. Number of various parameters such as number of nodes, strength and range of area as well as connectivity of nodes in the network are responsible for the lifetime of network. Energy of battery is most important things for sensor nodes in wireless sensor network. Efficient energy is major part of in mitigate the overhead as well as limited transmission and aggregating data is also important for the enhancing network lifetime. We proposed a clustering routing protocol CRT2FLACO on the basis of type-2 fuzzy logic as well as ACO for balancing the network load and to enhance the lifetime of WSN. Our proposed protocol determines the three fundamental parts of residual energy, neighbor nodes as well as the distance to base station as inputs of a type-2 Mamdani FLS and after that calculate the possibility of a node upgrading as a candidate cluster head and the cluster head competition radius. Implementation of type-2 fuzzy logic is better way to control the overhead existing in WSN. Load of network is efficiently handled by fuzzy unequal competition radius as well as implementation of multi-hop routing protocol technique for data transmission. Additionally, security of data is determined by utilizing encryption algorithm in transmission of data.

Cloud computing service providers require a system which can handle a large number of requests at a time and is needed to be highly available. Major issue faces in cloud computing is Security and data retrieval. In data security an important problem is to prevent illegal modifications and data loss. But, for this it requires either data replication or on-demand computation of a function over the entire contract out data. Generally system keeps multiple copies of the blocks of data on different nodes by replication. Another issue is retrieval of data, whereas in the cloud computing environment it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in the entire globe. Load on system may increase when there is high demand of a data. In this, the main focus is on the problems of security, replication and availability of data. The proposed system use a fragmentation and sole replication (FASR) concept in the cloud to improve the security and data retrieval time rather than using traditional cryptographic techniques. It fragments the file, place every single fragment in distinct node and perform sole replication that is every fragment is replicated only once, to provide security. Particularly selection of primary node is done through hotbed measure, selection of node and placement of other fragments is done through T-coloring technique, which limits tampering of data. Thereby improve retrieval time for easy accessing of the fragments for reconstruction of original file on user request. In this user can download, update and upload the file again. User can also request for required fragments and can update, upload it to cloud. Another automatic updating technique is proposed which allow uploading of only updated fragment in the cloud node. FASR concept provides security; save time and automatic updating technique reduce the resource utilized. Non-cryptographic nature makes the system even faster. © 2016 IEEE.",Automatic updating technique; node Selection; Sole replication data retrieval time; T-coloring,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Automatic updating; Cloud computing environments; Cloud computing services; Cryptographic techniques; Data retrieval; Node selection; On-demand computations; T-coloring; Search engines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Proc.

PUFs are useful security architectures used for identification, authentication and cryptographic key generation. Many PUF topologies are proposed in the past targeting both ASIC and FPGA. It is nearly impossible to get two PUF circuits with same characteristics for the same design. PUFs make use of random process variation occurring during manufacturing of IC which is uncontrollable. The most versatile PUF is ring oscillator (RO) PUF, in which the frequencies of ring oscillators are compared to produce the PUF response. The conventional approach consumes large number of ring oscillators and requires all RO's to be mutually symmetric.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of them. In an ideal IoT all devices will be connected to a common network interface and will be able to communicate with each other to perform tasks that need a human interaction presently. Security in such an interface is of the highest priority. For encryption of messages between devices, unique key generation is important. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) can be used to generate a unique key for this encryption. This paper presents two designs of PUFs which can generate a new key every time the circuit is run and hence this approach is called 'Multi-Key Generator PUF' (MKG-PUF). Once a key is generated, it cannot be generated again even with the same device. Due to the process variations and environmental effects, the keys generated will be random. Power optimized and speed optimized designs are proposed in this paper. The power optimized design utilizes 30% less power compared to the speed optimized design but generates the keys slowly. The speed optimized design consumes more power but can generate the keys in a fraction of the time needed by the power optimized design. © 2016 IEEE.",Encryption; Internet of Things (IoT); Physical Unclonable Function (PUF); Process variation; Security,Access control; Hardware security; Information systems; Internet of things; Nanoelectronics; Computational power; Human interactions; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Optimized designs; Physical unclonable functions (PUF); Process Variation; Security; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The steganography is the technique used for the purpose of hiding the data into a similar or another form of data to create the covert channel among the internet or intranet links to protect the data from the various kinds of masquerading or snooping attacks. Text, image or audio data can be embedded in the images by using the various spatial domain or transform domain methods. In this, we have worked on the center weighted least significant bit method with hidden object encryption to embed the small images in the medium or large sized images. The proposed method employs the spatial domain embedding method using the RGBR for embedding each 8-bit pixel into the cover image hence consume 2 pixels for hiding each 2-bit pixel.

The brain serves to control and coordinate the mental and physical actions. It has the capacity to store innumerable data. This data includes not only childhood memories but also those related to the present age. Tracking the electrical potentials or impulses, commonly known as brain waves, can be utilized for various purposes ranging from diagnosing diseases to decoding personality traits. This can be done using the technique of Electroencephalography (EEG). The amount of data available is exploding so also the opportunities of data mining thereby mounting privacy risks. The current practice either prevents the reuse of raw EEG signals or disrespects participants' right to privacy by using this data for purposes other than those consented to, by the individual. The aim of this work is to put a stop to such privacy risks by extracting and transferring only those features related to an application. Feature is a specific characteristic measurement of a pattern segment. EEG signal processing pertains mainly to feature extraction. There are different methods for extracting features from EEG signals. In this work, the features related to neurological diseases, namely epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, are extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and those related to Schizophrenia are extracted using Autoregressive (AR) method. For securing the raw data, it is doubly encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and is kept under the control of each user. The proposed system thus ensures the privacy of an individual's EEG signals, and mitigates any risk that may arise if raw data is made available as such to the public. © 2016 IEEE.",Brain waves; Electroencephalography (EEG); Encryption; Feature extraction; Privacy,Biomedical signal processing; Data mining; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurology; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms; Application specific; Autoregressive methods; Brain wave; Characteristic measurements; EEG signal processing; Electrical potential; Neurological disease; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The security of the medical images and its related data is the research area which is to be concentrated in today's era. Security in the medical image can be done by hiding patients related data into another image and transfer it safely to a defined location.

Reversible data hiding is one among the many methods to securely store message into a cover media like image. Drawbacks of this method were overcome with the help of novel approaches like Separable reversible data hiding. Separable reversible data hiding is an improvised method in which there are two key players : The content owner and the data hider. The former encrypts the original image with an encryption key while the later exploits the spatial correlation of the natural image to create an additional space to accommodate data. At the receiver side, receiver having the data-hiding key, can extract the data but not the original image. At the same time, the receiver with the encryption key, can extract the image but not the data. If he has both the data-hiding and the encryption keys, he can extract the data and the original image content. The efficacy of this method can be enhanced if the keys too can be secured. This can be done using an efficient key-exchange algorithm like the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm. Also use of multiple encryption methods would make the system compatible with different applications. The system, in its working environment, would come across various actors with different privileges. In such a situation, having an authentication system would ensure that the data is received at the right hands.

There are many application domains that IoT technology can provide very useful services such as health care, transportation, infrastructure and home. Smart devices have limited efficiency in terms of computing storage and battery power. Due to the limited storage of embedded devices, it is difficult to implement strong authorization techniques. To overcome, this problem in the IoT, we have proposed a novel architecture for building a service using open authentication protocol where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system through the IoT device. Among the various authentication protocols available today, OAuth provides many leading organizations with a simple and secure way to authenticate users and permit them to access their protected data. OAuth provides client applications secure delegated access which is commonly used for Internet users to log in to third party websites using their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts without exposing their password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the user, giving the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. We are proposing a smart fire alarm system that notifies the user about the occurrence of fire in his house. User gets an alert message through his twitter and Gmail account simultaneously. Fire alarm system is built by integrating IoT technology with temperature detecting sensors. In order to use Gmail and twitter our device need to authenticate on behalf of the user. For this we use OAuth protocol for delegated access to applications like Gmail and twitter.

Vehicular cloud (VC) facilitates the customers to share underutilized resources by renting it to other users over the Internet. It aims to improve travelling beyond the boundaries of traditional transport systems. VCC has many advanced applications which will help society with minimum cost of investment and less maintenance. Security and privacy is very important issue for every VCC application. Research proposal highlights a cost effective, hassle free and secure communication between the cloud and moving vehicles. Security of VANET cloud covers the challenges, requirements, threats and authentication mechanisms which are very specific to connected high speed vehicles. The complexity of short range communication and location identities are important aspects in VCC security. We have considered Storage as a Service (SaaS) for our work.

The concept is emphasized in Computer Science curricula, and the IT industry values graduates who can use hashing skillfully. Although several implementation details of hashing are routinely handled by software libraries, it remains the responsibility of the programmer to choose a suitable hash function (a poor hash function can degrade performance). Researchers have designed a number of generic hash functions, but environments for code development do not offer these as off-the-shelf solutions. It is also curious that textbooks and reference books do not point learners to this rich resource. Our paper remedies this deficiency by providing learners with an easy way to compare their own hash function's performance with these alternatives. Our assistive tool is an Eclipse plugin for Java programs, and we have focused only on traditional hash functions (non-cryptographic hash functions that do not preserve distance). However, our approach can be extended easily to other programming languages, development environments and hash function classes. © 2016 IEEE.",Data Structures; Hashing; Non-cryptographic hash functions; Running Time,Computer software; Cryptography; Data handling; Data structures; Java programming language; Code performance; Computer science curricula; Cryptographic hash functions; Data processing applications; Development environment; Hashing; Running time; Software libraries; Hash functions,,Kumar V.KinshukMurthy S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The Modified Rivest Scheme (MRS) is an additive homomorphic scheme which has been of late used in many applications requiring the third party processing of encrypted data. Hence MRS fits in to be the base encryption scheme for secured shared key discovery(SSD) protocol. The SSD protocol allows each node to find the keys shared with communicating node without revealing the unshared keys. The current work brings out the security lapse where the keys are compromised and adversary has access to the keys owned by the legitimate node.

Those who understand it realize its significance and the role that it plays in various domains including finance, e-commerce, browsing the web, wireless security, nuclear researches, etc. Cryptographers have already realized that the conventional public cryptographic schemes based on RSA are bound to fail, keeping in mind the rising demand and usage of mobile devices running on low power, as well as the emergence of newer technology and specialized algorithms that can solve the problem of factoring large primes quickly and effectively. RSA which is based on the problem of factoring large primes is surely doomed because of these reasons. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is hence the need of the hour. Not only is it suitable for mobile devices running on low power, as it can provide an equivalent security at lower key sizes, but also it is equally difficult to break, owing to a better trapdoor function and difficult mathematics, provided that it is implemented correctly with strong parameters. In this paper, we discuss about the application of ECC in an area of Electronic Mail Security, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), showing how it can replace RSA completely in this field. I have also discussed the need of switching to this new scheme and the possible domains where ECC can replace RSA, partially if not completely, in the near future. © 2016 IEEE.",Abelian Group; cryptographic security; Digital Signatures; Electronic Mail security; Elliptic Curves; forgery; high security; private key; public key; public key cryptography; RSA; trapdoor; weak keys,Cryptography; Electronic document identification systems; Electronic mail; Functions; Geometry; Group theory; Mobile commerce; Network security; Public key cryptography; Abelian group; Cryptographic security; Elliptic curve; forgery; High securities; Private key; Public keys; trapdoor; Weak key; Mobile security,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

As usage of cloud is increasing, critical and personal data is also being outsourced making it important to maintain confidentiality and integrity of this data. A basic way of protecting data is encrypting it before outsourcing, but the retrieval of required files from the encrypted cloud becomes a problem which requires searching over the encrypted data. Various schemes have been proposed to deal with this issue of searching over encrypted cloud data, however none of the existent schemes provide optimum user search experience resembling plaintext search. In this paper we propose Privacy Preserving Synonym Based Fuzzy Multi-Keyword Ranked Search Over Encrypted Cloud Data, a scheme which enhances user search experience to a paramount by providing both fuzzy and synonym based multi-keyword ranked search, thereby taking encrypted search experience closer to free text search engines. The scheme additionally improves upon index generation time and search time in comparison to existing schemes by utilizing a binary tree based dynamic index. Experimental results portray the effectiveness of this proposed scheme as it reduces the search time, i.e. the time for finding the desired documents, by 90% along with minimizing overhead of updating index when new files need to be uploaded (index generation time) as compared to the existing efficient indexing schemes in literature for a similar dataset. Optimization of search time together with index generation time has not been achieved to this extent before. © 2016 IEEE.",cloud computing; cloud security; encrypted cloud; fuzzy search; multi-keyword ranked search; synonym search,Binary trees; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Semantics; Cloud securities; Dynamic indices; Encrypted searches; Free-text search; Fuzzy searches; Multi keywords; Privacy preserving; synonym search; Search engines,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Several user authentication schemes are proposed in the literature. However, most of them are either vulnerable to different known attacks or they are inefficient. Recently, Althobaiti et al. presented a biometric-based user authentication scheme for WSNs. Although their scheme is efficient in computation, in this paper, we first show that their scheme has several security pitfalls such as (i) it is not resilient against node capture attack; (ii) it is insecure against impersonation attack; and (iii) it is insecure against man-in-the-middle attack. We then aim to propose a novel biometric-based user authentication scheme suitable for WSNs in order to withstand the security pitfalls found in Althobaiti et al. scheme. We show through the rigorous security analysis that our scheme is secure and satisfies the desirable security requirements. Furthermore, the simulation results for the formal security verification using the most widely used and accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool indicate that our scheme is secure. Our scheme is also efficient compared with existing related schemes. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In order to overcome such problem a new Natural image based Visual Secret Sharing (NVSS) scheme was presented. Using NVSS scheme one can distribute a secret image using n-1 natural images and one noise image. It does not modify the contents of natural images. The encryption phase extracts features of every natural image. The secret image is converted to a share by performing computations on secret image and feature extracted from natural images. On the other hand the secret image is retrieved by performing computations on the share and the feature extracted from natural images. This scheme can be used to decrease the risk of transmission and also resolve the management problems. In our proposed system steganography is included to NVSS scheme to securely transfer data by hiding it behind the secret image. To increase the security further this secret data is encrypted before performing steganography. Hence the secret data is in encrypted format. This secret image is then converted into share which is finally embedded in cover image. This proposed scheme is able to share black and white, grey level or color images secretly. Also this scheme is easy to implement. © 2016 IEEE.",Data hiding; natural images; transmission risk; visual secret sharing,Cryptography; Discrete cosine transforms; Steganography; Color images; Data hiding; Image security; Management problems; Natural images; Risk of transmissions; Secret images; Visual secret sharing; Image processing,,Swaroop A.Singh M.Astya P.N.Sharma V.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

It provides facilities for users to use cloud applications or platform without the need of any software installation and access the data or application from anywhere, with the help of internet. The cloud computing is divided into three fragments: Application, Service and Platform. Each of fragment provides different cloud services for business and individuals. Many organizations use this cloud service without any software, they run all their applications on the cloud and use on demand services. In Cloud, consumers, store their personal files or data on cloud server and consumers use that data or files whenever needed. Many consumers store or place their personal data on the cloud, so security and privacy are very important issue in cloud. These two issues can lead to a number of security concerns related to data transmission, integrity control, access control, identity management, logging and auditing, etc. Yet, research in the area of cloud computing receiving great attention from industry, academia and government. Since these domains have numerous complex issues, there are multiple open problems for research and opportunities for making noteworthy contributions, one of these issues is the data transmission in cloud computing.

It is quite difficult to efficiently achieve the source location privacy although the confidentiality of the messages can be well assured through data encryption. In WSN, the source location privacy is more complex due to the fact that the nodes comprise low-power and low-cost devices. The protocols based on large-scale communications are not suitable for WSN.

This paper proposes an aggregate-key cryptosystem in which decryption key generation mechanism is so powerful that the generated aggregate key is able to decrypt any subset of cipher text classes generated during data upload. However the situation like modification of files in cloud environment is also discussed in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.,Cloud storage; Data sharing; Dynamic auditing; Elliptic curve cryptography (ecc); Encryption; Key-Aggregate cryptosystem,Aggregates; Digital storage; Geometry; Public key cryptography; Cloud environments; Cloud storages; Cryptographic implementation; Data Sharing; Elliptic curve cryptography; Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC); Key generation; Security mechanism; Cryptography,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Unlike existing attribute-based encryption and signature schemes that require the user to perform significant amount of elliptic curve bilinear pairings and modular exponentiations, and require the user to hold a significantly long decryption/signature key, in our schemes the user is not required to perform any bilinear pairings. With a fixed length private key, independent of the number of attributes, the cloud user performs only few exponentiations by which he/she is able to authenticate himself/herself to the remote server and establish a session key with the server with the condition that he/she satisfies a predefined level of the server’s attributes requirement.

The bilinear pairing and the MTP function are time-consuming operations and they need a large super-singular elliptic curve group. Moreover, the cryptosystems based on them are difficult to implement and less efficient for practical use.

Our scheme is secure based on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Our construction implies: 1.A new construction for reusable garbled circuits that achieves stronger security than the only known prior construction [GKP+13].2.A new construction for bounded collusion functional encryption with substantial efficiency benefits: our public parameters and ciphertext size incur an additive growth of O(Q2), where Q is the number of permissible queries (We note that due to a lower bound [AGVW13], the ciphertext size must necessarily grow with Q). Additionally, the ciphertext of our scheme is succinct, in that it does not depend on the size of the circuit. By contrast, the prior best construction [GKP+13, GVW12] incurred a multiplicative blowup of O(Q4) in both the public parameters and ciphertext size. However, our scheme is secure in a weaker game than [GVW12]. Additionally, we show that existing LWE based predicate encryption schemes [AFV11, GVW15] are completely insecure against a general functional encryption adversary (i.e. in the “strong attribute hiding” game). We demonstrate three different attacks, the strongest of which is applicable even to the inner product predicate encryption scheme [AFV11]. Our attacks are practical and allow the attacker to completely recover x from its encryption Enc(x) within a polynomial number of queries. This illustrates that the barrier between predicate and functional encryption is not just a limitation of proof techniques.

A limitation of the LLR test statistic is that its application requires the full knowledge of the corresponding distribution. Previous work using the chi-squared approach required approximating the distribution of the relevant test statistic by chi-squared and normal distributions. Problematic issues regarding such approximations have been reported in the literature. Perhaps more importantly, both the LLR and the chi-squared based methods are applicable only if the success probability PSis greater than 0.5. On the other hand, an attack with success probability less than 0.5 is also of considerable interest. This work proposes a new test statistic for key recovery attacks which has the following features. Its application does not require the full knowledge of the underlying distribution; it is possible to carry out an analysis using this test statistic without using any approximations; the method applies for all values of the success probability. The statistical analysis of the new test statistic follows the hypothesis testing framework and uses Hoeffding’s inequalities to bound the probabilities of Type-I and Type-II errors. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Chi-squared statistic Hoeffding inequality; LLR statistic; Multiple linear cryptanalyis,Cryptography; Knowledge management; Lunar surface analysis; Normal distribution; Probability; Probability distributions; Statistical methods; Statistical tests; Testing; Chi-squared distribution; Hoeffding inequality; Key recovery attacks; Linear approximations; Log likelihood ratios (LLR); Multiple linear cryptanalyis; Type I and type II errors; Underlying distribution; Statistics,"Samajder, S.; Applied Statistics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 203, B.T.Road, India; email: subhabrata_r@isical.ac.in",Phan R.C.-W.Yung M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

There are different risks and attacks still exist that can breach user privacy. Online social network such as Facebook, Google Plus and LinkedIn provide a feature that allows finding out number of mutual friends (NMF) between two users. Adversary can use such information to identify individual user and his/her connections. As published dataset itself reveals mutual friends information for each connection, it becomes very easy for an adversary to re-identify the individual user. Existing anonymization techniques for mutual friends attack are based on edge anonymization. It performs edge anonymization operation without considering the NMF-requirement of other edges that results into more edge insertion operations. Due to that, the data utility of anonymized dataset is very low. In this paper, we propose the anonymization approach that works on the mutual friend sequence. It ensures that, there exist at least k elements in mutual friend sequence that holds same value. The vertex selection process to increase the number of mutual friend (NMF) for one edge reduces the mutual friend anonymization requirement for other edges too. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed anonymization approach preserve the privacy and the utility of the published dataset against mutual friend attack. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Data utility; k-NMF; Mutual friend attack; Social network data publishing,Cryptography; Anonymization; Attack prevention; Data utilities; Insertion operations; Mutual friend attack; Network data; On-line social networks; Vertex selection; Social networking (online),"Macwan, K.R.; Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: kamal.macwan@yahoo.com",Ali S.S.Eisenbarth T.Danger J.-L.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In the current work, we present a new technique for encrypting digital images based upon the pixel shuffling combined with changing pixel values using 128-bit secret key using henon chaotic map. Chaotic maps are characterized by their high sensitivity towards the initial parameters, which makes it a natural choice for developing a dynamic permutation matrix or as it is mostly called, permutation map. So we used chaotic Henon map in order to dynamically generate the permutation matrix. The initial parameters of the chaotic map and the secret key for changing the pixel values are derived from an external secret key. Horizontal and vertical permutations are used to perform pixel shuffling. Shuffling is used to destroy the correlation among the neighbour or adjacent image pixels, also it helps in increasing diffusion in the image. The proposed scheme is tested against a series of tests to measure its performance. Results of such tests indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive towards the encryption key and showed high resistance against various brute-force or statistical attacks. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

But, IoT is mostly affected with severe security challenges due to the potential vulnerabilities happened through the multiple connectivity of sensors, devices and system. In order to handle the security challenges, literature presents a handful of security protocols for IoT. The purpose of this paper is to present a threat profiling and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based mutual and multi-level authentication for the security of IoTs.

The message called Position-Aware and Secure Efficient Mesh Routing which has been sent from one node to another during the data communication. When the communication takes places among nodes, packet data is sent from one node to another node which can cause a chance of falling the nodes in the attackers trap and routing between the nodes may get lost due to concussion. Hence the security level of the data communication is very low. Due to these reasons the performance is very poor due to high node density. The user position information cannot able to identify the location of sending the messages from source and destination due to size of the message is less. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a new method is proposed called Multi-Key Generation, which uses different encryption and decryption multiple key pairs in order to overcome security problem, and to verify the message from falling on attacker's trap an algorithm is introduced called Digital Signature Algorithm, this method which improves the security level by detecting the attackers and performance of the node density will be improved. © 2017 IEEE.",Digital Signature; PASER Message; Secure Routing; Wireless Mesh Networks,Authentication; Convolutional codes; Cryptography; Electronic document identification systems; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Data-communication; Digital signature algorithms; Encryption and decryption; PASER Message; Position information; Secure routing; Security and performance; Security problems; Network security,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,English,"Proc.

The basic notion of PRE provides security against the proxy from learning anything about the encrypted message given the re-encryption key. However, this is not sufficient in all situations as the proxy can collude with Bob and re-delegate Alice’s decryption rights. Hence, non-transferability is a desirable property in real-time scenarios wherein an illegal attempt to transfer Alice’s decryption rights exposes Bob’s private key as a penalty.

Later Attrapadung (Asiacrypt 2016) extended this idea in prime order groups. Yamada et al. (PKC 2011, PKC 2012) and Nandi et al. (ePrint Archive: 2015/457, AAECC 2017) proposed generic conversion frameworks to achieve CCA-secure PE from CPA-secure PE provided the encryption schemes have properties like delegation or verifiability. The delegation property is harder to achieve and verifiability based conversion degrades the decryption performance due to a large number of additional pairing evaluations. Blömer et al. (CT-RSA 2016) proposed a direct fully CCA-secure predicate encryption in composite order groups but it was less efficient as it needed a large number of pairing evaluations to check ciphertext consistency. As an alternative, Nandi et al. (ePrint Archive: 2015/955) proposed a direct conversion technique in composite order groups. We extend the direct conversion technique of Nandi et al. in the prime order groups on the CPA-secure PE construction by Attrapadung (Asiacrypt 2016) and prove our scheme to be CCA-secure in a quite different manner. Our first direct CCA-secure predicate encryption scheme requires exactly one additional ciphertext component and three additional units of pairing evaluation during decryption. The second construction requires exactly three additional ciphertext components but needs only one additional unit pairing evaluation during decryption.

A broadcast encryption with personalized messages (BEPM) skillfully sends the broadcast message to a group of users together with the personalized messages to individual users. This article identifies constructional flaws in the BEPM scheme of Xu et al. and designs three BEPM constructions, namely, BEPM-I, BEPM-II and BEPM-III. BEPM-I, BEPM-III are selectively secure. Unlike the existing similar works, these schemes eliminate the need of storing public key and secret key for transmitting personalized messages. We emphasize that BEPM-III employs multilinear maps and achieves logarithmic size public parameter with increasing computation cost. More positively, BEPM-II achieves adaptive security with the parameter size and computation cost as in the existing BEPM. All our constructions have constant communication cost and proven to be secure in the standard security model under reasonable assumptions in generic group model.

This concept can be used with the various multimedia such as text, image, video, audio acting as cover medium to carry out the one way exchange or two way exchange of secret information. The presented paper focusses only on the kind of steganography that uses audio as a carrier. This concept of steganography is, act of encoding mystery data in invisible manner. Steganography along with cryptography add a step futher in security by hiding cipher text in such a manner that middle man is unaware about the secret message is concealed in it. Cipher text generated by encryption creates suspects but steganography creates environment that looks like normal behavior, hiding suspect nature of cipher text thus making it more secure. Audio steganography is the investigation of concealing a few mystery content or audio data in a host audio. This paper presents execution of two level security of end user information by associating the two fields of system security, cryptography and steganography. Concept of index based chaotic sequence is used for encryption. It carries two approaches which make the cryptanalysis and steganalysis furthermore difficult as compare to simple LSB method. First approach is encrypting the secret text using index based chaotic sequence. The proposed approach is more secure, strong and robust, giving security to our secret information. Second approach is hiding output generated by first approach using the concept of LSB with XOR method. It gives extra level of security by creating minimum distortion in host audio file simultaneously maintaining high embedding capacity. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this document, the authors have suggested a secure and robust three-factor (such as password, smartcard and biometric) based authentication scheme by using RSA cryptosystem. The proposed protocol is validated through BAN logic. Then, formal security analysis using random oracle model shows that the identity, password, biometric and session key are highly secure from an adversary.

It provides a player the platform to explore the exponential complexity of the game through their intellectual moves in the game. Though, the number of players, pieces, and board dimension and squares are finite, it is a game where the combination of moves for each player will change distinctly from game to game. Now, moving onto the field of Cryptography, which aims to achieve security for the data by encrypting it, and makes the plain text unintelligible for the intruders. Taking advantage of the numerous moves in the game of Chess, we can form an amalgamation of Chess game and cryptography. Chessography is the confluence of the game of Chess and Cryptography. Encryption will take place in the form of moves played by each player on the board. Resulting cipher text produced will be a Product Cipher, where the square positions on the game board will be substituted by new square positions during the move in the game and all the actual values dealt with, throughout the game will form the transposed cipher text. Chessography algorithm uses two keys, one fixed length and one variable length key called as ‘paired key’. Along with the strength of keys generated, this algorithm generates a very strong cipher text as each game of chess is different, so is the cipher text generated.

A number of secure routing protocols have been proposed by different researchers but enhancement of a single network parameter (i.e. security) may affect another performance metrics significantly i.e. throughput, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio etc. In order to ensure secure routing with improved network metrics, a Secure Buffer based Routing Protocol i.e. SBRP is proposed which ensures better network performance with increased level of security. SBRP protocol uses buffers at alternate positions to fasten re-routing mechanism during node/link failure and ensures the security using AES encryption.

Steganography is one of the ways used for secure communication, where people cannot feel the existence of the secret information.

In this paper two parallel algorithms— parallel RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman) cryptosystem with 2D-DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) steganography and parallel chaotic 2D-DCT steganography —have been proposed. The performance of both algorithms for larger images is determined and chaotic steganography is proved to be an efficient algorithm for larger messages. The parallelized version also proves to have reduced processing time than serial version with the speed-up ratios of 1.6 and 3.18. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Chaos; Communication; Encryption; Frequency domain; Information security; RSA; Steganography,Chaos theory; Communication; Computer vision; Cryptography; Digital image storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Image coding; Security of data; Steganography; Computation time; Discrete cosine transformation; Frequency domains; Parallel implementations; Parallelized version; Processing time; Rivest-shamir-adleman; Secret information; Image processing,"Savithri, G.; School of Computing Science and Engineering (SCSE), VIT UniversityIndia; email: savithri.g2015@vit.ac.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The method does not involve pixel expansion and image recovery is lossless. However, use of Hill Cipher requires a2 × 2integermatrixwhose inverse should also be an integer matrix. Further, to extend the method for multi-secret sharing, one requires higher order integer matrices. This needs heavy computation and the choice of matrices is also very restricted, due to integer entry constraints. In the present paper we introduce an RG-based Visual Secret Sharing Scheme (VSS) scheme using image interleaving and affine cipher. Combined effect of image interleaving and affine transformation helps in improving the security of the secret images. Parameters of the affine cipher serve as keys and the random grid and encrypted image form the shares. No one can reveal the secret unless the keys and both the shares are known. Further, as opposed to the method in [1], the present scheme does not require invertible matrix with integer inverse. The scheme is also extended for multi-secret sharing. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Affine cipher; Image interleaving; Pixel correlation,Computer vision; Cryptography; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Pixels; Affine ciphers; Affine transformations; Encrypted images; Image interleaving; Integer matrices; Invertible matrices; Multi-secret sharing; Visual secret sharing schemes; Image processing,"Kaur, H.; PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and ManufacturingIndia; email: harkeerat.kaur@iiitdmj.ac.in",Kumar S.Raman B.Roy [initials]P.P.Sen D.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

User’s sensitive data present in the storage server is expected to be highly available, secured and easily accessible from anywhere according to the demand in time. This paper provides a preventive maintenance approach to access the data, though storage server containing the sensitive data fails. This approach uses a simultaneous copying technique to save the data on both storage server and backup server during the upload process. Thus, when server fails, the data needs of the user can be served by the backup server. Data file is broken into data blocks and these blocks are encrypted and stored in the storage server instead of directly uploading the sensitive data file. Thus, when an intruder gains access to the storage server and tries to access the data, retrieval of the data file is not possible since mapping of files on the data blocks is random and encrypted. This supports preventive maintenance of data which not only secures data but also reduces risk and cost of recovery. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Data deduplication; Preventive maintenance; Sensitive data,Computation theory; Cryptography; Intelligent computing; Maintenance; Preventive maintenance; Random access storage; Back-up servers; Data blocks; Data de duplications; Data files; Sensitive datas; Storage and retrievals; Storage servers; User data; Digital storage,"Madhusudhan, V.; Dayananda Sagar College of EngineeringIndia; email: vmadhusudhan91@gmail.com",Udgata S.K.Bhateja V.Pattnaik P.K.Satapathy S.C.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Number of methods in the biometric and cryptography has been proposed for secured message communication. Cryptography based security that employed cryptographic keyswhich are generated using various key generation algorithms. However, a user has to remember the cryptographic key or maintain it in the database in secure manner by his own risk. Once the stored key is compromised, then an attacker can access the user’s data easily. This motivates us to develop a new security mechanism to protect the user’s persona data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate a biometric-based cryptography key generation using fingerprint data of a user. With respect to the security aspects, our approach is secure and more flexible for the key generation. This key can be used to encrypt the user’s personal data.

The SEAP protocol is a server coordination-based pairwise symmetric key management protocol which works on a hierarchical network architecture and supports dynamic membership. Besides, the protocol uses a passive external membership granting server (MGS) to provide stronger security. To ensure efficiency, the protocol uses only symmetric key cryptography, and to achieve storage scalability, it makes use of a pseudo random function (PRF). The protocol is also robust against authentication server (AS) compromise. We have formally proved the correctness of the security guarantees provided by the SEAP protocol using the strand space verification model.

Users can get a variety of services such as high computation power, storage, etc. Thus, applications of users can be more cost-effectively put on cloud by utilizing various commodity computers together. But, cloud computing faces some security concerns even if they provides many services. Some of such important concerns are data security and privacy of data. Some personal data like personal healthcare records and financial records contain sensitive information which can be analyzed and mined for public researches although these records offer important human assets. Data should be privacy preserved because malicious cloud users or untrusted cloud providers can get the data with less effort. To deal with these problems, privacy-aware set-valued data publishing on cloud for personal healthcare records has been proposed. An efficient privacy-aware system, named PHKEM (Personal Healthcare k-anonymity Encryption Model), for eliminating privacy breaches in publishing of personal healthcare data on cloud as well as data querying is designed. A data anonymization technique, named k-Anonymity with extended quasi-identifier partitioning (EQI-partitioning), interactive differential privacy, and AES encryption is applied to preserving personal healthcare records to prevent unauthorized access.

PSI allows entities to securely extract intersection of the large data sets they own, without revealing any other crucial information for their input sets. Fairness is a critical issue for both mutual Private Set Intersection (mPSI) and its cardinality variant, namely mutual Private Set Intersection Cardinality (mPSI-CA). Achieving fairness over prime order groups with linear complexity in malicious model remains an interesting challenge for both mPSI and mPSI-CA. None of the prior works achieve all the aforementioned properties together. We address these issues using an off-line semi-trusted third party, called arbiter. Arbiter is semi-trusted in the sense that he cannot get access to the private information of the parties but follow the protocol honestly.

The two input mages are first phase encoded and each of them are then multiplied with SPMs and Fresnel propagated with distances d1 and d2, respectively. The single-level discrete WT is applied to Fresnel propagated complex images to decompose each into sub-band matrices i.e. LL, HL, LH and HH. Further, the sub-band matrices of two complex images are interchanged after modulation with random phase masks (RPMs) and subjected to inverse discrete WT. The resulting images are then both added and subtracted to get intermediate images which are further Fresnel propagated with distances d3 and d4, respectively. These outputs are finally gyrator transformed with the same angle ? to get the encrypted images. The proposed technique provides enhanced security in terms of a large set of security keys. The sensitivity of security keys such as SPM parameters, GT angle ?, Fresnel propagation distances are investigated. The robustness of the proposed techniques against noise and occlusion attacks are also analysed.

Many onward-thinking countries are adopting the electronic voting system to upgrade their election process. E-voting system is more complicated to construct. Thus it expects more security as compared to the postal voting system. The objective of the paper is twofold. Firstly, we proposed an efficient blind signature scheme using the identity-based cryptosystem in the random oracle model. The proposed scheme uses the combination of Boldyreva’s blind signature scheme and Choon-Cheon’s Identity-based signature. Additionally, we reduce its security to the Gap Diffie-Hellman Complexity (GDH). Under the adaptive chosen message and ID attacks it is secure against existential forgery attack. We show our proposed system performed better as compared to existing systems. Secondly, we construct an E-voting system based on our ID-based blind signature and Boneh’s short signature scheme (EVS-ID-BS) that fulfills the E-voting security requirements. To the best of our knowledge, EVS-ID-BS is the first practical implementation of E-voting system based on ID-BS Scheme which is constructed in the random oracle model. Proposed EVS-ID-BS scheme provides batch verifiability for a significantly large number of voters, needs less bandwidth cost and require less interaction with election authority. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Bilinear pairing; Blind signature; E-voting system; Elliptic curve cryptosystem; ID-based blind signature,Authentication; Cryptography; Electronic document identification systems; Information systems; Public key cryptography; Bilinear pairing; Blind signature scheme; Blind signatures; E-voting systems; Electronic voting systems; Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem; Identity based signature; Identity-based cryptosystem; Voting machines,"Kumar, M.; School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru UniversityIndia; email: mahendjnu1989@gmail.com",Vaidya J.Shyamasundar R.K.Singh V.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The solution aims at achieving Confidentiality using CP-ABE (Ciphertext Policy-Attribute Based Encryption) and user authentication with Multifactor Authentication (MFA). Security is achieved in various levels such as providing static username-password as the entry level authentication, followed by OTP based on token generator technique. These tokens are generated using QR code technology and act as credentials for each user.The provision of default tokens is also available for genuine users that fail to use the QR code generator at some point.

The mode of this work is to increase accuracy with less data storage and providing high security authentication system using multimodal biometrics. The proposed biometric system uses two modalities, palm print and palm vein. The preprocessing steps begin with image acquisition of palm print and palm vein images using visible and infrared radiations, respectively. From the acquired image, region of interest (ROI) is extracted. The extracted information is encrypted using encryption algorithms. By this method of encryption, after ROI extraction, the storage of data consumes less memory and also provides faster access to the information. The encrypted data of both modalities are fused using advanced biohashing algorithm. At the verification stage, the image acquired is subjected to ROI extraction, encryption and biohashing procedures. The biohash code is matched with the information in database using matching algorithms, providing fast and accurate output.

The (n, n) Group Authentication Scheme is very efficient since it is sufficient to authenticate all users at once if all users are group members; however, if there are nonmembers, it can be used as a preprocess before applying conventional user authentication to identify non-members. Also, if any of the user present in group authentication is absent then the group is not authenticated at all, as each share is distributed to each user. It results in best authenticated system as the hacker cannot hack each share in a secret.

An improved RSA variant is designed by adding MultiPrime feature to Dual RSA on the decryption side to increase the decryption speed. The proposed variant is designed to have low decryption cost with better memory usage in case when two instances of RSA are required. For the same encryption speed, the decryption speed of the proposed variant becomes 2 times faster than Dual RSA and the memory consumption gets reduced by approximately 170 bits. Conclusion: Furthermore, many of the existing attacks are proved to be ineffective for the proposed variant. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Communication; Complexity; Cryptography; Encryption; Public Key; Security,,"Verma, S.; Computer Science Department, Amity UniversityIndia; email: seemaknl@gmail.com",,Bentham Science Publishers B.V.,22103279,,,,English,Int.

The method is supposed to work well whenever there is a suitable numerical feature vector having different statistical distributions under the different classes.

Furthermore, encrypted significant data is compressed by quantization and entropy coding while, less significant encrypted data is efficiently compressed by discarding irrelevant information using SVD and Huffman coding techniques. At receiver side, a reliable decompression and decryption technique is used to reconstruct the original image content with the help of compressed bit streams and secret keys.

This work is based on cluster based routing since energy consumption is effectively reduced throughout the network. Since, it has to improve network life time for the large simulation period.

Progressively, often, data needs to be shared among the unreliable entities. In this field, one interesting and common problem occurs when two parties want to secretly determine the intersection or cardinality of intersection of their respective private sets. PSI or its variants are ideal to solve the aforementioned problems. Existing solutions of mPSI and mPSI-CA mainly use trusted third party to achieve fairness. However, in real life, the unconditional trust is fraught with security risks as the trusted third party may be unfaithful or corrupted. As a consequence, construction of an efficient mPSI-CA preserving fairness remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we address this issue by employing an off-line third party, called arbiter, who is assumed to be semi-trusted in the sense that he does not have access to the private information of the entities while he will follow the protocol honestly. In this work, we design a construction of fair and efficient mPSI-CA utilizing Bloom filter.

Digital signatures have expanded rapidly along with mathematical advances in lattices, pairings and elliptic curves. Due to their high efficiency and strong security properties, the elliptic curve cryptographic schemes remain the best option for many security goals. Pairing free signature schemes on elliptic curves is an emerging area of interest for efficient community. To deal with specific application scenarios, digital signature schemes have evolved into many variants. One of such variant is Directed signature scheme. A directed signature is a kind of signature where the verification ability is controlled by the signer. Here the validity of the signature can be verified by a designated verifier only and nobody knows anything about the verifier. Directed signature schemes are suitable for applications where message is sensitive to recipient; for example bill of tax and health. In this paper we propose an efficient and secure pairing free Identity (ID) based directed signature (IDBDS) scheme over elliptic curves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme in ID based setting addressing about directedness in pairing free environment. We prove its security using random oracle model under the assumption that the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) is hard. We compare our scheme with well known existing schemes and efficiency analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient than all other related schemes. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Directed signatures; ECDL problem; Identity based signature; Public Key Cryptography; Random oracle security model,Cryptography; Efficiency; Electronic document identification systems; Geometry; Network security; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Cryptographic schemes; Digital signature schemes; Directed signatures; ECDL problem; Electronic communications; Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems; Identity based signature; Security model; Authentication,"Gayathri, N.B.; Department of Engineering Mathematics, Andhra UniversityIndia; email: gayatricrypto@gmail.com",Martinez Perez G.Gomez Marmol F.Thampi S.M.Westphall C.B.Fan C.I.Hu J.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

This helps the people to store their huge data in to the cloud and to access it from anywhere. The individuals rely upon the Cloud Storage Providers (CSP) like Amazon, Dropbox, Google Drive, Firebase etc. for storing their information in the cloud due to the lack of storage space in their Mobile phones. The main concern in cloud storage is its privacy. To obtain privacy the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability has to be maintained. This paper addresses about the development of a new Android application that will provide the cloud users to store the geotagged secret image in the form of shares in to various CSP and reconstruct the secret image back by combining the shares. This key idea will provide security to the stored data. Here in this paper we also propose a (1, k, n) secret image sharing scheme constructed by using (k-1, n-1) secret image sharing scheme. An image encryption scheme is also addressed as a building block which is used for mitigating the collusive attacks by CSPs.

However, the primary memory required to execute the attack was 4 TB making it difficult to implement which is supported by the fact that there are no reported implementations of the attack. We propose a data-memory tradeoff for the attack which lets us reduce memory needed at the expense of increased data complexity. We have been able to implement the attack using 128.5 GB of primary memory and 232 data complexity.

Recently, in 2013, Zhao et al. proposed an efficient routing integrated framework for MANETs. They claimed that their proposed scheme distributes the system parameter only to the authenticate nodes before network set up phase. However, based on cryptanalysis, we have found that an unauthenticated nodes are also be able to get that original system parameter and behave like a malicious node in the network. Thus, their scheme fails to provide an authenticate distribution mechanism in real life application.

Limited or no network connectivity, absence of valid encryption/decryption protocols, and the individual metrics concerning the sender are some of the problems that plague newly established networks [1]. Existing techniques to overcome these problems do not address future concerns such as scalability, security, etc. The generation of a valid key that does not need to be changed or managed regularly is essential to a newly established network as it offloads the computational overhead and reduces the connection cost to a fraction of what it was before. This paper explores the possibility of generating such a key making use of acoustic model training and voice-tag creation. It also provides an overview for simple, efficient, and easy addition or deletion of members to cooperative groups, while keeping the rekeying mechanism as flexible as possible so as to increase the network’s robustness. The implementation is designed in such a way that the group size does not factor into the computational overhead or the communication cost. The strong encryption protocol detailed in this paper, along with a simple and easy way to manage the implementation, makes this a viable solution to the problems that are associated with new networks. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Access control; Ad hoc networks; Broadcast; Cooperative computing; Information security; Key management,Access control; Ad hoc networks; Broadcasting; Security of data; Acoustic model trainings; Computational overheads; Cooperative computing; Encryption protocols; Encryption/decryption; Established networks; Key management; Voice authentication; Cryptography,"Amith, T.A.; Dayanand Sagar College of EngineeringIndia; email: amith.tallanki@gmail.com",Bhateja V.Satapathy S.C.Joshi A.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Now, DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is explored as a new carrier for data security since it achieves maximum protection and powerful security with high capacity and low modification rate. A new data security method can be developed by taking the advantages of DNA based AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cryptography and DNA steganography. This new technique will provide multilayer security to the secret message. Here the secret message is first encoded to DNA bases then DNA based AES algorithm is applied to it.

It is mainly used in various cryptographic algorithms such as the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Twofish etc. The multiplication in a finite field is considered as highly complex and resource consuming operation in such applications. Many algorithms and architectures are proposed in the literature to obtain efficient multiplication operation in both hardware and software. In this paper, a modified serial multiplication algorithm with interleaved modular reduction is proposed, which allows for an efficient realization of a sequential polynomial basis multiplier. The proposedsequential multiplier supports multiplication of any two arbitrary finite field elements over GF(2m) for generic irreducible polynomials, therefore made versatile. Estimation of area and time complexities of the proposed sequential multiplier is performed and comparison with existing sequential multipliers is presented. The proposed sequential multiplier achieves 50% reduction in area-delay product over the best of existing sequential multipliers for m = 163, indicating an efficient design in terms of both area and delay.

This involves a sequence of modulo square and multiply operations which, if known, enables an adversary to obtain the DSA private key. Cache-based side channel attacks are able to recover only discontiguous blocks of the ephemeral key thanks to the sliding window optimization implemented in many crypto libraries. Further, noisy side channels, rarely addressed in the literature, greatly complicate key retrieval. Through extensive experiments, we obtain estimates of the error rate as a function of block position and size. We demonstrate key retrieval in the presence of noise and model the time complexity of key recovery as a function of error rate. Our model exposes the tradeoff between number of signature operations that need to be monitored and the computational requirements for the attack.

This paper first demonstrates the fact that the instruction counts can act as a side-channel and then describes the Instruction Profiling Attack (IPA) methodology with the help of two block ciphers, namely AES and Clefia, on Intel and AMD processors. We follow the principles of profiled instruction attacks and show that the proposed attack is more potent than the well-known cache timing attacks in literature. We also perform experiments on ciphers implemented with popular time fuzzing schemes to subvert timing attacks. Our results show that while the countermeasure successfully stops leakages through the timing channels, it is vulnerable to the Instruction Profiling Attack.

The transmission, being of a broadcast nature, is vulnerable to security threats and hence, the aspect of security provisioning in these networks has assumed an important dimension. The security of the transmitted data over a wireless channel aims at protecting the data from unauthorized access. The objective is achieved by providing advanced security mechanisms. Implementing strong security mechanisms however, affects the throughput performance and increases the complexity of the communication system. In this paper, we investigate the security performance of a WLAN based on IEEE 802.11b/g/n standards on an experimental testbed in congested and uncongested networks in a single and multi-client environment. Experimental results are obtained for a layered security model encompassing nine security protocols in terms of throughput, response time, and encryption overhead. The performance impact of transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol traffic streams on secure wireless networks has also been studied. Through numerical results obtained from the testbed, we have presented quantitative and realistic findings for both security mechanisms as well as network performance. The tradeoff between the strength of the security protocol and the associated performance is analyzed through computer simulation results.

In symmetric key cryptography it is difficult to send any key over any insecure channel as any moment the intruder may hack the key. In the present paper the authors have designed a method where any trivial secret key can be pre-decided between the sender and the receiver. This key is then embedded with the timestamp extracted from the machine in a random manner. The modified key can be used to encrypt any plain text. After the encryption is over the same time stamp will be embedded in the cipher text in random manner. The receiver has to first detect the time stamp and that is to be clubbed with predefined key for decryption purpose. The advantage of this method is that even if someone knows original key but he/she will fail to decrypt the cipher text as he/she has to know idea about the exact time stamp. The present method studied at different time span and the results found are quite satisfactory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group.",Brute force attack; Logarithmic spiral; Prime numbers; Symmetric key; Timestamp,Engineering; Industrial engineering; Brute-force attack; Logarithmic spiral; Prime number; Symmetric keys; Time-stamp; Cryptography,,Mukherjee S.Bhattacharjee A.K.Deyasi A.Debnath P.,CRC Press/Balkema,,9.78114E+12,,,English,Comput.

Further, this is enhanced from the general group elements to equivalent ring elements, known by the monomials generations for the cryptographic schemes.

However, concerns about outsourcing sensitive data cause privacy problems.

Any corruption, insider attack of data is possible in an outsourced data from users to cloud. All Participants in the sharing group can also able to modify data along with the access. If any user does any malicious activities, Group manager can revoke such user from group so revoked user cannot be part of sharing. The major challenges of data security is integrity of outsourced data in cloud is analyzed and proposes a privacy preserving public auditing mechanism where Third Party Auditor is used for integrity checking of data and Proxy resignature mechanism is used for re-signing keys for revoked users from the group.

We improved the result presented by Sasaki in Indocrypt 2012 by extending the number of rounds attacked from seven to eight for four-branch GFN. Furthermore, for eight-branch type-2 GFN with SSP functions, we present the first known key distinguishers. Our attack works up to 15 rounds of this GFN for all practical parameters. Subsequently, we extend the attack to 17 rounds for the same GFN, which works for most practical parameters. On the basis of our second result and the number of rounds attacked, we conclude that eight-branch type-2 GFN with SSP functions is weaker than four-branch type-Two GFN with DSP functions in the KKA model. We apply rebound attack technique to mount all three distinguishers.

The field of security engineering has emerged whereby security requirements are gathered along with other requirements during the initial phase of software development. However, dealing with security concerns during the initial phases of development is challenging because of design and code unavailability. The paper first represents the proposals for security requirements engineering based on different approaches such as use case approach, goal-oriented approach, and process-oriented approach. These methodologies are evaluated along various parameters such as security engineering activities covered, application domain and others.

Low cost leads to constraints in various resources of constituent devices of a IoT (e.g., sensors of a DSN); thereby restricting implementations of computationally heavy public key cryptosystems. This leads to adaptation of the novel key predistribution trick in symmetric key platform to efficiently tackle the problem of key management for these resource starved networks. After a few initial proposals based on random graphs, most key predistribution schemes (KPS) use deterministic (combinatorial) approaches to assure essential design properties. Combinatorial designs like a (v, b, r, k)?configuration which forms a ?(v, b, r, k)?CID are effective schemes to design KPS [20]. In this paper, we use bent Boolean functions to generate four combinatorial designs for the purpose of designing deterministic KPS. Of particular interest are our later (two) schemes that are constructed over Dillon’s bent Boolean function. Effectiveness of our solutions in term of crucial metrics in comparison to prominent schemes has been theoretically established. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Bent functions; Combinatorial designs; Distributed sensor networks; Internet of things; Key predistribution scheme(s); Partial spread,Boolean functions; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Sensor networks; Bent function; Combinatorial design; Distributed sensor networks; Key predistribution scheme; Partial spreads; Network security,"Dalai, D.K.; School of Mathematical Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research (HBNI)India; email: deepak@niser.ac.in",Chen K.Lin D.Yung M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In the proposed FDAS mechanism, a combination of fuzzy rules is applied to predict the node status of each node in the aggregation tree. The faulty nodes are then isolated from the process of data aggregation.

Cryptography is used to provide the high level of security to the data sent across the network by encryption and decryption process. An encryption key plays a vital role in the cryptographic operations which decides the strength of any cryptosystem. Many cryptographic attacks are achieved through breaking the key, enabling the attackers to tamper the system. Hence, to generate a strong key, an evolutionary method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper. The objective of this research work is to generate non-repetitive, non-predictable keys using Genetic Algorithm, which uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) bit symmetric block cipher algorithm to perform the cryptographic operations. The result shows that AES-128 enhanced with GA has less encryption and decryption time than the conventional AES-128.

A cooperative approach has been proposed as a solution where malicious behaviour of a node is tested whenever another node tries to send a message to it. Performance parameters, like received and sent messages to neighbouring nodes have been used along with calculated faith values (CFV) to derive latest CFVs. The process is repeated for each communication instance. In addition, a simple yet efficient credibility-based cryptographic encryption technique is applied to encrypt message contents that works by appending the signatures and CFV values of each encountered nodes. The method has been tested, by implementing it over the spray and wait DTN protocol, in the ONE simulator.

As it is vulnerable to malicious attackers with the open medium and wide distribution, network performance is degraded with the behavior attacks in MANET’s, which makes protection most important. In any ad hoc networks, one of the situations is that, when a data distributor possesses sensitive data destined to a set of supposedly trusted parties, some data can be leaked at an authorized place. With the introduction of fake objects the data allocation strategies gives a path in identifying leakages ensuring more security with encryption.

Digital signature is an authentication mechanism which generates a unique code with the message, now this attached code (i.e., signature) is responsible for the validation of sender and message. As all know that digital signature provides authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation services, but does not provide the confidentiality of data as well as signature which is most important during data transfer. This paper proposed a modified digital signature scheme for secure communication. This work includes the concept of public key encryption for secrecy of data. This work will reduce the well-known drawbacks of digital signature scheme. The aim of this technique is to provide the secure communication that includes the security for the data, private key, and digital signature. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",Digital signature; Encryption and decryption; Hash function; Prime numbers; Private key; Public key,Cryptography; Data transfer; Electronic document identification systems; Hash functions; Public key cryptography; Secure communication; Authentication mechanisms; Digital signature schemes; Encryption and decryption; Non-repudiation services; Prime number; Private key; Public keys; Public-key encryption; Authentication,"Khan, G.; Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, TMUIndia; email: gulista.khan@gmail.com",Singh R.Choudhury S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

The higher level of data privacy is mandatory to store and query the sensitive data in cloud-based information system applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Identity-based homomorphic encryption and tokenisation has proved its efficiency in providing privacy and simultaneously querying encrypted data. However, in cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, the adversary can run brute force attacks which can reveal the attribute values by colluding with the service provider. It is a significant challenge to detect and prevent such attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive solution using application-independent metrics consisting of different types of vulnerability measures. This paper also presents the detailed design of a system that uses application-independent metrics to prevent brute force attacks.

In order to address this issue, the existing approaches use piece-wise linear maps that speed up computations. High-dimensional linear maps have been chosen to avoid dynamical degradation. In this paper, we claim that a single one-dimensional nonlinear chaotic map can produce ergodic orbits in a fast manner. We propose a keyed hash function that takes advantage of the interplay between chaos-based dynamics and Bernoulli shift dynamics. The proposed Bernoulli keyed hash function proves to be an efficient scheme achieving speeds on par with the existing schemes in the literature. Extensive validation is carried out at byte, block and the whole message level for collision resistance and sensitivity to key analysis.

The medical image is watermarked in wavelet domain where in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is used as watermark and hospital logo as the reference image. Embedding of the EHR data is based on energy band selection and in reference to the bit location in the reference image A Composite algorithm for improved image security is proposed by taking the advantages of DNA based image encryption and genetic algorithms (GA). A number of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) masks are created using logistic map function and DNA conversion rules. Then encryption is performed on the watermarked image to generate a number of cipher images.

Industrial infrastructural needs like storage, computing has became like utilities that uses cloud. Features like availability, scalability, pay per use makes cloud as a dependable choice for enterprises. The growth of cloud computing depends on vital technologies like distributed computing, parallel processing, Internet, virtualization technologies, etc. Virtualization enables resources utilization in efficient way. It offers multi-tenancy which is sharing same physical space by many virtual machines. Co-residency of virtual machine on the other side brings more security bumps. As co-residents share common channels like memory bus, storage controllers, cache these channels can become sources of data leakage for malicious VMs. Malicious attacker VMs use covert channel for accessing sensible data from target VM. This paper presents a novel model Encryption First Split Next (EFSN) model for covert channel protection. This model targets about two key issues like isolating conflict of interest files from attacker using split share model.

Hence we propose a cryptographic model which will enhance the message security. A new method of round key selection is used, which provides better and enhanced security against intruder's attack. The crucial attraction of this proposed model is providing multi level security of 3 levels with round key selection and message encryption in level 1, 16×16 matrix manipulation using asymmetric key encryption in level 2 and shift operations in level 3.

Importantly our approach has constant communication complexity agnostic of the size of database which is major improvement from known schemes. We achieve these results by slightly relaxing the traditional requirements of PIR schemes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Encryption switching protocols; Homomorphic encryption; Private information retrieval,Computational complexity; Data privacy; Information retrieval; Query processing; Communication complexity; False negatives; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Private information retrieval; Public database; Switching protocols; Cryptography,"Dara, S.; Cisco Systems Inc.India; email: sadara@cisco.com",Ali S.S.Eisenbarth T.Danger J.-L.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

But systems based on non algebraic structures can also provide a considerable amount of security. Quasigroups are one such non algebraic structures.

As the information from the sensors are transmitted via public network and sensor nodes have limited battery, shift the focus on security and efficiency in WSNs. User authentication is the security task for limiting the access. It is achieved by equipping authorized users with passwords, tokens or biometrics. However, password and token are easy being stolen and forgotten; even biometrics inherit some limitation. More suitable approach is to combine both password and biometric authenticator to harvest benefits in security. This paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs using biohashing. Biohashing facilitates elimination of false accept rates without increasing occurrence of false rejection rate. Additionally, biohashing has highly clear separation of imposter populations and genuine, and zero equal error rate level. The proposed scheme also supports dynamic node addition and user friendly password change mechanism. Using the BAN-logic, we prove that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication. In addition, we simulate proposed scheme for the security against man-in-the middle attack and replay attack using the AVISPA tool, and the simulation results show that our scheme is safe. Through the informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against the known attacks for authentication protocols. © 2016",Authentication; Internet of things (IoT); Wireless sensor networks(WSNs),Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptography; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication and key agreements; Authentication protocols; Biometric authenticators; Internet of Things (IOT); Man in the middle attacks; Mutual authentication; User authentication scheme; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security,"Mishra, D.; Department of Mathematics, LNM Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: dheerendra@maths.iitkgp.ernet.in",,Elsevier B.V.,15708705,,,,English,Ad Hoc Netw.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994417483

Using self constructed alphabet matrices the plain text is converted into Unicode format for three Indian languages Tamil, Hindi and Kannadam. A new key generation algorithm is designed to select the language combination. In the second layer, the translated secret data is further encrypted by the method of diagonal indexing.

Most of the known efficient MPC protocols are designed in the offline-online framework introduced in a seminal work by Beaver in CRYPTO 1991. In this framework, the parties generate shared random and private multiplication-triples during the offline phase, which are used later in the online phase for securely evaluating the multiplication gates in the circuit representing f. The efficiency of the MPC protocols in this framework then relies on efficient ways of implementing the offline phase. In this paper, we propose a new and simple framework for generating shared and private random multiplication triples with unconditional security. The existing protocols approach this problem by first producing shared pairs of private and random values, followed by securely computing the shared product of each pair of values. The latter task involves a multiplication protocol for shared values that are typically communication intensive. Our framework takes a completely different approach and shuns the use of multiplication protocol. Namely, we ask the parties to verifiably share random multiplication triples and then securely extract shared random multiplication triples unknown to the adversary, from the shared triples. Realizing our framework in the asynchronous and hybrid network setting,1 we present the first ever MPC protocols with a linear (in the number of parties) communication overhead per multiplication gate in the circuit representing f. These are significant improvements over the best known existing MPC protocols in the asynchronous and hybrid network setting with communication complexity O(n2) and O(n3) , respectively. Our framework when applied to the synchronous setting results in round-efficient MPC protocols.1In a hybrid network, it is assumed that the network is synchronous up to a certain 'point' and asynchronous after that point onward. We assume a hybrid network with just one synchronous round in the beginning. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Cryptographic protocols; information-theoretic security; multiparty computation,Complex networks; Cryptography; Finite element method; Information theory; Communication complexity; Communication overheads; Cryptographic protocols; Hybrid network; Information- theoretic securities; Multiparty computation; Unconditional security; Unconditionally secure; Internet protocols,"Choudhury, A.; International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: ashish.choudhury@iiitb.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,189448,,IETTA,,English,IEEE Trans.

To publish such data for research or business applications, data may be collected at one site and published data to the needy. Publishing data in many fields like banking, medical, political, research, etc., by preserving one’s privacy is very important. Apart from preserving privacy, anonymity of the publisher must be preserved. To achieve these objectives in this paper, multidimensional k-anonymity with onion routing and mix-network methods are proposed to preserve privacy and to provide anonymous communication. Mix-net is a multistage system which accepts quantities of data on input batch and produces cryptographically transformed data through output batch. Output batch is a permutation of the transformed input batch, to achieve untraceability between the input and output batches. Mix-net can change the appearance and random reordering which prevents trace back. In onion routing encryption, data is encapsulated in layers of encryption, which is analogous to layers of onion. The data is being sent to transmit inside the several layers of encryption. The final node or exit node in the chain is to decrypt and deliver the data to the recipient by applying multidimensional kanonymity on collected data. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Anonymity; Data; Distributed; Hierarchical; Mix-network; Onion routing; Personal information; Privacy; Ring; Vertically partitioned,Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Data mining; Network routing; Publishing; Rings (components); Anonymity; Data; Distributed; Hierarchical; Mix networks; Onion routing; Personal information; Vertically partitioned; Data privacy,"Srinivas, R.; Department of CSE, ACETIndia; email: viceprincipal@acet.ac.in",Mohapatra D.P.Behera H.S.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Everyday application developers come up with new social networking sites. Consequently, these websites gain huge profit just by providing a platform for the users to communicate. It has already become an important integral part of our daily lives, enabling us to contact our friends and families on time. Since the count of the users of social networks is increasing drastically, storage of such huge amount of data is difficult to accomplish. As a solution, Cloud provides a platform to store this tiny amount of data. More and more social network data has been made publicly available and analyzed in one way or another. However, the issues in securing the data and privacy of users in cloud-based social networks persist. Users are unaware of these issues. They share various pictures, videos and personal data on the networking site which prevail even after deletion. But some of the information revealed is meant to be private hence social network data has led to the risk of leakage of confidential information of individuals. This is because they collect huge personal data and users take risks of trusting them. Since more personalized information is shared with the public, violating the privacy of a target user become much easier. Hence, security of the social networking data stored in the cloud is one of the major issues in cloud-based social networks. In this paper, we propose a framework for secure storing of data on the cloud-based social networks. The framework encrypts the data before storing it in the cloud, and the data is decrypted only with the private key of the user, making the data secure in the cloud.

In such scheme, a user possessing search key constructs search token at any time and consequently requests the server to search over encrypted data. Thus, an FE based MUSE scheme is not suitable for the applications where a log of search activities is maintained at the enterprise site to identify dishonest search query from any user. In addition, none of the existing searchable schemes provides security against token replay attack to avoid reuse of the same token. In this paper, therefore we propose an FE based scheme, Multiuser Searchable Encryption with Token Freshness Verification (MUSE-TFV). In MUSE-TFV, a user prepares one-time usable search token in cooperation with ETA and thus every search activity is logged at the enterprise site. Additionally, by verifying the freshness of a token, the server prevents reuse of the token. With formal security analysis, we prove the security of MUSE-TFV against chosen keyword attack and token replay attack. With theoretical and empirical analysis, we justify the effectiveness of MUSE-TFV in practical applications. © 2017 Dhruti Sharma and Devesh C.

So far, there has not been any clear justification why such constants are chosen. We concentrate on differential cryptanalysis to evaluate how different constants affect the biases after a few rounds in these ciphers. We are using Measure of Uniformity in bias as a measure for differentiating constants as good or bad constants w.r.t. original constant. We have observed that after 4 rounds of Salsa20, for an Input Differential (ID) at Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the third word of quarterround function, the specific patterns in constant involved in that quarterround function leads to increase or decrease in Measure of Uniformity in bias. The location of specific patterns in those diagonal constants varies with the change in last two rotation constants. We did not observe any pattern for ChaCha after 3 rounds. We have also observed a slight increase and decrease in time and data complexity for good and bad constants respectively as compared to an original constant. The designer constants are a good constant however it can be even better with a slight change in constant c0 or c3. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",ARX cipher; Bias; ChaCha; Constants; Hamming distance; Input differential; Measure of Uniformity in bias; Output differential; Salsa; Stream cipher,Hamming distance; ARX cipher; Bias; ChaCha; Constants; Input differential; Measure of Uniformity in bias; Output differential; Salsa; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,"Bathe, B.N.; Bhabha Atomic Research CentreIndia; email: bathebn@barc.gov.in",Ali S.S.Eisenbarth T.Danger J.-L.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

As with any network, communication among nodes plays an important role, when two nodes in a network communicate with each other via the Internet, secure authentication is an imperative challenge. In literature, there are many approaches that have been suggested to deliver a secure authentication between nodes in wireless mesh network (WMN), however, all these outlines contain some disadvantages, i.e. management cost of the public key and system complexity. Our suggested proposed approach is dealing with one of the wireless mesh network challenges, i.e. Mutual authentication. Here in this we have considered the three authentication techniques, i.e. Inter-, Intra-and Inter-Operator domain authentication. SAMD (Secure Authentication Scheme in Multi-Operator Domain) hides the location, communication path and network access and apart from that it will resist to the adversary, key forgery and modification attack. As a result, we have assessed the performance of the proposed design in terms of Authentication cost, Encryption cost, Key validation, Key Generation, Throughput and System Delay, which indicates our scheme more efficient than other schemes. Results show that it will efficiently work in real-time traffic. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.",,Authentication; Complex networks; Costs; Cryptography; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Public key cryptography; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Authentication cost; Authentication techniques; Communication path; Large-scale network; Modification attack; Mutual authentication; Real time traffics; Secure authentications; Network security,"Singh, N.; Department of Centre of Information Technology, University of Petroleum and Energy StudiesIndia; email: ninnisingh1991@gmail.com",Bhateja V.Joshi A.Satapathy S.C.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

Minalpher uses a new primitive called tweakable Even-Mansour, based on a permutation-based block-cipher proposed by Even and Mansour and to the best of our knowledge, no practical DFA has yet been reported on it. In the first DFA, only two random faults have been injected on two consecutive 4-bit nibbles (i.e. within total 8 bits) of a specific internal state. We show that (i) if both the faults are injected at the same nibble the key-space for the intermediate key can be reduced significantly from 2 256 to 2 32 and (ii) if the faults are injected at different positions, the key-space for the intermediate key can be reduced further to only 2 16. In the second DFA, we first consider two faults into a single nibble, which reduces the keyspace from 2 256 to 2 48. Moreover, we show that one additional fault (i.e. total three faults) helps to reduce the key-space significantly to 2 8. We can compute the correct intermediate key by observing a few more plain-text, cipher-text pairs, which helps in computing valid cipher-text, tag pairs for any message and associated data under a fixed nonce. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",DFA; Fault; Minalpher; Nibble; Tweakable even mansour,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Faulting; Block ciphers; Differential fault attack; Fault model; Internal state; Minalpher; Nibble; Random faults; Tweakable even mansour; Cryptography,"Datta, N.; Indian Institute of Technology, KharagpurIndia; email: nilanjan_isi_jrf@yahoo.com",Ali S.S.Eisenbarth T.Danger J.-L.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Thus, it is a major challenge before Cyber Clean operations run by various government agencies to monitor malicious activities in their official network.

In 1995, Roos pointed out that the elements SN[ y] of the permutation SN after the key scheduling algorithm for the first few values of y are biased to certain combinations of secret key bytes. These correlations were theoretically studied by Paul and Maitra (SAC, 2007). The formula for the correlation probabilities provided by them gives a wrong impression that the probabilities decrease as the value of y becomes larger, which is not true. In this paper, we point out some gaps in their analysis and present a detailed analysis of Roos bias. We provide a more accurate formula for the correlation probabilities.

In this work we analyze a new class of serial matrices which are the lightest possible 4 × 4 serial matrix that can be used to build diffusion layers. With this new matrix we show that block ciphers like LED can be implemented with a reduced area in hardware designs, though it has to be cycled for more iterations. Further, we suggest the usage of an alternative S-box to the standard S-box used in LED with similar cryptographic robustness, albeit having lesser area footprint. Finally, we combine these ideas in an end-end FPGA based prototype of LED. We show that with these optimizations, there is a reduction of 16 % in area footprint of one round implementation of LED. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",LED; Lightweight; MDS matrix; Recursive diffusion layer; S-box; Serial matrix,Cryptography; Diffusion; Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Block ciphers; Diffusion layers; Hardware design; Lightweight; Lightweight block ciphers; Lightweight design; MDS matrices; S-box; Light emitting diodes,"Sarkar, S.; TCS Innovation LabsIndia; email: sumanta.sarkar1@tcs.com",Patra A.Smart N.P.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Even though VCS has the major advantage that the decoding can be done with the help of Human Visual System (HVS), yet it does not provide sufficient reconstruction quality. Hence, Two in One Image Secret Sharing Scheme (TiOISSS) is used which provides two decoding phases. However, the existing TiOISSS method has several limitations. In this work, a Modified TiOISSS is proposed in which an adaptive threshold is used for halftoning, which changes depending on the nature of the pixels present in image. By this, the quality of reconstructed secret image is improved in the first decoding stage compared to the existing scheme. In addition, the security is also enhanced by pixel and bit level permutation with a 64 bit key and embedding the key in Gray VCS shadows. To verify the authenticity of the image, a secret message is also embedded in the shadows. Security analysis shows that the Modified TiOISSS is robust to Brute Force and Man-in-Middle attacks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Adaptive halftoning; Halftoning; Polynomial image secret sharing; Visual cryptography,Cryptography; Decoding; Pixels; Cryptographic techniques; Halftoning; Human visual systems; Image secret sharing; Man-in-middle attacks; Reconstruction quality; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Image processing,"Sudha, G.F.; Department of Electronics & Communication, Pondicherry Engineering CollegeIndia; email: gfsudha@pec.edu",,Springer New York LLC,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947770950

Informally, NMCs are defined with respect to a family of tampering functions F and guarantee that any tampered codeword either decodes to the same message or to an independent message, so long as it is tampered using a function f? F. Nearly all known constructions of NMCs are for the t-split-state family, where the adversary tampers each of the t “states” of a codeword, arbitrarily but independently. Cheraghchi and Guruswami (TCC 2014) obtain a Rate-1 non-malleable code for the case where t= O(n) with n being the codeword length and, in (ITCS 2014), show an upper bound of 1 - 1/ t on the best achievable rate for any t-split state NMC. For t= 10, Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman (FOCS 2014) achieve a constant rate construction where the constant is unknown. In summary, there is no known construction of an NMC with an explicit constant rate for any t= o(n), let alone one that comes close to matching Cheraghchi and Guruswami’s lowerbound! In this work, we construct an efficient non-malleable code in the t-split-state model, for t= 4, that achieves a constant rate of 13+?, for any constant ?> 0, and error 2-?(?/logc+1?), where ? is the length of the message and c> 0 is a constant. © 2017, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,Codes (symbols); Cryptography; Decoding; Errors; Codeword; Codeword length; Constant rate; Error correcting code; Lower bounds; Non-malleable codes; T-split; Upper Bound; C (programming language),"Kanukurthi, B.; Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: bhavana@iisc.ac.in",Kalai Y.Reyzin L.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

This research work proposes a novel idea of integrating number theoretic approach with Henon map for secure and efficient encryption.

The conventional SSS share one secret image to n participants. With the advancement of time, there arises a need for sharing multiple secret image. An (n, n)-Multi-Secret Image Sharing (MSIS) scheme is used to encrypt n secret images into n meaningless shared images and stored it in different database servers. For recovery of secrets all n shared images are required. In earlier work n secret images are shared among n or n + 1 shared images, which has a problem as one can recover fractional information from less than n shared images. Therefore, we need a more efficient and secure (n, n)-MSIS scheme so that less than n shared images do not reveal fractional information. In this paper, we propose an (n, n)-MSIS scheme using additive modulo and reverse bit operation for binary, grayscale, and colored images. The experimental results report that the proposed scheme requires minimal computation time for encryption and decryption.

But with increase in popularity, the chat applications have simultaneously witnessed an abrupt rise in security threats from across the globe. Coping up with the various security requirements has always been challenging. To provide a secure communication, many researchers have designed chat applications under the canopy of public key infrastructure (PKI). But public key infrastructure poses a major drawback which may increase the communication overhead. In order to communicate using a PKI based chat application, a user must have a valid certificate signed by a valid Certificate Authority. This overhead will get costlier as more users register in to the chat system. To overcome this problem, a new security system for cross platform chat application based on Identity Based Encryption (IBE) is discussed in this paper.

Cryptography establishes a secure channel for data communication between sender and receiver among smart devices. In the present scenario information security has became a predominant issue. Cryptography is process which encrypts the message with several permutations along with key produces cipher and decrypts the original message by performing reverse operation on cipher. It uses stochastic key generation mechanisms to enhance the security. This paper presents a partially reconfigurable key generation mechanisms suitable in cryptography applications which plays a vital role in data security. Several key generation techniques like proposed Runtime Polynomial Change through multiplexer, Jitter based random number, Fibonacci LFSR.., are multiplexed in runtime and partially reconfigurable with, selective key size to produce numerous pseudo random numbers. Unless hacker acquire the skills about unravel cipher and a procedure for key decryption it is difficult regenerate the original message. Cracking possibility is less due to pseudo random key generation mechanism in DNA form suitable for DNA Cryptography applications. DNA form has four nucleotides which are named as A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine) and T (Thymine) are the elements existing in DNA structure. Due to its evolvable nature, FPGA’s are suitable for wide variety of applications which can configure in runtime to implement custom designs and needs.

The cluster consists of GPS enabled node and antenna equipped node. The cluster that contains at least one G-Node considers the remaining energy, speed of the node along with the mobility of node to select the cluster head. In order to perform privacy and anonymity protection of cluster members, the cluster head then initializes group signature scheme. Then the secured routing technique is deployed where the routing packets are protected by encryption.

We are interested in a particular kind of garbling scheme, termed privacy-free in the literature. We show that Boolean formulas can be garbled information-theoretically in the privacy-free setting, producing no ciphertexts at all. Existing garbling schemes either rely on cryptographic assumptions (and thus require cryptographic operations to construct and evaluate garbled circuits), produce garbled circuits of non-zero size, or are restricted to low depth formulaic circuits. Our result has both theoretical and practical implications for garbled circuits as a primitive. On the theory front, our result breaks the known theoretical lower bound of one ciphertext for garbling an AND gate in this setting. As an interesting implication of producing size zero garbled circuits, our scheme scores adaptive security for free. On the practical side, our garbling scheme involves only cheap XOR operations and produces size zero garbled circuits. As a side result, we propose several interesting extensions of our scheme. Namely, we show how to garble threshold and high fan-in gates. An aspect of our garbling scheme that we believe is of theoretical interest is that it does not maintain the invariant that the garbled circuit evaluator must not at any point be in possession of both keys of any wire in the garbled circuit. Our scheme directly finds application in ZK protocols where the verification function of the language is representable by a formulaic circuit. Such examples include Boolean formula satisfiability. The ZK protocols obtained by plugging in our scheme in the known paradigm of building ZK protocols from garbled circuits offer better proof size, while relying on standard assumptions. Furthermore, the adaptivity of our garbling scheme allows us to cast our ZK protocols in the offline-online setting and offload circuit dependent communication and computation to the offline phase. As a result, the online phase enjoys communication and computation (in terms of number of symmetric key operations) complexity that are linearly proportional to the witness size alone. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",Authenticity; Formula; Garbled circuits; Information-theoretic; Privacy-free,Cryptography; Information theory; Security of data; Timing circuits; Authenticity; Boolean formula satisfiability; Cryptographic assumptions; Cryptographic operations; Formula; Garbled circuits; Information-theoretic; Linearly proportional; Boolean algebra,"Kondi, Y.; International Institute of Information Technology BangaloreIndia; email: yashvanth.kondi@iiitb.org",Shacham H.Katz J.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

It involves deploying groups of remote servers and software that are networked, that will allow centralised data storage and online access to computer services or resources. However, an important problem in public clouds is how to selectively share data based on fine-grained attribute-based access control policies while at the same time assuring confidentiality of the data and preserving the privacy of users from the cloud. Keeping in mind the confidentiality of data that must be provided, many schemes and encryption algorithms have been implemented, but most of those schemes have high computational costs and overload on the data owner. In this paper, we are proposing a hierarchy-based privacy preserving access control scheme, in which data is encrypted and decrypted by the cloud using the blinded encryption and decryption technique that retains the constant computation cost to the owner and the user for any large file size, thus it makes our scheme suitable for energy deficient devices. The experimental result shows that our scheme is more suitable for energy deficient devices without compromising the security of data.

Most of the prior works on leakage-resilient cryptography consider leakage models where the adversary has access to the leakage oracle before the challenge-ciphertext is generated (before-the-fact leakage). In this model, there are generic compilers that transform any leakage-resilient CPA-secure public key encryption (PKE) scheme to its CCA-2 variant using Naor-Yung type of transformations. In this work, we give an efficient generic compiler for transforming a leakage-resilient CPA-secure PKE to leakage-resilient CCA-2 secure PKE in presence of after-the-fact split-state (bounded) memory leakage model, where the adversary has access to the leakage oracle even after the challenge phase. The salient feature of our transformation is that the leakage rate (defined as the ratio of the amount of leakage to the size of secret key) of the transformed after-the-fact CCA-2 secure PKE is same as the leakage rate of the underlying after-the-fact CPA-secure PKE, which is 1 ? o(1).

A fully layered image encryption scheme first scrambles the image (to destroy the high correlation between neighbouring pixels) then encrypts it, resulting in a high computational overhead. In recent times, partial or selective encryption schemes are gaining popularity especially in situations demanding constrained communication such as mobile communications with limited computational power. In this paper, the performance of a chaos based partial image encryption scheme is evaluated in terms of a set of evaluation criteria. Exhaustive experimental simulation is performed to analyse the efficacy of the encryption scheme. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",Mean-Square-Error (MSE); Partial image encryption; Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR); Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index; Tuneability; Visual degradation,Image processing; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Image encryptions; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structural similarity indices (SSIM); Tuneability; Visual degradations; Cryptography,"Som, S.; Department of Computer Science, Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath CollegeIndia; email: sukalyan.s@gmail.com",Saeed K.Chaki R.Cortesi A.Chaki N.,Springer Verlag,21945357,9.78981E+12,,,English,Adv.

In such applications, resources such as data, are sensitive in nature and it is necessary that only authorized users are allowed access without the presence of on-line monitoring system. The de-facto approach is to encrypt a shared resource and deploy a key distribution mechanism, which enables only authorized users to generate the respective decryption key for the resource. The key distribution approach has two major challenges: first, the applications are dynamic i.e., users might join and leave arbitrarily, and second, for a large number of users, it is required that the cryptographic technique be scalable and efficient. In this work, we describe an approach that overcomes these challenges by using two key techniques: first, flattening the access structure and applying efficient symmetric key distribution techniques. By flattening the access structure, we reduce the problem to that of key distribution of a resource among all the users sharing that resource. We consider this smaller flattened access structure and devise a unified key distribution technique that is sufficient for key distribution across all such structures. Our key distribution techniques have an important feature of a public secret and a private secret, which allows the group controller to publish updates to the keying material using the public secret and therefore, does not necessitate the users to be in constant communication with the group controller. Using this model we describe two efficient key distribution techniques that scale logarithmically with the group size and also handle group additions and removals. Furthermore, a user can be off-line for any amount of time and need not be aware of the dynamics of the system, which is important as it overcomes the problems posed by lossy channels. We have performed an experimental evaluation of our scheme against a popular existing scheme and show that they perform better for this scheme with the same security guarantees. As our approaches are easy to implement they are especially suitable for practical applications where security is viewed as an overhead rather than as a necessity. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,Cryptography; Digital storage; Collaborative Editing; Cryptographic techniques; Distributed applications; Experimental evaluation; Group controllers; Important features; Key distribution; On-line monitoring system; Distributed computer systems,"Bezawada, B.; Mahindra Ecole CentraleIndia; email: bru@mechyd.ac.in",Martinez Perez G.Gomez Marmol F.Thampi S.M.Westphall C.B.Fan C.I.Hu J.,Springer Verlag,18650929,9.78981E+12,,,English,Commun.

This is based on the underlying model of a stream cipher with 6 LFSRs of different lengths and three additional bits. In this paper we consider the scenario that certain amount of key stream bits and some portion of the state is known. Then we try to discover the rest of the state bits. For example, we show that the LFSR of length 47 can be recovered from 47 key stream bits and guessing the rest of the state bits. We also present the implication of such results towards mounting TMDTO attack on ACORN v3. We show that a TMDTO attack can be mounted with preprocessing complexity 2171 and 2180 (without and with the help of a SAT solver) and the maximum of online time, memory and data complexity 2122 and 2120 respectively.

This considers that the stream cipher can be weakened by injection of the fault. In this paper we study DFA on three ciphers, namely Grain v1, Lizard and ACORN v3. We show that Grain v1 (an eStream cipher) can be attacked with injection of only 5 faults instead of 10 that has been reported in 2012. For the first time, we have mounted the fault attack on Lizard, a very recent design and show that one requires only 5 faults to obtain the state. ACORN v3 is a third round candidate of CAESAR and there is only one hard fault attack on an earlier version of this cipher. However, the ‘hard fault’ model requires a lot more assumption than the generic DFA. In this paper, we mount a DFA on ACORN v3 that requires 9 faults to obtain the state. In case of Grain v1 and ACORN v3, we can obtain the secret key once the state is known. However, that is not immediate in case of Lizard. While we have used the basic framework of DFA that appears in literature quite frequently, specific tweaks have to be explored to mount the actual attacks that were not used earlier. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best known DFAs on these three ciphers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",ACORN v3; Differential fault attack; Grain v1; Lizard; Stream cipher,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; ACORN v3; Differential fault attack; Hard faults; Lizard; Secret key; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,"Sarkar, S.; Department of Mathematics, IIT MadrasIndia; email: sarkarsantanubir@gmail.com",Ali S.S.Eisenbarth T.Danger J.-L.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In this work, we significantly improve its performance and flexibility. We term this new construction as eSPF. Unlike SPF, all the basic transformations of eSPF are defined under the field Fp. This allows us to use a MDS matrix instead of the binary matrix used in SPF. The optimal diffusion of MDS matrix leads to an efficient and secure design. However, this change leads to violations in the message format. To mitigate this, we propose a discarding algorithm to drop the symbols that are not the elements of the format thus preserving it. We also present a concrete instantiation of eSPF for digits and its comparison with existing FPE algorithms like FFX and SPF.

Deduplication is an effective data reduction technique to minimize the storage cost as well as communication cost. However, Deduplication raises significant security issues. Malicious users and semi-trusted Storage Server tries to learn the data outsourced by other users. Encrypting the data at user side before uploading to Storage Server is essential for protecting outsourced data. However, conventional deterministic encryption techniques are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks for predictable files. In this paper, we propose secure random key based encryption technique for Deduplicated Storage. In our approach, user encrypts the file with a randomly chosen key. Random key is encrypted by set of hash values generated from plaintext file. In this way, our approach provides protection against brute-force attack and dictionary attack. We analyze security of our approach with theoretical proof and experimental analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Computer crime; Digital storage; Information systems; Brute-force attack; Communication cost; Deterministic encryptions; Dictionary attack; Encryption technique; Experimental analysis; Outsourced datum; Reduction techniques; Cryptography,"Dave, J.; Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: jaydaveadms@gmail.com",Vaidya J.Shyamasundar R.K.Singh V.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

MDS matrices are not sparse and have a large description and thus induce costly implementation in software/hardware. To overcome this problem, in particular for applications in light-weight cryptography, it was proposed by Guo et al. to use recursive MDS matrices. A recursive MDS matrix is an MDS matrix which can be expressed as a power of some companion matrix. Following the work of Guo et al., some ad-hoc search techniques are proposed to find recursive MDS matrices which are suitable for hardware/software implementation. In another direction, coding theoretic techniques are used to directly construct recursive MDS matrices: Berger technique uses Gabidulin codes and Augot et al. technique uses shortened BCH codes. In this paper, we first characterize the polynomials that yield recursive MDS matrices in a more general setting. Based on this we provide three methods for obtaining such polynomials. Moreover, the recursive MDS matrices obtained using shortened BCH codes can also be obtained with our first method. In fact we get a larger set of polynomials than the method which uses shortened BCH codes. Our other methods appear similar to the method which uses Gabidulin codes. We get a new infinite class of recursive MDS matrices from one of the proposed methods. Although we propose three methods for the direct construction of recursive MDS matrices, our characterization results pave the way for new direct constructions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",BCH codes; Companion matrices; Cyclic codes; Diffusion layer; Gabidulin codes; MDS codes; Recursive MDS matrices,Aluminum; Codes (symbols); Cryptography; Hash functions; Polynomials; BCH code; Cyclic code; Diffusion layers; Gabidulin codes; MDS code; MDS matrices; Matrix algebra,"Venkateswarlu, A.; Computer Science Unit, Indian Statistical Institute - Chennai Centre, MGR Knowledge City Road, Taramani, India; email: venku@isichennai.res.in",,Springer New York LLC,9251022,,DCCRE,,English,Des Codes Cryptography,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982813102

One of the finest and most popular technologies available for handling and processing that enormous amount of data is the Hadoop ecosystem. Enterprises are increasingly relying on Hadoop for storing their valuable data and processing it. However, Hadoop is still evolving. There is much vulnerability found in Hadoop, which can question the security of the sensitive information that enterprises are storing on it. In this paper, security issues associated with the framework have been identified. We have also tried to give a brief overview of the currently available solutions and what are their limitations. At the end a novel method is introduced, which can be used to eliminate the found vulnerabilities in the framework. In the modern era, information security has become a fundamental necessity for each and every individual. However, not everyone can afford the specialized distributions provided by different vendors to their Hadoop cluster.

In many situations, it is desirable and essential to have the ciphertext follow the same format as the plaintext. Moreover, ciphertext length expansion is also not allowed in these situations. Encryption of credit card numbers and social security numbers are the two most common examples of this requirement. Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) is a symmetric key cryptographic primitive that is used to achieve this functionality. Initiated by the work of Black and Rogaway (CT-RSA 2002), many academic solutions have been proposed in literature that have focused on designing efficient FPE schemes. However, almost all the existing FPE schemes are based on Feistel construction and have efficiency issues. In this work, we propose a new family of efficient FPE schemes that are Substitution-Permutation (SP) based constructions at their core. We term it as SPF family of FPE schemes. All the underlying SP transformations in these constructions have been defined such that they preserve the format of the data. We then demonstrate an instance of our construction applicable for digits. We show that our scheme is at least 5 times more efficient than existing FPE designs for most of the practical applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Active S-boxes; Binary matrix; Format-preserving encryption; MDS matrix; SPN,Matrix algebra; Security of data; Binary matrix; Cryptographic primitives; Encryption methods; Feistel constructions; Format-preserving encryptions; MDS matrices; S-boxes; Social security numbers; Cryptography,"Kumar, A.; Indraprastha Institute of Information TechnologyIndia; email: abhishekk@iiitd.ac.in",Chen K.Lin D.Yung M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic algorithm that provides confidentiality of data along with owner-enforced fine-grained access control. With attribute-based encryption, a data owner can use a set of attribute values (i.e., access policy) for encrypting a message such that only authorized entity who possesses the required set of attribute values can decrypt the ciphertext. In this paper, we propose a proxy re-encryption scheme using the merits of ciphertext-policy anonymous attribute-based encryption. The proposed scheme, termed as PRE-AABE, reduces the computation burden significantly for updating the access policy of a ciphertext to a semi-trusted proxy agent (e.g., cloud server). The proposed PRE-AABE scheme hides the access policy inside the ciphertext, so that parties except the intended receiver will not be able to figure out the purpose of the ciphertext. At the same time, the proxy agent is able to perform the re-encryption successfully without learning anything about the plaintext contents or the access policy. We show that the proposed PRE-AABE scheme is secure in IND-CP-CPA (indistinguishability against ciphertext-policy and chosen-plaintext attack) under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Assumption. We provide the experimental results of the scheme and show that PRE-AABE scheme is efficient and practical. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Access structure; Anonymity; Attribute-based encryption; Proxy re-encryption,Access control; Data privacy; Information systems; Security of data; Access structure; Anonymity; Attribute-based encryptions; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic primitives; Diffie-Hellman assumption; Proxy re encryptions; Proxy re-encryption schemes; Cryptography,"Das, M.L.; DA-IICTIndia; email: maniklal_das@daiict.ac.in",Vaidya J.Shyamasundar R.K.Singh V.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

In case there are biases in the state bits, that may be reflected on the key-stream bits resulting certain weaknesses (distinguisher and/or key recovery) of the cipher. In this context, we study the state biases as well as key-stream biases with great details. We first experiment with cube testers and heuristically obtain several distinguishers for Trivium running more than 800 rounds (maximum 829) with cube sizes not exceeding 27. Further, we apply our techniques to analyze Trivia-SC (the stream cipher used in TriviA-ck AEAD scheme, selected in second round of CAESAR competition) and obtain distinguishers till 950 rounds with a cube size of 25 only. On Trivia-SC, our results refute certain claims made by the designers against both cube and slide attacks.

Different security services such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, non-repudiation and access control, are provided by a number of cryptographic algorithms including block ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions. Though the algorithms are public and cryptographic strength depends on the usage of the keys, the ciphertext analysis using different functions and operations used in the algorithms can lead to the path of revealing a key completely or partially. It is hard to find any survey till date which identifies different operations and functions used in cryptography. In this paper, we have categorized our survey of cryptographic functions and operations in the algorithms in three categories: block ciphers, stream ciphers and cryptanalysis attacks which are executable in different parts of the algorithms. This survey will help the budding researchers in the society of crypto for identifying different operations and functions in cryptographic algorithms. © 2017 SERSC Australia.",Block; Cipher; Ciphertext; Cryptography; Functions; Plaintext; Research problems; Stream,,,,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,20054262,,,,English,Int.

The safety of conventional ID-based cryptographic protocol is entirely contingent in light of the safety of private keys. Revelation of private keys needs reissuing all beforehand doled out encryptions. This confinement turns out to be clearer today as key presentation is more regular with expanding utilization of unprotected gadgets and mobile technology. In this context, relieving the loss of key disclosure in ID-based cryptographic protocol is a critical issue. To manage this issue, we present to include onward security into ID-based cryptographic protocol. Besides, we propose another development of indistinguishability-ID-based cryptographic protocol using Integer Factorization Problem (IFP) and Generalized Discrete Logarithm Problem (GDLP) which is semantically protected against Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA) in random oracle. We show that our presented protocol beats the other standing protocol as far as security, the length of public key and computational cost are concerned.

Once the data is stored, the client supplies some keywords to the cloud server and requests the corresponding data. If the data is stored in plaintext form, data privacy will be violated. Thus the client encrypts the data along with the realted keywords, and then stores the ciphertext in the cloud server. Encryption of data maintains the confidentiality, but this makes keyword search difficult. To solve this issue, designated server based public key encryption with keyword search (dPEKS) scheme is used. In dPEKS scheme, to get the encrypted data, the client computes a trapdoor related to a relevant keyword, and sends it to the cloud server, which then gives the ciphertext to the client provided that the trapdoor is verified. Hence, the client gets the data from the ciphertext. However, an adversary will not get any information on the data or the keywords. A certificatelessdPEKS (CL-dPEKS) scheme is proposed in this paper. It provides indistinguishability to the ciphertext and trapdoor, and resilience to off-line keyword guessing attack.

In this model, security of the scheme is guaranteed as long as the number of colluding adversaries can be a-priori bounded by some polynomial Q. Our construction supports arithmetic circuits in contrast to all prior work which support Boolean circuits. The ciphertext of our scheme is sublinear in the circuit size for the circuit class NC1; this implies the first construction of arithmetic reusable garbled circuits for NC1. Additionally, our construction achieves several desirable features: Our construction for reusable garbled circuits for NC1 achieves the optimal “full” simulation based security.When generalised to handle Q queries for any fixed polynomial Q, our ciphertext size grows additively with Q2. In contrast, previous works that achieve full security [5, 39] suffered a multiplicative growth of Q4.The ciphertext of our scheme can be divided into a succinct data dependent component and a non-succinct data independent component. This makes it well suited for optimization in an online-offline model that allows a majority of the computation to be performed in an offline phase, before the data becomes available. Security of our reusable garbled circuits construction for NC1 is based on the Ring Learning With Errors assumption (RLWE), while the bounded collusion construction (with non-succinct ciphertext) may also be based on the standard Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. To achieve our result, we provide new public key and ciphertext evaluation algorithms.

In this ubiquitous environment, due to the heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects, conventional authentication schemes may not meet the IoT security requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated. In this paper, a two-factor inter device mutual authentication scheme for smart home is proposed, where in the first level, the key exchange is performed using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and a public key cryptography in order to validate the identity of devices; and the second level relies on the use of infrared communication to distribute the One-Time Passwords (OTPs) among devices for authentication purpose. The HLPSL language is used to model the proposed protocol, and a security analysis is conducted using the SPAN (Security Protocol Animator for AVISPA (SPAN)/AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Applications) tool, showing that the proposed scheme can achieve the goals of secrecy of secret keys and mutual authentication. A proof-of-concept in the form of a hardware design is also proposed using Raspberry-Pi, Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC), Infrared circuit and a public-key-infrastructure. Experimentally, it is shown that this hardware design can achieve secure device-to-device authentication. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Authentication; Automation; Chaos theory; Computer operating systems; Cryptography; Hardware; Intelligent buildings; Network security; Public key cryptography; Remote control; Device authentications; Diffie-Hellman protocol; Infrared communication; Infrared remote control; Internet of Things (IOT); Public key infrastructure; Security requirements; Ubiquitous environments; Internet of things,"Woungang, I.; Department of Computer Science, Ryerson UniversityCanada; email: iwoungan@scs.ryerson.ca",Awad A.Traore I.Woungang I.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Initially, secret sharing schemes were considered with the presumption that the corrupted participants involved in a protocol behave in a passive manner and submit correct shares during the reconstruction of secret. However, that may not be the case in practical situations. A minimal robust requirement, when a fraction of participants behave maliciously and submit incorrect shares, is that, the set of all shares, some possibly corrupted, can recover the correct secret. Though the concept of robustness is well studied for secret sharing schemes, it is not at all common in the field of visual cryptography. We, for the first time in the literature of visual cryptography, formally define the concept of robustness and put forward (2, n)-threshold visual cryptographic schemes that are robust against deterministic cheating. In the robust secret sharing schemes it is assumed that the number of cheaters is always less than the threshold value so that the original secret is not recovered by the coalition of cheaters only. In the current paper, We consider three different scenarios with respect to the number of cheaters controlled by a centralized adversary. We first consider the existence of only one cheater in a (2, n)-threshold VCS so that the secret image is not recovered by the cheater. Next we consider two different cases, with number of cheaters being greater than 2, with honest majority and without honest majority. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Basis matrices; Deterministic cheating; Robustness; Visual cryptography,Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Information theory; Recovery; Robustness (control systems); Cryptographic schemes; Deterministic cheating; Mathematical computation; Secret images; Secret reconstruction; Secret sharing schemes; Threshold-value; Visual cryptography; Cryptography,"Adhikari, A.; Department of Pure Mathematics, University of CalcuttaIndia; email: avishek.adh@gmail.com",Kim H.J.Liu F.Perez-Gonzalez F.Shi Y.Q.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Tenant Virtual Machine (VM) level security solutions can be easily evaded by modern attack techniques. Out-VM monitoring allows cloud administrator (CA) to monitor and control a VM from a secure location outside the VM. In this paper, we propose an out-VM monitoring based approach named as 'Program Semantic-Aware Intrusion Detection at Network and Hypervisor Layer' (PSI-NetVisor) to detect attacks in both network and virtualization layer in cloud. PSI-NetVisor performs network monitoring by employing behavior based intrusion detection approach (BIDA) at the network layer of centralized Cloud Network Server (CNS); providing the first level of defense from attacks. It incorporates semantic awareness in the intrusion detection approach and enables it to provide network monitoring and process monitoring at the hypervisor layer of Cloud Compute Server (CCoS); providing the second level of defense from attacks. PSI-NetVisor employs Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) libraries based on software break point injection to extract process execution traces from hypervisor. It further applies depth first search (DFS) to construct program semantics from control flow graph of execution traces. It applies dynamic analysis and machine learning approaches to learn the behavior of anomalies which makes it secure from obfuscation and encryption based attacks. PSI-NetVisor has been validated with latest intrusion datasets (UNSW-NB & Evasive Malware) collected from research centers and results seem to be promising. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

For instance, it captures real-world scenarios where “hackers” actively break into computers, possibly while they are executing secure protocols. Studying this setting is interesting from both theoretical and practical points of view. A primary building block in designing adaptively secure protocols is a non-committing encryption (NCE) that implements secure communication channels in the presence of adaptive corruptions. Current constructions require a number of public key operations that grow linearly with the length of the message. Furthermore, general two-party protocols require a number of NCE calls that dependent both on the circuit size and on the security parameter. In this paper, we study the two-party setting in which at most one of the parties is adaptively corrupted, and demonstrate the feasibility of (1) NCE with constant number of public key operations for large message spaces, (2) oblivious transfer with constant number of public key operations for large sender’s input spaces, and (3) constant round secure computation protocols with an overall number of public key operations that is linear in the circuit size. Our study demonstrates that such primitives indeed exist in the presence of single corruptions without erasures, while this is not known for fully adaptive security under standard assumptions (where both parties may get corrupted). Our results are shown in the UC setting with a CRS setup. © 2015, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Adaptive security; Non-committing encryption; Oblivious transfer; Secure two-party computation,Personal computing; Reconfigurable hardware; Adaptive corruptions; Adaptive security; Current construction; Oblivious transfer; Real-world scenario; Secure two-party computations; Security parameters; Standard assumptions; Cryptography,"Patra, A.; Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: arpitapatra10@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,9332790,,JOCRE,,English,J.

To avoid the overhead due to certification and to get rid of the key escrow issue of identity-based setting, we construct our scheme on the certificateless setting.

Road, Kolkata, 700108, India","This work considers the problem of fast and secure scalar multiplication using curves of genus one defined over a field of prime order. Previous work by Gaudry and Lubicz in 2009 had suggested the use of the associated Kummer line to speed up scalar multiplication. In this work, we explore this idea in detail. The first task is to obtain an elliptic curve in Legendre form which satisfies necessary security conditions such that the associated Kummer line has small parameters and a base point with small coordinates. In turns out that the ladder step on the Kummer line supports parallelism and can be implemented very efficiently in constant time using the single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations available in modern processors. For the 128-bit security level, this work presents three Kummer lines denoted as K1: = KL2519(81, 20), K2: = KL25519(82, 77) and K3: = KL2663(260, 139) over the three primes 2 251- 9, 2 255- 19 and 2 266- 3 respectively. Implementations of scalar multiplications for all the three Kummer lines using Intel intrinsics have been done and the code is publicly available. Timing results on the recent Skylake and the earlier Haswell processors of Intel indicate that both fixed base and variable base scalar multiplications for K1 and K2 are faster than those achieved by Sandy2x which is a highly optimised SIMD implementation in assembly of the well known Curve25519; for example, on Skylake, variable base scalar multiplication on K1 is faster than Curve25519 by about 25%. On Skylake, both fixed base and variable base scalar multiplication for K3 are faster than Sandy2x; whereas on Haswell, fixed base scalar multiplication for K3 is faster than Sandy2x while variable base scalar multiplication for both K3 and Sandy2x take roughly the same time. In fact, on Skylake, K3 is both faster and also offers about 5 bits of higher security compared to Curve25519. In practical terms, the particular Kummer lines that are introduced in this work are serious candidates for deployment and standardisation. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",Elliptic curve cryptography; Kummer line; Montgomery curve; Scalar multiplication,Geometry; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography; Kummer line; Modern processors; Montgomery; Scalar multiplication; Security level; Single instruction multiple data; Cryptography,"Karati, S.; ICIS Lab, Department of Computer Science, University of CalgaryCanada; email: sabyasachi.karati@ucalgary.ca",Takagi T.Peyrin T.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Enterprise needs to entrust untrusted cloud service provider, which gives rise to various security and privacy concerns. To address these concerns, numerous schemes in cloud computing employed attribute-based encryption schemes. However, existing schemes are neither flexible enough to provide users complete liberty on delegation of their access privileges nor grant shared access privileges among users of a group to jointly address a responsibility. This paper introduces hierarchical attribute-set-based access control scheme by employing ciphertext-policy attribute-set-based encryption with a hierarchical structure of users to achieve scalability. The proposed scheme simultaneously achieves the notion of fine-grained cum flexible access control, privacy preserving, efficient data utilization and imperatively provides users full-fledged liberty on delegation of their access privileges. Furthermore, we formally prove that proposed scheme is secure under decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption. © 2016",Cloud computing; Cloud storage security; Full-fledged delegation; Privacy-preserving; security; Shared access privileges,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Network security; Cloud storage securities; Full-fledged delegation; Privacy preserving; Security; Shared access privileges; Access control,"Ahuja, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing Jabalpur, India; email: rohitsureshahuja@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,457906,,CPEEB,,English,Comput Electr Eng,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007441098

In recent publications, several different threshold implementations of AES have been designed. However in most of the threshold implementations of AES, the Canright S-Box has been used. The Boyar-Peralta S-Box is an alternative implementation of the AES S-Box with a minimal circuit depth and is comparable in size to the frequently used Canright AES S-Box. In this paper, we present several versions of first-order threshold implementations of the Boyar-Peralta AES S-Box with different number of shares and several trade-offs in area, randomness and speed. To the best of our knowledge these are the first threshold implementations of the Boyar-Peralta S-Box. Our implementations compare favourably with some of the existing threshold implementations of Canright S-Box along the design trade-offs, e.g. while one of our S-Boxes is 49% larger in area than the smallest known threshold implementation of the Canright AES S-Box, it uses 63% less randomness and requires only 50% of the clock cycles.

Several authors have put forward various authentication protocols for multi-server environment during the past decade. Wang et al. recently proposed a biometric-based authentication with key agreement protocol for multi-server environment and claimed that their protocol is efficient and resistant to prominent security attacks. The careful investigation of this paper shows that Wang et al. protocol's users are sharing personal identifiable information with the application servers during the registration and authentication process. This nature of disclosing credentials leads to severe threats particularly insider attacks, user impersonation attacks, and server impersonation attacks. As a remedy of the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a novel biometric-based mutually authenticated key agreement protocols for multi-server architecture based on elliptic curve cryptography. We prove that the proposed protocol achieves secure mutual authentication property using the broadly used Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. The formal security of the proposed protocol is verified using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool to show that our protocol can withstand active and passive attacks including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Their construction of LR-NIKE was only in the bounded-memory leakage model, and they left open the construction of LR-NIKE in continuous-memory leakage model. In this paper we address that open problem. Moreover, we extend the continuous-memory leakage model by addressing more realistic after-the-fact leakage. The main ingredients of our construction are a leakage-resilient storage scheme and a refreshing protocol (Dziembowski and Faust, Asiacrypt 2011) and a (standard) chameleon hash function (CHF), equipped with an additional property of oblivious sampling, which we introduce. We observe that the present constructions of CHF already satisfies our new notion. Further, our protocol can be used as a building block to construct leakage-resilient public-key encryption schemes, interactive key exchange and low-latency key exchange protocols in the continuous-memory leakage model, following the approach of Chakraborty et al.

The most commonly used pairings are constructed from elliptic curves over finite fields with small embedding degree. These pairings can have different security, performance, and functionality characteristics, and were therefore classified into Types 1, 2, 3 and 4. In this paper, we observe that this conventional classification is not applicable to pairings from elliptic curves with embedding degree one. It is important to understand the security, efficiency, and functionality of these pairings in light of recent attacks on certain pairings constructed from elliptic curves with embedding degree greater than one. We define three kinds of pairings from elliptic curves with embedding degree one, discuss some subtleties with using them to implement pairing-based protocols, and provide an estimated cost of implementing them on modern processors. © 2017 IEEE.",Bilinear pairings; BLS signature scheme; Elliptic curves with embedding degree one; Tate pairing; Weil pairing,Cryptography; Public key cryptography; Bilinear pairing; Elliptic curve; Signature Scheme; Tate pairing; Weil pairing; Geometry,,,IEEE Computer Society,189340,,ITCOB,,English,IEEE Trans Comput,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028030247

The scheme is called COFB, for COmbined FeedBack. COFB uses an n-bit blockcipher as the underlying primitive, and relies on the use of a nonce for security. In addition to the state required for executing the underlying blockcipher, COFB needs only n/2 bits state as a mask. Till date, for all existing constructions in which masks have been applied, at least n bit masks have been used. Thus, we have shown the possibility of reducing the size of a mask without degrading the security level much. Moreover, it requires one blockcipher call to process one input block. We show COFB is provably secure up to O(2n/2/n) queries which is almost up to the standard birthday bound. We also present our hardware implementation results.

Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a viable solution, particularly for cloud deployment, as an encryptor can 'write' the access policy so that only authorized users can decrypt and have access to the data. However, most existing CP-ABE schemes are based on the costly bilinear maps, and require long decryption keys, ciphertexts and incur significant computation costs in the encryption and decryption (e.g. costs is at least linear to the number of attributes involved in the access policy). These design drawbacks prevent the deployment of CP-ABE schemes on battery-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a new RSA-based CP-ABE scheme with constant size secret keys and ciphertexts (CSKC) and has O(1) time-complexity for each decryption and encryption. Our scheme is then shown to be secure against a chosen-ciphertext adversary, as well as been an efficient solution with the expressive AND gate access structures (in comparison to other related existing schemes).

Specifically, we provide a new oblivious transfer (OT) protocol with a laconic receiver. Laconic OT allows a receiver to commit to a large input D (of length M) via a short message. Subsequently, a single short message by a sender allows the receiver to learn mD[L], where the messages m0,m1 and the location L ? [M] are dynamically chosen by the sender. All prior constructions of OT required the receiver’s outgoing message to grow with D. Our key contribution is an instantiation of this primitive based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption in the common reference string (CRS) model. The technical core of this construction is a novel use of somewhere statistically binding (SSB) hashing in conjunction with hash proof systems. Next, we show applications of laconic OT to non-interactive secure computation on large inputs and multi-hop homomorphic encryption for RAM programs. © 2017, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,Application programs; Common reference string models; Decisional diffie hellman; Hash Proof Systems; Ho-momorphic encryptions; ITS applications; Novel techniques; Oblivious transfer; Secure computation; Cryptography,"Cho, C.; HRL LaboratoriesUnited States; email: lewisccho@gmail.com",Katz J.Shacham H.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

However, mobile users can be vulnerable to various attacks by adversaries, because the roaming services are provided through public network. Therefore, an anonymous mobile user authentication for roaming services is an essential security issue in global mobility networks. Recently, Lee et al. pointed out the security weaknesses of a previous scheme and proposed an advanced secure anonymous authentication scheme for roaming services in global mobility networks. However, we found that the scheme proposed by Lee et al. is vulnerable to password guessing and user impersonation attacks, and that it cannot provide perfect forward secrecy and secure password altered phase. In this paper, to overcome the security weaknesses of the scheme proposed by Lee et al., we propose an improved secure anonymous authentication scheme using shared secret keys between home agent and foreign agent. In addition, we analyze the security of our proposed scheme against various attacks and prove that it provides secure mutual authentication using Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic. In addition, the formal security analysis using the broadly-accepted real-or-random (ROR) random oracle model and the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of the Internet security protocols and applications tool show that the proposed scheme provides the session key security and protection against replay as well as man-in-the-middle attacks, respectively. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the related schemes, and the results show that the proposed scheme provides better security and comparable efficiency as compared with those for the existing schemes. © 2017 IEEE.",Authentication; AVISPA simulation; BAN logic; Formal security; Global mobility networks; Key agreement; Roaming services; ROR model,Authentication; Computer circuits; Cryptography; Internet protocols; Mobile devices; AVISPA simulation; BAN logic; Formal security; Global mobility network; Key agreement; Roaming services; Network security,"Park, Y.; School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National UniversitySouth Korea; email: parkyh@knu.ac.kr",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041488575
